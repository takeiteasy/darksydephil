I've been a fan of DSP since 24 BC, and I needed a way to keep track of Phil's, near constant, dire financial situation. So I can donate more.

This sources data from his Twitch chatlogs and his Patreon. Theres no point in trying to add his Youtube statistics, because there is no reliable source.

There is also a couple of scripts in [tools](https://gist.github.com/takeiteasy/1ff57efecc9d25ac55eac00038108b64/1612c9f50ca67dc216b193a6124e6f363dda146a)

```
dsp-cheers.py [date (year-month-day)] <- counts total/avg. cheers for a given date
dsp-subscribers.py [date (month-year)] <- counts total subscribers for a given month
```
