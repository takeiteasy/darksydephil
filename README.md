# the snort report

I've been a fan of DSP since 24 BC, and I needed a way to keep track of Phil's, near constant, dire financial situation. So I can donate more.

This sources data from his Twitch chatlogs and his Patreon. Theres no point in trying to add his Youtube statistics, because there is no reliable source.

Data sourced from: [overrustlelogs.net](https://overrustlelogs.net/Darksydephil%20chatlog), [graphtreon.com](https://graphtreon.com/creator/darksydephil)
Charts generated by [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org), json parser used [js0n](https://github.com/quartzjer/js0n)
Note: This doesn't include his Youtube money, shirt money or whatever else.

There is also a couple of scripts [here](https://gist.github.com/takeiteasy/1ff57efecc9d25ac55eac00038108b64/1612c9f50ca67dc216b193a6124e6f363dda146a)
