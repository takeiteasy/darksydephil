[2017-02-20 00:27:59 UTC] gladefinder: Some characters in overwatch you have to really change your usual strategy, and idk if Phil got that. Like I think with Phara you have to be more on top as a sniper, use your jumping a lot more

[2017-02-20 00:32:13 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Huh. I suppose so
[2017-02-20 00:32:15 UTC] damienelmaskador: did they say they would remake the 1? With sub missions and cameo of Akiyama workint at Toto Bank and getting wtf when Majima rams into the wall with his van? :P

[2017-02-20 00:44:32 UTC] anondublo1: that's the main reason i bought an actual ps2 tbh, emulators weren't working well for the games i wanted to play
[2017-02-20 00:44:39 UTC] anondublo1: but monster hunter works Kappa
[2017-02-20 00:44:43 UTC] capstonegaming: worked good a f for me
[2017-02-20 00:44:51 UTC] yacherdy: Thing with PS2 emulators on PC you have to have a decent rig to run it
[2017-02-20 00:44:55 UTC] capstonegaming: games run better on computers since ps2 is inferior cpu
[2017-02-20 00:44:58 UTC] shaneh87: true
[2017-02-20 00:45:02 UTC] anondublo1: some games run fine, others don't

[2017-02-20 00:57:10 UTC] anondublo1: but only few fap on stream (for free) Kappa
[2017-02-20 00:57:17 UTC] yacherdy: "it"
[2017-02-20 00:57:25 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Phil needs to do an entire intro of him fapping Kappa
[2017-02-20 00:57:27 UTC] azuredragoongx1: It seems Phil really likes the mayhem styles
[2017-02-20 00:57:29 UTC] gladefinder: embrace it firlmy
[2017-02-20 00:57:32 UTC] bethe2670: the game was too pixelly
[2017-02-20 00:57:32 UTC] bentboxer: wheres the capoeira attacks?
[2017-02-20 00:57:34 UTC] capstonegaming: XD
[2017-02-20 00:57:39 UTC] capstonegaming: different character
[2017-02-20 00:57:43 UTC] bethe2670: Kappa
[2017-02-20 00:57:44 UTC] azuredragoongx1: @bentboxer Kiryu ain't like that
[2017-02-20 00:57:50 UTC] capstonegaming: reverse last ride
[2017-02-20 00:57:50 UTC] azuredragoongx1: He's more of a kickboxer
[2017-02-20 00:58:02 UTC] gladefinder: fart doctor
[2017-02-20 00:58:04 UTC] ginosaji48: its from fucking 2002 bethe....smh
[2017-02-20 00:58:25 UTC] eternia_forever: alright so 1 more hour then
[2017-02-20 00:58:30 UTC] bethe2670: joe didnt speak and vito didnt sound italian
[2017-02-20 00:58:36 UTC] anondublo1: hey gino
[2017-02-20 00:58:38 UTC] gladefinder: the onlookers are used to it. this is martial Japan
[2017-02-20 00:58:39 UTC] anondublo1: Mafia 3
[2017-02-20 00:58:49 UTC] ginosaji48: they changed fucking voice actors
[2017-02-20 00:58:53 UTC] capstonegaming: fuck mafia games
[2017-02-20 00:58:56 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Oooooooo
[2017-02-20 00:58:58 UTC] capstonegaming: never been SHIT
[2017-02-20 00:59:11 UTC] gladefinder: a fight breaks out in the streets at night on every corner at every hour
[2017-02-20 00:59:14 UTC] capstonegaming: yakuza > mafia wtf is mafia ? nobody would miss it
[2017-02-20 00:59:25 UTC] ginosaji48: .....
[2017-02-20 00:59:32 UTC] yacherdy: 150 viewers
[2017-02-20 00:59:34 UTC] bethe2670: gino were they credited in the credits?
[2017-02-20 00:59:38 UTC] eternia_forever: make phils youtube views great again
[2017-02-20 00:59:42 UTC] anondublo1: Mafia 1 is alright. 2 is good, but has no content.
[2017-02-20 00:59:45 UTC] azuredragoongx1: 1988 Japan is very weird xD
[2017-02-20 00:59:47 UTC] ginosaji48: have it your way
[2017-02-20 00:59:49 UTC] gladefinder: mafia is that game you play when young and have to figure out which townspeople are the killers
[2017-02-20 00:59:52 UTC] anondublo1: Mafia 3 is... Mafia 3.
[2017-02-20 00:59:58 UTC] capstonegaming: I never played mafia
[2017-02-20 01:00:08 UTC] capstonegaming: but the first one made sense but as time went on
[2017-02-20 01:00:10 UTC] bentboxer: i went to collect rent today and it wasnt the same as 35 mil...
[2017-02-20 01:00:18 UTC] capstonegaming: if ur not gonna compete dont play
[2017-02-20 01:00:45 UTC] capstonegaming: mafia , saints row, or gta?
[2017-02-20 01:00:49 UTC] spade137: cp PogChamp
[2017-02-20 01:00:51 UTC] capstonegaming: or buishock infinite
[2017-02-20 01:00:54 UTC] gladefinder: this game is like Persona right. Japanese
[2017-02-20 01:01:13 UTC] anondublo1: Hard to compare.
[2017-02-20 01:01:23 UTC] yacherdy: damn sexy time music
[2017-02-20 01:01:29 UTC] anondublo1: Saints row is more like the 3D gta games.
[2017-02-20 01:01:35 UTC] damienelmaskador: that -3 is NOT good
[2017-02-20 01:01:39 UTC] gladefinder: boishock infinat BuddhaBar
[2017-02-20 01:02:15 UTC] eternia_forever: where could it be
[2017-02-20 01:02:34 UTC] sut1bun: Did you befriend the girl in side poppo?
[2017-02-20 01:02:36 UTC] gladefinder: there needs to be more random weird shit in this game, like a fatty in the alley wanting you to eat a subway sand off his prick
[2017-02-20 01:02:40 UTC] eternia_forever: stream died
[2017-02-20 01:02:41 UTC] slowsynchro: I would love to see Shenmue
[2017-02-20 01:03:01 UTC] capstonegaming: we gotta vote for it
[2017-02-20 01:03:12 UTC] capstonegaming: i wanna see him play crappy early 2000s games
[2017-02-20 01:03:14 UTC] yacherdy: should I get the Shenmue emulation?
[2017-02-20 01:03:17 UTC] slowsynchro: Phil playing Shenmue would be hilarious.
[2017-02-20 01:03:33 UTC] capstonegaming: i could picture him making a weird ass laugh
[2017-02-20 01:03:33 UTC] eternia_forever: hd shenmue 1 and 2 for ps4 yes
[2017-02-20 01:03:34 UTC] slowsynchro: Since the sequel is coming out sometime.
[2017-02-20 01:03:40 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: don'ty drink
[2017-02-20 01:03:45 UTC] anondublo1: shitty games and redemption runs really could save his business tbh
[2017-02-20 01:04:00 UTC] anondublo1: both would get a lot of views, especially if he played the mgs games again
[2017-02-20 01:04:47 UTC] gladefinder: well, a lot of these game styles blend into each other after a while
[2017-02-20 01:04:52 UTC] yacherdy: Japanese milf?
[2017-02-20 01:05:09 UTC] capstonegaming: he needs an orignal xbox
[2017-02-20 01:05:18 UTC] slowsynchro: Yea, I don't think he should compete with the huge AAA blockbuster games. There's too many of those on YouTube these days. Do retro games or niche games like this.
[2017-02-20 01:05:23 UTC] capstonegaming: idk if i he still has one might be holding out for capcom vs snk 2
[2017-02-20 01:05:49 UTC] capstonegaming: hed save hundreds of dollars buying older games
[2017-02-20 01:05:54 UTC] royal_phalanx91: That woman is hot
[2017-02-20 01:05:56 UTC] capstonegaming: then reviewing them for a laugh
[2017-02-20 01:05:58 UTC] eternia_forever: phil should do a playthrough of shenmue 2
[2017-02-20 01:06:07 UTC] capstonegaming: thats what his inspiration did the AVGN
[2017-02-20 01:06:10 UTC] anondublo1: yeah, the problem is his reliance on them for quick casual viewers, even though he's not in the search anymore
[2017-02-20 01:06:36 UTC] anondublo1: he should focus more on building (or rebuilding) his personality
[2017-02-20 01:06:45 UTC] capstonegaming: all he needs is a relaunch
[2017-02-20 01:06:47 UTC] slowsynchro: Yes, Shenmue 2 would be amazing.
[2017-02-20 01:06:49 UTC] gladefinder: the thing is, a popular game everyone knows and playing isn't the same as a high-rated or quality game
[2017-02-20 01:06:59 UTC] gladefinder: he could play more of the latter, even old ones
[2017-02-20 01:07:01 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I see TIHYDP videos first in search for 'dark souls 3'
[2017-02-20 01:07:06 UTC] capstonegaming: so weve decided as phils fans HE GOTTA BICYCLE
[2017-02-20 01:07:11 UTC] capstonegaming: HE GOTTA BICYCLE
[2017-02-20 01:07:15 UTC] capstonegaming: sry
[2017-02-20 01:07:31 UTC] eternia_forever: shenmue 2 is on xbox i wonder if it is playable on 360
[2017-02-20 01:07:34 UTC] capstonegaming: shenmue 2 on original xbox will be what phil streams
[2017-02-20 01:07:45 UTC] capstonegaming: MAYBE just mayve
[2017-02-20 01:07:49 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Dunno what can rehabilitate Phil's image unless he changes his entire personality
[2017-02-20 01:07:49 UTC] faisalking11: 20 min later
[2017-02-20 01:07:55 UTC] sut1bun: It's the poppo store
[2017-02-20 01:08:03 UTC] yacherdy: cahmanj
[2017-02-20 01:08:06 UTC] vince329: no that's not the video store
[2017-02-20 01:08:08 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He's made way too many mistakes and burnt too many bridges
[2017-02-20 01:08:09 UTC] shotinthedeep: maybe go to the bar?
[2017-02-20 01:08:11 UTC] vince329: that's the Dojima headquarters
[2017-02-20 01:08:29 UTC] anondublo1: at this point yeah
[2017-02-20 01:08:31 UTC] slowsynchro: Yea, I think Phil's gotta play Shenmue 1 and 2 before Shenmue 3 comes out.
[2017-02-20 01:08:37 UTC] gladefinder: well Phil's personality is his one redeaming quality and the only reason he's suffering is because other people don't get it
[2017-02-20 01:08:50 UTC] mfd4419: Hey
[2017-02-20 01:08:56 UTC] capstonegaming: he needs to focus on older games and restoriing his rep as well as practicing comedy and circumstantial hummor
[2017-02-20 01:09:15 UTC] royal_phalanx91: The name DSP is tainted honestly
[2017-02-20 01:09:19 UTC] capstonegaming: newer games are a waste of money as for honor proved
[2017-02-20 01:09:26 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He needs to change his branding entirely
[2017-02-20 01:09:33 UTC] mfd4419: Not all ture
[2017-02-20 01:09:39 UTC] anondublo1: and embracing all the shit thrown at him, like he sort of is with approved "tihydp" videos -- though he's years late there
[2017-02-20 01:09:40 UTC] sut1bun: The last business to get is the poppo store
[2017-02-20 01:09:46 UTC] vince329: i looked at a guide for the businesses honestly
[2017-02-20 01:09:46 UTC] royal_phalanx91: People know of DSP as "that asshole on the internet"
[2017-02-20 01:09:49 UTC] capstonegaming: i woudnt invest in 60$ to review
[2017-02-20 01:09:54 UTC] anondublo1: I really like the idea of redemption runs though
[2017-02-20 01:09:59 UTC] capstonegaming: id ask machinima for free review cpies i could send back
[2017-02-20 01:10:14 UTC] bethe2670: THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT GINO dspAngrydsp dspAngrydsp dspAngrydsp
[2017-02-20 01:10:17 UTC] bethe2670: oh
[2017-02-20 01:10:31 UTC] ginosaji48: want another 10 ?
[2017-02-20 01:10:34 UTC] bethe2670: FINALLY
[2017-02-20 01:10:36 UTC] gladefinder: actually one of the reasons I don't watch Phil as much (he's my favorite LPer) is due to him playing really crappy popular games
[2017-02-20 01:10:46 UTC] yacherdy: lel
[2017-02-20 01:10:48 UTC] capstonegaming: ^^^
[2017-02-20 01:10:48 UTC] gladefinder: but I would watch him more if people had him play better games
[2017-02-20 01:10:51 UTC] capstonegaming: thats the reason
[2017-02-20 01:10:52 UTC] shotinthedeep: Gino gave you a ten minute timeout?
[2017-02-20 01:10:57 UTC] bethe2670: yes
[2017-02-20 01:11:06 UTC] bethe2670: all because of mafia
[2017-02-20 01:11:07 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: what is going on bethe?
[2017-02-20 01:11:10 UTC] bethe2670: smh
[2017-02-20 01:11:11 UTC] capstonegaming: everybodys playing good games but the bad games....thats bravery especially if u invest money and time into them
[2017-02-20 01:11:13 UTC] shotinthedeep: wow dude
[2017-02-20 01:11:21 UTC] eternia_forever: hi @mfd4419
[2017-02-20 01:11:22 UTC] anondublo1: his best playthroughs are of old games/hd remakes IMO
[2017-02-20 01:11:22 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Other people playing older games like skyrim with a unique take on it (by roleplaying a specific personality) are pretty good ones
[2017-02-20 01:11:24 UTC] ginosaji48: for talking shit
[2017-02-20 01:11:42 UTC] anondublo1: yeah phalanx
[2017-02-20 01:11:44 UTC] bethe2670: all i said vito and joe arent in it
[2017-02-20 01:11:48 UTC] slowsynchro: I'd like it if Phil played more cult classic games.
[2017-02-20 01:11:52 UTC] capstonegaming: i played thru skyrim on camera twice...its okay.....but games everybody plays or has played are kinda dead
[2017-02-20 01:12:01 UTC] ginosaji48: so i see you still want another 10
[2017-02-20 01:12:05 UTC] bethe2670: no
[2017-02-20 01:12:10 UTC] mfd4419: Yrs
[2017-02-20 01:12:12 UTC] capstonegaming: i wanna see something dusty and neglected
[2017-02-20 01:12:13 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Well cant help if he even refuse to play good games (nier says hi)
[2017-02-20 01:12:15 UTC] mfd4419: Rs
[2017-02-20 01:12:24 UTC] mfd4419: Uhhh
[2017-02-20 01:12:25 UTC] royal_phalanx91: The popular youtubers (not talking about the huge ones) edit their playthroughs and post less often, dunno if Phil can even do this because those people also have regular jobs
[2017-02-20 01:12:28 UTC] shotinthedeep: How is that talking shit about mafia?
[2017-02-20 01:12:39 UTC] shotinthedeep: Guess gino is too sensitive about her precious video games
[2017-02-20 01:12:43 UTC] yacherdy: Gino is feeling edgy today Kappa
[2017-02-20 01:12:46 UTC] bethe2670: her?
[2017-02-20 01:12:48 UTC] eternia_forever: superman for atari 2600 @CapstoneGaming
[2017-02-20 01:12:54 UTC] capstonegaming: omg
[2017-02-20 01:12:54 UTC] shotinthedeep: oops
[2017-02-20 01:13:02 UTC] capstonegaming: already been done
[2017-02-20 01:13:06 UTC] slowsynchro: Some old Japanese classic games I'd like to see would be some old Squaresoft games from the PS1 era like Brave Fencer Musashi or Bushido Blade.
[2017-02-20 01:13:08 UTC] faisalking11: phil should play silent hill 1 again and get himself some views from it
[2017-02-20 01:13:12 UTC] shotinthedeep: *his
[2017-02-20 01:13:12 UTC] capstonegaming: phil has stated he took his inspiration from AVGN
[2017-02-20 01:13:17 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Sure he can post less, just make vid longer, its ad based now
[2017-02-20 01:13:22 UTC] capstonegaming: i doubt hed review or play one of those game
[2017-02-20 01:13:39 UTC] faisalking11: I know
[2017-02-20 01:13:42 UTC] anondublo1: it's hard to manage full commitment to both
[2017-02-20 01:13:50 UTC] anondublo1: being a streamer and a youtuber
[2017-02-20 01:13:53 UTC] capstonegaming: bushido blade could be cool
[2017-02-20 01:13:59 UTC] ginosaji48: i just told him that vito was in all mafia games and hes like "DUUUH he wasnt in every game, thats not true at all DUUUH" and im the bad guy ? smh
[2017-02-20 01:14:02 UTC] capstonegaming: ps1 games could work too
[2017-02-20 01:14:02 UTC] azuredragoongx1: The last time Phil made one long video, it got flack for being long xD
[2017-02-20 01:14:20 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Phil's gonna get flak whatever he does :P
[2017-02-20 01:14:24 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Besides, with Phil's vids being on average 20-30 min, how much longer should they be?
[2017-02-20 01:14:25 UTC] capstonegaming: ^
[2017-02-20 01:14:28 UTC] therealofficialstan: 4Head
[2017-02-20 01:14:32 UTC] anondublo1: so he doesn't interact with the streams, even though he does steam, and he uploads videos but he doesn't have time to edit because he streams
[2017-02-20 01:14:34 UTC] shotinthedeep: People don't like to not be able to talk
[2017-02-20 01:14:34 UTC] gladefinder: I wish he played Banjo-Tooie as it's better than the 1st one imo, it has lots of new features and concepts, and I like the world better. It's one of my favorite games while BK isn't as much
[2017-02-20 01:14:35 UTC] mfd4419: Edge lord
[2017-02-20 01:14:47 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Seen 43 minute- 1 hour lengths
[2017-02-20 01:14:57 UTC] eternia_forever: oh myyyyyyyyyy
[2017-02-20 01:14:58 UTC] azuredragoongx1: That's why I averaged it :)
[2017-02-20 01:15:13 UTC] yacherdy: gino just breathe in breathe out...think of the hot nurse...all is good.
[2017-02-20 01:15:14 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Other LPers have pretty long videos
[2017-02-20 01:15:17 UTC] azuredragoongx1: He made a 7 hr Rockband vid before, remember guys? :D
[2017-02-20 01:15:28 UTC] bethe2670: dont worry gino i was only joking
[2017-02-20 01:15:32 UTC] royal_phalanx91: One TIHYDP of Dark Souls 3 is 4 HOURS LONG
[2017-02-20 01:15:35 UTC] ginosaji48: sure
[2017-02-20 01:15:46 UTC] eternia_forever: hes a man
[2017-02-20 01:15:47 UTC] ginosaji48: as always
[2017-02-20 01:15:50 UTC] mfd4419: So much savage in chat
[2017-02-20 01:15:53 UTC] eternia_forever: a manly man
[2017-02-20 01:15:57 UTC] mfd4419: Today
[2017-02-20 01:16:04 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Just limit it to maybe 4-5 vids per day however long it is
[2017-02-20 01:16:05 UTC] eternia_forever: @AzureDragoonGX1
[2017-02-20 01:16:07 UTC] anondublo1: Kappa
[2017-02-20 01:16:08 UTC] bethe2670: i know fat guy and skinny guy probably named that is credits were vito and joe
[2017-02-20 01:16:10 UTC] anondublo1: it's a slow day
[2017-02-20 01:16:14 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Or less
[2017-02-20 01:16:16 UTC] azuredragoongx1: hm hmm
[2017-02-20 01:16:19 UTC] bethe2670: because in mafia 2 we play that mission
[2017-02-20 01:16:19 UTC] gladefinder: My biggest pet peeve is people on youtube saying Phil needs to edit his videos and change his personality. It's like, dude, unedited experience of pure Phil is why I watch this channel. Why do you want to change x, just go watch y if you don't like x. Wtf
[2017-02-20 01:16:26 UTC] capstonegaming: okay shenmue 2 is backwards compatible but its hard to find
[2017-02-20 01:16:39 UTC] gladefinder: "unedited experience of pure Phil"
[2017-02-20 01:16:51 UTC] gladefinder: SeemsGood
[2017-02-20 01:17:02 UTC] capstonegaming: 40$ used 100$ new
[2017-02-20 01:17:07 UTC] capstonegaming: so 40$
[2017-02-20 01:17:22 UTC] eternia_forever: dam i bought that day one back in 2002 wish i still had it i would give it to Phil @CapstoneGaming
[2017-02-20 01:17:39 UTC] capstonegaming: breakdown was another mediocre xbox game
[2017-02-20 01:17:39 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: there is nothing wrong with having raw material and edited stuff. It is for two different markeds right?
[2017-02-20 01:17:52 UTC] eternia_forever: i love breakdown
[2017-02-20 01:17:53 UTC] anondublo1: I think a condensed version of the parts of his streams for the day wouldn't be a terrible idea
[2017-02-20 01:18:09 UTC] damienelmaskador: Foreshadowing : he kinda did lol

[2017-02-20 01:19:20 UTC] gladefinder: some videos like that would be good for drawing people to the channel, anondublo1. but probably not good to focus on for all the people who like following the full unedited experience

[2017-02-20 01:22:18 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Cut out all the boring stuff and the videos can be condensed into the interesting moments
[2017-02-20 01:22:26 UTC] anondublo1: and I'd imagine skip through a lot of shit, like that menu cycling at the end of his last nioh stream

[2017-02-20 01:35:07 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: didn't they invent dialysis ages ago?
[2017-02-20 01:35:27 UTC] royal_phalanx91: why would losing your hand wreck your kidneys?
[2017-02-20 01:35:31 UTC] yacherdy: It's Philadelphia all over again
[2017-02-20 01:35:39 UTC] bethe2670: why is vince Kreygasm to roman reigns
[2017-02-20 01:35:49 UTC] capstonegaming: cuz of the rock
[2017-02-20 01:36:03 UTC] ginosaji48: cause reigns is new vince's golden boy
[2017-02-20 01:36:11 UTC] bethe2670: ohhhhh
[2017-02-20 01:36:12 UTC] azuredragoongx1: He lost a lot of blood, which can cause kidney injury Royal
[2017-02-20 01:36:17 UTC] capstonegaming: vince wants another rock
[2017-02-20 01:36:30 UTC] gladefinder: oh to people who have been watching this for a couple hours and don't get it, you have to read the subtitles. This game is like Zelda without the gameplay
[2017-02-20 01:36:32 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Really, the loss of fluid, but blood is the main medium of that
[2017-02-20 01:36:34 UTC] yacherdy: roman is on the same level as the rahk
[2017-02-20 01:36:36 UTC] bethe2670: roman will never be tha rock
[2017-02-20 01:36:41 UTC] capstonegaming: which roman reigns could be a big draw if he plays to the razor ramon hearthrob gimmick
[2017-02-20 01:36:46 UTC] damienelmaskador: runaway, nowhere to hide but caverns, dialysis... Tachibana is Bin Laden, man!!! XD
[2017-02-20 01:36:53 UTC] capstonegaming: every time roman comes out you here the ladies woooo but the guys boo
[2017-02-20 01:37:06 UTC] bethe2670: capstone like cena

[2017-02-20 01:37:30 UTC] eternia_forever: cheer10
[2017-02-20 01:37:35 UTC] azuredragoongx1: I'd kill for a work ethic like Cena's, being able to mix things up even in a near-retiring age
[2017-02-20 01:37:48 UTC] azuredragoongx1: That's at least one thing you can like about him
[2017-02-20 01:37:48 UTC] capstonegaming: cena is a damn OP suerman
[2017-02-20 01:37:56 UTC] masternutella: Do a lot of chinese people live in japan?
[2017-02-20 01:37:57 UTC] capstonegaming: thats why cena sucks superman is OP
[2017-02-20 01:38:06 UTC] gladefinder: that would be hilarious if they changed the subtitles/story completely, and it's nothing the same happening at all in the Japan version
[2017-02-20 01:38:29 UTC] bethe2670: he has to mix things up cause once he retires BAM hollywood or tv shows
[2017-02-20 01:38:32 UTC] capstonegaming: cena needs a nancy kerrigan angle where somebody shatters his kneecap backstage
[2017-02-20 01:38:40 UTC] capstonegaming: with a crowbar
[2017-02-20 01:38:43 UTC] damienelmaskador: kinda
[2017-02-20 01:38:48 UTC] azuredragoongx1: He didn't have to; The Rock and Hogan didn't

[2017-02-20 01:43:07 UTC] azuredragoongx1: It's worth a play or two
[2017-02-20 01:43:13 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: I recently got sleeping dogs on ps4 for £3.99 on sale on psn
[2017-02-20 01:43:13 UTC] bethe2670: vidar but is it more than a metal gear solid game :D

[2017-02-20 01:44:53 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Also, grabbing a person near a wall glitch, causing you both to be launched fatally in the air
[2017-02-20 01:45:20 UTC] capstonegaming: just go to america and be kung fu action star

[2017-02-20 01:46:24 UTC] ginosaji48: yea i was running up to enemy who was close to wall, it was supposed to be a take down, but enemy died and i was launched in the air
[2017-02-20 01:47:00 UTC] ginosaji48: that was before most of the stuff was fixed
[2017-02-20 01:47:07 UTC] bethe2670: i did get a funny glitch where a body was just spinning in a circle in sleeping dogs i was like what the fuck :D
[2017-02-20 01:47:14 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Many unlockable moves were useless too because most of the later enemies will counter it
[2017-02-20 01:47:22 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Which is depressing; why bother getting them?
[2017-02-20 01:47:33 UTC] ginosaji48: to look cool Kappa

[2017-02-20 01:48:14 UTC] azuredragoongx1: The useless Dim Mak too
[2017-02-20 01:48:21 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Even Dirty Ming could avoid that
[2017-02-20 01:48:29 UTC] capstonegaming: oo its day time
[2017-02-20 01:48:47 UTC] azuredragoongx1: The ultimate move in the game -> Stopped by 3rd mission boss
[2017-02-20 01:48:48 UTC] capstonegaming: does it turn day time?
[2017-02-20 01:48:52 UTC] ginosaji48: i spent a lot of time in sleeping dogs doing one or two moves over and over
[2017-02-20 01:48:54 UTC] capstonegaming: or is this special new level
[2017-02-20 01:48:54 UTC] azuredragoongx1: United Front Games, WTF?

[2017-02-20 01:51:39 UTC] azuredragoongx1: But it's a matter of if Phil will get to it
[2017-02-20 01:51:49 UTC] capstonegaming: the phone
[2017-02-20 01:51:53 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Remember that Phil did quite a bit in 5, and only got 27% or so xD
[2017-02-20 01:51:53 UTC] gladefinder: hey Phil, Phil hey you listening, Phil, Phil check this out, look at this Phil, you there? Phil? Phil, Phil Phil.

[2017-02-20 01:52:32 UTC] somone192: How far is he in real estate?

[2017-02-20 19:52:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it's hilarious,the dude that owns the channel interviews the fans after games and the guys are the most OTT, sensationalist , crazy group of people. Gary Neville had an interview with em.

[2017-02-20 19:55:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: most of the steam reviews were saying the same as Phil about the P2P. Atm it has a 61% approval rating
[2017-02-20 19:56:06 UTC] shotinthedeep: we won't see one of you for a week
[2017-02-20 19:56:31 UTC] bethe2670: i'd probably be here and never hear the end of it from jimbob or gino
[2017-02-20 19:56:50 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bethe you have me confused with someone else
[2017-02-20 19:56:51 UTC] shotinthedeep: :D That's true

[2017-02-20 19:58:05 UTC] shotinthedeep: ...but guess I'm gonna have to root for chelsea
[2017-02-20 19:58:10 UTC] ginosaji48: screw chelsea
[2017-02-20 19:58:21 UTC] bethe2670: NotLikeThis
[2017-02-20 19:58:28 UTC] shotinthedeep: Gino do you not like chelsea, or just doing it cause bethe likes chelsea?
[2017-02-20 19:58:40 UTC] bethe2670: the second one probably
[2017-02-20 19:58:45 UTC] ginosaji48: i dont like them
[2017-02-20 19:58:53 UTC] spade137: Once again weeb games dominate the patron's choice poll Kappa
[2017-02-20 19:59:01 UTC] bethe2670: what has chelsea EVER done to you
[2017-02-20 19:59:11 UTC] darksydephil: aw man, a patron is upset :(
[2017-02-20 19:59:32 UTC] shotinthedeep: Oh really? Traditionalgames again?
[2017-02-20 19:59:39 UTC] theycallmejimbob: can't win em all I guess
[2017-02-20 19:59:43 UTC] yacherdy: My first dog ever was named Chelsea. She died. :(
[2017-02-20 19:59:49 UTC] bethe2670: the patreons choice is going to be either Jak, Crash or assassins creed top 3
[2017-02-20 19:59:49 UTC] darksydephil: they didn't understand how the patrons choice nominations/poll would work, i guess they nominated a game they really wanted to see me play and thought it would make it to the poll no matter what. in this case, the only games that made it to the final poll got 2 or more nominations
[2017-02-20 19:59:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: after Chelsea Clinton YaCherdy?
[2017-02-20 20:00:00 UTC] shotinthedeep: That's sad yacherdy :(
[2017-02-20 20:00:14 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob Maybe Kappa
[2017-02-20 20:00:15 UTC] bethe2670: poor yacherdy
[2017-02-20 20:00:20 UTC] yacherdy: @shotinthedeep I know :(
[2017-02-20 20:00:21 UTC] darksydephil: its my fault, i should have explained the entire process, i just kind of assume that everyone "gets it" because ive done these polls in the past
[2017-02-20 20:00:26 UTC] darksydephil: i apologized to the guy
[2017-02-20 20:01:04 UTC] spade137: Phil i want to tell you something but im afraid you are going to reset the poll xD
[2017-02-20 20:01:11 UTC] shotinthedeep: That's nice of you
[2017-02-20 20:01:14 UTC] bethe2670: huh
[2017-02-20 20:01:22 UTC] darksydephil: well it was my fault, its the least i could do
[2017-02-20 20:02:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: but even if it did get through to the poll there is no guarantees it would win either.So he'd probably be upset over that too.
[2017-02-20 20:02:40 UTC] darksydephil: maybe. i think he just wanted to see his suggested game get a chance to be picked
[2017-02-20 20:02:48 UTC] bethe2670: crash prob wont win because of the n'sane trilogy thing
[2017-02-20 20:03:01 UTC] bethe2670: so it would prob be out of ass creed or jak
[2017-02-20 20:03:02 UTC] darksydephil: i totally get where hes coming from, these last few months ive had a LOT of new patrons and i kind of just assume they understand the whole process
[2017-02-20 20:03:21 UTC] spade137: bethe danga is winning Kappa
[2017-02-20 20:03:26 UTC] bethe2670: lol

[2017-02-20 20:03:27 UTC] spade137: pls stay that way
[2017-02-20 20:03:39 UTC] theycallmejimbob: isn't that a visual novel or something spade137?
[2017-02-20 20:03:49 UTC] spade137: kinda its like ace attorney
[2017-02-20 20:03:55 UTC] spade137: but weeb version
[2017-02-20 20:04:03 UTC] darksydephil: well this sure shows how ive grown as a person
[2017-02-20 20:04:07 UTC] bethe2670: oh no not another ace attorney
[2017-02-20 20:04:20 UTC] darksydephil: if this were 2008-2012 Phil, I probably would have responded to the guy defensively saying i did nothing wrong, so tough shit lol
[2017-02-20 20:04:25 UTC] spade137: its voice acted so not that bad
[2017-02-20 20:04:35 UTC] bethe2670: but still
[2017-02-20 20:04:42 UTC] shotinthedeep: Yeah, I guess. You haven't done a patrons playthrough since last year. I think it shows a lot that you apologized to him
[2017-02-20 20:04:48 UTC] mto2089: some rly good choices phil to pick from
[2017-02-20 20:04:52 UTC] mto2089: danganronpa, jak 3, crash 3

[2017-02-20 20:05:13 UTC] darksydephil: if it wins im being told i should wait until march 17 to start as theres a PS4 remaster being released
[2017-02-20 20:05:18 UTC] mto2089: going to be tough to find time with horizon, mass effect, dark souls 3 DLC
[2017-02-20 20:05:27 UTC] ginosaji48: from the name i assume it will be crap bethe
[2017-02-20 20:05:31 UTC] mto2089: its like ace attorney but with more craziness over the top anime clique lol

[2017-02-20 20:06:47 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Main story of danga is 24 hrs long according to HLTB
[2017-02-20 20:07:06 UTC] spade137: well that depends is phil going to voice act the no voice acted part?
[2017-02-20 20:07:07 UTC] bethe2670: i just imagine gino in hospital leg up in the air on a sling, typing on his phone with his wife next to him and random doctors and nurses
[2017-02-20 20:07:13 UTC] bethe2670: who gino
[2017-02-20 20:07:15 UTC] spade137: if he is then yeah its gonna be long
[2017-02-20 20:07:17 UTC] yacherdy: Games should at least be 70 hours Kappa
[2017-02-20 20:07:23 UTC] mto2089: theres side content like additional dialogue of building a relationship with a character ala persona

[2017-02-20 20:08:21 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob Yeah main stories should be 70 hours and extras should extend to maybe 100 hours Kappa
[2017-02-20 20:08:32 UTC] yacherdy: Anything less is a rip off
