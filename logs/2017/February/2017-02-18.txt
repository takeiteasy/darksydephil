[2017-02-18 19:49:07 UTC] yacherdy: He's running out of time
[2017-02-18 19:49:08 UTC] riouinsuiko: I wanted to see him try a twilight mission, but being that they will always be repeats, I dunno if he will.

[2017-02-18 19:51:13 UTC] riouinsuiko: that's a logical disconnect
[2017-02-18 19:51:27 UTC] riouinsuiko: an 'american' is someone who supports and lives by traditional american values
[2017-02-18 19:51:32 UTC] riouinsuiko: got nothing to do with race
[2017-02-18 19:51:39 UTC] podusmonens: oh, values..yeah that's true

[2017-02-18 19:53:57 UTC] riouinsuiko: DansGame
[2017-02-18 19:54:11 UTC] darksydephil: might have to check that out today, it appraently breaks the game and people are saying they're going to patch it out lol
[2017-02-18 19:54:20 UTC] mrviews: what colour u like phil?
[2017-02-18 19:54:28 UTC] darksydephil: purple polka dot

[2017-02-18 19:54:41 UTC] yacherdy: Kreygasm
[2017-02-18 19:54:44 UTC] darksydephil: i think its called sloth or sluggish or something like that riouinsuiko
[2017-02-18 19:54:57 UTC] bethe2670: phil you got 7 main missions left and all the side missions in between in case you missed my tweet
[2017-02-18 19:54:58 UTC] darksydephil: it appraently slows down time, but you remain moving at full speed. it destroys bosses if you can do enough damage
[2017-02-18 19:54:58 UTC] riouinsuiko: Oh yeah, it's the same effect the spiders put on you
[2017-02-18 19:55:13 UTC] riouinsuiko: oh, actually, I'm thinking of something else
[2017-02-18 19:55:18 UTC] darksydephil: i guess a LOT of people are using that ability
[2017-02-18 19:55:42 UTC] mrviews: why dont u play sniper elite 4 phil?
[2017-02-18 19:55:56 UTC] bethe2670: sniper elite 4 is a great game but
[2017-02-18 19:55:59 UTC] bethe2670: anyway
[2017-02-18 19:56:04 UTC] riouinsuiko: Well obviously you decide what you want to do, but imo it will be disappointing if it completely cheeses any challenge for the rest of the game for you :p
[2017-02-18 19:56:42 UTC] kingjadvcmp: was watching some Sniper Elite 4 on YouTube earlier today, it did look pretty fun - some gruesome kills if you got the skills
[2017-02-18 19:56:58 UTC] mrviews: no skill needed for se 4
[2017-02-18 19:56:58 UTC] podusmonens: it ain't easy being cheesy riouin

[2017-02-18 19:59:01 UTC] bethe2670: Chelsea won yet again Quarter Finals of the FA Cup here we come
[2017-02-18 19:59:03 UTC] kingjadvcmp: will these videos be uploaded 1080p or 720p on YouTube? I'm not sure if Phil can stream at one rate but capture on another, I understand there is software that allows that

[2017-02-18 20:36:10 UTC] xgameofpwns: @blue_blur64 well duh if he want's to stream longer he'll have less time for other things
[2017-02-18 20:36:21 UTC] stillbus: @mynameismrrobot YES
[2017-02-18 20:36:38 UTC] blue_blur64: No, by streaming earlier, he won't lose time with editing
[2017-02-18 20:36:51 UTC] deltaforce355: also the year of TIHYDP created yacherdy
[2017-02-18 20:36:56 UTC] blue_blur64: He wants more time for both editing and gameplay
[2017-02-18 20:37:04 UTC] doctoroffizz: The problem is not "I'm too busy" but it's "I need to follow a schedule".

[2017-02-18 20:37:10 UTC] faisalking11: phil really should do pranks
[2017-02-18 20:37:14 UTC] yacherdy: @DeltaForce355 true, i think it was mid 2013 when that happened

[2017-02-18 20:37:28 UTC] stillbus: I though the announcement would be that @yacherdy officially becomes a mod
[2017-02-18 20:37:29 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: well if phil takes a day of every week I don't think that would be so weird really
[2017-02-18 20:37:34 UTC] doctoroffizz: What other streamer follows a schedule as strictly as Phil?

[2017-02-18 21:02:03 UTC] xgameofpwns: C'mon the devs definitely intended sloth to be a pvp item
[2017-02-18 21:02:04 UTC] akioartorius: spade, every one messaged about stances. Phil replied mid stance is op what isn't broke don't fix

[2017-02-18 21:02:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: people did spade137 and his response on twitter was "but I haven't hit a situation where I need either stance yet, rendering them effectively useless. Mid stance beats everything, lol"
