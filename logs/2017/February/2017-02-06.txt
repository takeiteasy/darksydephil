[2017-02-06 19:23:42 UTC] kingjadvcmp: he would readily admit he associates with detractors a lot, I'm certain. And he does not like me because 1) I'm a detractor myself really (but I behave myself in here, as I'm sure you can agree) and 2) I call out his hypocrisy.
[2017-02-06 19:27:10 UTC] bethe2670: you behave until vidar comes lol
