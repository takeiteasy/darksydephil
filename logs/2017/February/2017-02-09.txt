[2017-02-09 00:01:45 UTC] ands_: The Demon Wall is dead because you completed the stage.

[2017-02-09 19:49:44 UTC] ginosaji48: maybe he should do some song like he did for cena
[2017-02-09 19:49:49 UTC] ginosaji48: and no
[2017-02-09 19:49:56 UTC] bethe2670: that would be funny
[2017-02-09 19:50:13 UTC] ginosaji48: or actually some real fight would be cool
[2017-02-09 19:50:25 UTC] bethe2670: but who would he do the song on
[2017-02-09 19:50:41 UTC] bethe2670: an actual match would be good yep
[2017-02-09 19:50:54 UTC] ginosaji48: maybe on reigns so he can finally turn heel
[2017-02-09 19:51:15 UTC] bethe2670: fuck roman reigns and why would the rock do it on him
[2017-02-09 19:51:25 UTC] bethe2670: he is faaaaamily
[2017-02-09 19:51:55 UTC] ginosaji48: well Usos were family to him too, look what happened now
[2017-02-09 19:52:14 UTC] bethe2670: they still family to him though
[2017-02-09 19:52:21 UTC] bethe2670: i know they heel but stil
[2017-02-09 19:53:04 UTC] ginosaji48: and rollins will be on wm33 against tripple h so wonder what was the point of the injury
[2017-02-09 19:53:16 UTC] 0megaj0ker: wtf is happening in this chat? :D
[2017-02-09 19:54:48 UTC] bethe2670: wrestling talk
[2017-02-09 19:55:02 UTC] bethe2670: and rollins was injured by joe not his fault
[2017-02-09 19:55:15 UTC] bethe2670: and of course he will fight triple h
[2017-02-09 19:56:11 UTC] ginosaji48: im sure cripple will burry rollins at wm33, by himself or with help of joe, thats why they're saying they have big plans for joe
[2017-02-09 19:56:19 UTC] bethe2670: i think what wwe really wanted was joe vs rollins at fastlane then triple h vs rollins at mania but joe injured rollins so cant do that now
[2017-02-09 19:57:09 UTC] bethe2670: triple h probably will bury him
[2017-02-09 19:58:49 UTC] ginosaji48: same for sting, he should win at wm31, then lose to seth, but nope they had to make jobber out of him, im worried seth will end this way too
[2017-02-09 19:59:16 UTC] bethe2670: seth wont be a jobber
[2017-02-09 19:59:22 UTC] bethe2670: he isnt old like sting
[2017-02-09 19:59:31 UTC] bethe2670: he is SETH FREAKIN ROLLINS
[2017-02-09 19:59:54 UTC] bethe2670: THE ARCHITECT
[2017-02-09 20:00:00 UTC] ginosaji48: but still, tripple h had nothing to lose so they could let sting win
[2017-02-09 20:00:20 UTC] bethe2670: i know sting could of won but he didnt
[2017-02-09 20:00:38 UTC] ginosaji48: cause of bad scripting, good job wwe
[2017-02-09 20:00:43 UTC] bethe2670: and then he got fucked up by accident by rollins

[2017-02-09 20:16:00 UTC] alex_dragonul: There is a lot of snow here but it stopped snowing now the very cold temp will come , it may turn the snow into ice
[2017-02-09 20:16:04 UTC] snowstormx30: This boss had me in rage he is so fast and spams slice attack
[2017-02-09 20:16:25 UTC] bethe2670: hmm so gino has a snake dick seems legit
[2017-02-09 20:16:26 UTC] akioartorius: random thought, if gino keeps punching bethe wouldn't bethe become resistant to it?

[2017-02-09 20:18:06 UTC] darksydephil: theres also something wrong with sub notifications, as its obvious nobody on KOGaming is being told im uploading new videos
[2017-02-09 20:18:11 UTC] akioartorius: @bethe2670 , so you are saying phil's got this in the bag
[2017-02-09 20:18:16 UTC] darksydephil: sorry but 3 days and only 3k views on the injustice 2 vid is bullshit
[2017-02-09 20:18:26 UTC] snowstormx30: i predict alot of range unless the easy theory is true. this boss made me its bitch but its optional Phil might skip it.
[2017-02-09 20:18:27 UTC] klonnikia10297: theres new vids up? .-.
[2017-02-09 20:18:30 UTC] renaofnight: it has something to do with the bell icon, dsp. some creators bring it up sometimes
[2017-02-09 20:18:34 UTC] darksydephil: and the Nioh vid had 2k views when i went to sleep, woke up 6+ hours later, same views lol
[2017-02-09 20:18:42 UTC] akioartorius: I think everyone on yt is affected by the sub view thing
[2017-02-09 20:18:45 UTC] thedoctor5437: since Nioh actually has a map I would consider buying it, as long as it stays as easy as phil is experiencing
[2017-02-09 20:18:49 UTC] bethe2670: akio it might get harder later for phil BUT he did get a update right now
[2017-02-09 20:19:05 UTC] bobbi_ling: doctor you casual!

[2017-02-09 21:36:35 UTC] bammbino: @duderito2, castlemark is the main example from FF15 -- people told him where to find it and that theres a good weapon. he then got super lost with the puzzle and needed help

[2017-02-09 21:38:57 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well bammbino I think it's a bit fucked up your logic here. You wait for Phil to play a game, in order to help him through it as fast as possible, rather than have him enjoy it from a gamer's perspective of playing it themselves (even if sharing with others on stream)
[2017-02-09 21:38:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Gino is still getting used to twitch controls
[2017-02-09 21:38:58 UTC] bammbino: @duderito2, yes thats why i asked people to not spoil the tachi fight and asked chat 17 deaths in if we should tell him about the rock

[2017-02-09 21:41:48 UTC] kingjadvcmp: this is quite mad, Bammbino, you'd rather hold Phil's hand through a game than let him learn how to master it? I guess you're thinking from a business perspective, wanting him to finish games as fast as possible?
[2017-02-09 21:41:49 UTC] xgameofpwns: ...then it gets tough

[2017-02-09 21:42:29 UTC] stuart360: His old playthroughs were much better before he started streaming. There is less failing, raging, salt and Phil bumbling about now since he started streaming. I mean yeah you still get all that, but not as much as before, and some playthrough have been destroyed by certain tips (like special weapons etc)

[2017-02-09 22:09:03 UTC] taurusoxford: yes
[2017-02-09 22:09:04 UTC] ginosaji48: yea
[2017-02-09 22:09:06 UTC] hapticbabyman: But competitively, a good fighter has a long shelf life. 3S had a ridiculously long shelf life. I'm guessing Tekken 7 will too. SFV does but a lot of that has been b/c of SFIV and Capcom money tbh
[2017-02-09 22:09:07 UTC] yacherdy: YOU DIDN'T WASH YO HANDS
[2017-02-09 22:09:09 UTC] lvlpower: yes
[2017-02-09 22:09:15 UTC] babymangaming: @HeggemBeast if you have a life then live it. Instead of shiting on guy over the internet.. you don't personally know

[2017-02-09 22:11:04 UTC] ands_: I beat it in one shot, by running like a lil bitch and using two of those heal all health purple potions. Then the game decides that you get to keep going in the mission. Good times.
[2017-02-09 22:11:05 UTC] ginosaji48: YOU MISSED THE CHEST

[2017-02-09 22:11:57 UTC] bammbino: @Ands_, i died once but i quilcky realized that counting 1,2,3,4 makes the fight easy(counting his strikes then attack)
[2017-02-09 22:11:57 UTC] naddodr: Your van's about to explode Phil
[2017-02-09 22:11:58 UTC] stillbus: can I chat with you @sonsofkojima1 in your chat?

[2017-02-09 22:12:30 UTC] yacherdy: thanks
[2017-02-09 22:12:32 UTC] bammbino: @Ands_, they say lv100+ for me and that the game needs be in twilight mode for it to work
[2017-02-09 22:12:35 UTC] heggembeast: @babymangaming how am i hating excactly?
[2017-02-09 22:12:44 UTC] hapticbabyman: so basically, this game is: Easy Stages - Hard Bosses? I can respect that. Not like Dark Souls but it's a bit old-school in that way and that could be neat. But some people probably don't like "difficulty spikes".
[2017-02-09 22:12:49 UTC] tedicotuckz: Believe me, baby man, heggern is no troll

[2017-02-09 22:13:19 UTC] ands_: 1080P/60FPS is fine with me.
[2017-02-09 22:13:21 UTC] neuroblack77: @hapticbabyman Mostly true though some bosses can be pushovers if you have the right items.

[2017-02-09 22:13:51 UTC] neuroblack77: Wheelmonk, you mean.
[2017-02-09 22:13:54 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Neuroblack77 Yeah, there's been a couple of those early on before he got to Tachibana actually

[2017-02-09 22:45:13 UTC] neuroblack77: Doing the side missions trivializes some of the missions. It's best to avoid them unless you really hit a wall.
[2017-02-09 22:45:24 UTC] bethe2670: YaCHADy
[2017-02-09 22:45:27 UTC] chaosalltheway: did he killed munashige?
[2017-02-09 22:45:31 UTC] yacherdy: No one likes a Chad :(
[2017-02-09 22:45:37 UTC] neuroblack77: Yes he did.

[2017-02-09 22:45:53 UTC] akioartorius: yes Phil beat Tachibana Munashige after 25 deaths
[2017-02-09 22:45:55 UTC] ubska: seems like a glitch, hes always finding glitches!! omfg
[2017-02-09 22:46:04 UTC] yacherdy: YaCherdy comes from the dumbest thing I could think of on purpose...Chad + Nerdy...Cherdy.

[2017-02-09 22:46:50 UTC] bethe2670: geez
[2017-02-09 22:46:55 UTC] akioartorius: the poison is back
[2017-02-09 22:46:58 UTC] motok0kusanagi: the main thing they took away in the alpha was durability
[2017-02-09 22:47:01 UTC] ubska: DSP - Would you consider a no death replay of the game for a Patreon event??
[2017-02-09 22:47:04 UTC] motok0kusanagi: which i guess makes it more difficult?
[2017-02-09 22:47:04 UTC] yacherdy: oh
[2017-02-09 22:47:05 UTC] babymangaming: i like him when he rages a bit
[2017-02-09 22:47:05 UTC] fugfknmugly: Nothing Phil could do
[2017-02-09 22:47:15 UTC] neuroblack77: No, they also tweaked the ki depletion.
[2017-02-09 22:47:16 UTC] kinggoken: dspNothing
[2017-02-09 22:47:22 UTC] motok0kusanagi: i mean there are some things that are easier, but not that much
[2017-02-09 22:47:29 UTC] neuroblack77: Now you have to have your guard broken to be stunned.
[2017-02-09 22:47:34 UTC] motok0kusanagi: true
[2017-02-09 22:47:42 UTC] motok0kusanagi: that kind of makes sense though
[2017-02-09 22:47:43 UTC] ands_: He's been in mid stance the entire time?
[2017-02-09 22:47:46 UTC] chaosalltheway: these guys are so predictable now lul
[2017-02-09 22:47:48 UTC] akioartorius: yes
[2017-02-09 22:47:49 UTC] ubska: Phil is really good at this game!
[2017-02-09 22:47:50 UTC] babymangaming: i like him better when hes angry at the gaem for being bullshit/
[2017-02-09 22:47:51 UTC] marktactics: Game being easier doesn't mean it's easy
[2017-02-09 22:48:00 UTC] akioartorius: Phil needs to use the other stances more
[2017-02-09 22:48:00 UTC] neuroblack77: Most of the time it does but in some cases, bosses hit you when they have no ki left.
[2017-02-09 22:48:17 UTC] ands_: Just go to the boss!
[2017-02-09 22:48:20 UTC] ands_: You're there.
[2017-02-09 22:48:37 UTC] motok0kusanagi: some bosses can just break out of stunlock like Lightning Tiger that has that instant lightning bolt
[2017-02-09 22:48:46 UTC] babymangaming: phil, if you are a Cult I'am your follower.
[2017-02-09 22:48:56 UTC] motok0kusanagi: tdogRat
[2017-02-09 22:49:00 UTC] ands_: Jump you wuss.
[2017-02-09 22:49:06 UTC] ubska: Just shared this on my Twitter Phil
[2017-02-09 22:49:12 UTC] neuroblack77: I don't mean stunlock. For a later boss, I recorded my fight and he hits me when his ki bar is empty and red.
[2017-02-09 22:49:21 UTC] motok0kusanagi: right
[2017-02-09 22:49:23 UTC] motok0kusanagi: that can happen
[2017-02-09 22:49:24 UTC] neuroblack77: I still ended up winning but it bugs me a bit.
[2017-02-09 22:50:05 UTC] motok0kusanagi: having no ki doesn't prevent bosses from attacking though
[2017-02-09 22:50:17 UTC] bethe2670: SUCK IT
[2017-02-09 22:50:19 UTC] motok0kusanagi: all it does is make them susceptible to stagger

[2017-02-09 22:50:44 UTC] akioartorius: stuck in a wall
[2017-02-09 22:50:48 UTC] yacherdy: bethe is a male porn star named Keiran Lee from Derby
[2017-02-09 22:50:59 UTC] akioartorius: the fuk?
[2017-02-09 22:51:00 UTC] neuroblack77: In this current build, that's true. BUt, I thought that in the alpha, no ki universally meant that no attacks would be possible.
[2017-02-09 22:51:14 UTC] motok0kusanagi: i didn't play the first iteration, i only played the second demo before release
[2017-02-09 22:51:20 UTC] neuroblack77: Ah, I see.
[2017-02-09 22:51:21 UTC] yacherdy: @akioartorius I know, I couldn't believe it etiher

[2017-02-09 22:52:34 UTC] yacherdy: big fan of your scenes
[2017-02-09 22:52:37 UTC] neuroblack77: Yeah. I'm glad the loading times are not too bad as they were for Bloodborne at launch.
[2017-02-09 22:52:43 UTC] motok0kusanagi: it gets better over time @DoctorZzZ
[2017-02-09 22:53:02 UTC] motok0kusanagi: @Neuroblack77, those were awful

[2017-02-09 22:59:19 UTC] motok0kusanagi: @Marpat1993, thats probably my biggest complaint with the game is the limited music
[2017-02-09 22:59:26 UTC] motok0kusanagi: there's a few good unique tracks, but not many
[2017-02-09 22:59:28 UTC] splitplaythru: Find one of the holes and drop down to find a secret area...
