[2017-02-10 19:24:16 UTC] diamond19800: why do you ask?
[2017-02-10 19:25:02 UTC] sanguinenite: Because it is really late where I am at which is why I am ultra early, just wondering if there were any overseas viewers other than myself
[2017-02-10 19:26:09 UTC] diamond19800: it's 10.00 PM where i'm

[2017-02-10 19:35:36 UTC] diamond19800: The Kappa is a meme among Twitch users (and now it seems other places.) The meme has become a sort of patron saint of light hearted trolling among the gaming community. Users typing Kappa into Twitch chat see a special emoticon featuring a smug looking human face.
[2017-02-10 19:36:43 UTC] sanguinenite: since you are KSA, I am guessing you believe in the dominant religion there?

[2017-02-10 19:47:20 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bethe I heard a story today there is a lack of male strippers in London and they're advertising for em maybe a career change for you?
[2017-02-10 19:47:24 UTC] bethe2670: the resident evil 7 montage was super funny too :D
[2017-02-10 19:47:42 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob no thanks lol
[2017-02-10 19:51:26 UTC] bethe2670: how do you know that there are male strippers needed jimbob? you gay?
[2017-02-10 19:51:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: there was a news story today bethe2670 saying that some company was advertising to em
[2017-02-10 19:52:03 UTC] theycallmejimbob: for*
[2017-02-10 19:52:08 UTC] bethe2670: well i never heard nothing

[2017-02-10 19:53:09 UTC] bethe2670: that tweet was funny phil
[2017-02-10 19:53:15 UTC] bethe2670: !twitter
[2017-02-10 19:53:15 UTC] nightbot: Follow me on Twitter! http://www.twitter.com/theycallmedsp
[2017-02-10 19:56:19 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: what did he mean about politics
[2017-02-10 19:56:33 UTC] elipsion: Yo Phil use your item drops for crafting materials you will find it useful later
[2017-02-10 19:56:36 UTC] elipsion: For making item sets
[2017-02-10 19:56:43 UTC] theycallmejimbob: twitter is having its daily meltdown over something Trump did/said probably
[2017-02-10 19:57:26 UTC] darksydephil: should i be breaking down the weapons at the blacksmith?
[2017-02-10 19:57:43 UTC] bethe2670: you could and see what happens
[2017-02-10 19:57:45 UTC] darksydephil: wtf chat crashed
[2017-02-10 19:57:45 UTC] darksydephil: sign
[2017-02-10 19:57:50 UTC] bethe2670: only way to find out
[2017-02-10 19:57:55 UTC] elipsion: Yes expecially the purple items
[2017-02-10 19:57:59 UTC] darksydephil: ok back
[2017-02-10 19:58:10 UTC] darksydephil: so dont keep offering stuff to the shrine, instead break down weapons at the blacksmith?
[2017-02-10 19:58:23 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: better figure out for yourself, Phil
[2017-02-10 19:58:26 UTC] darksydephil: i havent done that bc it seems you just find so much f'ing loot i assumed it'd be better than what you can forge anyway
[2017-02-10 19:58:53 UTC] bethe2670: dspHmm
[2017-02-10 19:59:00 UTC] elipsion: Forging is good to make set gear because its hard to find all of them through drops
[2017-02-10 19:59:11 UTC] elipsion: and they are more powerful together than random armor
[2017-02-10 19:59:17 UTC] darksydephil: ok, i had noi dea you could craft set gear
[2017-02-10 19:59:56 UTC] darksydephil: it seems offering stuff up has worked well as i always have full elixirs
[2017-02-10 20:00:45 UTC] elipsion: You could offer yellows and whites to shrine for exilers, and leave blue and purple for better crafting materials
[2017-02-10 20:00:48 UTC] bethe2670: offering is good for elixers obviously
[2017-02-10 20:01:06 UTC] darksydephil: ok ill give it a shot
[2017-02-10 20:01:21 UTC] bethe2670: blue and purple are good and yellow and white are poop
[2017-02-10 20:01:23 UTC] bethe2670: :D
[2017-02-10 20:02:56 UTC] riouinsuiko: Selling or disassembling items that you have high familiarity with is better than disassembling them. So if you replace a weapon you have been using you are better off trading it in
[2017-02-10 20:03:10 UTC] riouinsuiko: rather than scrapping it for parts since familiarity increases value but not materials
[2017-02-10 20:03:29 UTC] darksydephil: so high familiarity items sell fo rmoney
[2017-02-10 20:03:32 UTC] darksydephil: other items break down
[2017-02-10 20:03:37 UTC] darksydephil: and the crappiest items offer up to the shrines
[2017-02-10 20:04:24 UTC] elipsion: Yeah, although if you soul match items with highest familiarity sometimes you can transfer its skills
[2017-02-10 20:04:27 UTC] elipsion: to your new weapon
[2017-02-10 20:04:28 UTC] riouinsuiko: Should be the way to go, but in my experience so far super micro management isn't necessary to succeed so it goes either way
[2017-02-10 20:04:55 UTC] darksydephil: yeah i havent seen any skill transfers yet in soul match, but i was hoping there would be
[2017-02-10 20:05:26 UTC] the_joshua_slayer: What is he playing today?
[2017-02-10 20:06:04 UTC] bethe2670: its LIVE
[2017-02-10 20:06:08 UTC] bethe2670: hey pepsicola
[2017-02-10 20:06:11 UTC] popsicolo: HeyGuys
[2017-02-10 20:06:37 UTC] riouinsuiko: Also, Phil, worth considering: Those summoner candle items can save you in a pinch. If you stumble into a boss accidentally you can use one to recover your spirit and all amrita
[2017-02-10 20:06:46 UTC] riouinsuiko: versus running back and risking dying if you have a lot
[2017-02-10 20:07:20 UTC] riouinsuiko: It took me forever to figure out what they actually did.. some of the descriptions are just lame lol
[2017-02-10 20:07:41 UTC] darksydephil: so summoner candles get you out of a pickle, gotcha
[2017-02-10 20:08:01 UTC] riouinsuiko: only if you die, it just recovers your blood stain effectively
[2017-02-10 20:09:12 UTC] bethe2670: @theycallmejimbob ? @Ginosaji48 ? who are they?
[2017-02-10 20:09:16 UTC] soulrider95: Ordered myself a PS4 pro this morning Kreygasm

[2017-02-10 20:12:10 UTC] marpat1993: Hello you sexy beasts
[2017-02-10 20:12:10 UTC] darksydephil: gotta LOVE the dumbfuck reactions to the new KOGaming montage i released last night. hundreds of thumbs down with the best criticisms being "it's too blurry" and "these jokes aren't pertinent" and "it's too short" lol
[2017-02-10 20:12:11 UTC] riouinsuiko: If you run around the rock on the west side you can cheese him into doing specials and just poke him once
[2017-02-10 20:12:19 UTC] riouinsuiko: it's really easy to do once you figure it out lol
[2017-02-10 20:12:22 UTC] soulrider95: gonna get Bloodborne, Persona 5, maybe The Last Guardian
[2017-02-10 20:12:24 UTC] darksydephil: when you're grasping at fucking straws to criticize something, time to realize you're a moron

[2017-02-10 20:13:20 UTC] phillymann: It's just excuses after excuses with them. You'll never make them happy so don't dwell on them
[2017-02-10 20:13:22 UTC] darksydephil: but jealous kids who have made awful *** vids for years are so insanely jealous that it got featured, they literally have to nitpick

[2017-02-10 20:14:05 UTC] riouinsuiko: You know though, honestly Phil, the main game of those people is just to rile you up. That's not to say you can't or shouldn't be annoyed by it
[2017-02-10 20:14:07 UTC] akioartorius: Phil you said there were two moments in that montage that made you "die of laughter" which two moments were they?
[2017-02-10 20:14:08 UTC] darksydephil: there are at least 2 more montages on the way, and possibility of a 3rd if its finished this week

[2017-02-10 20:17:56 UTC] snowstormx30: Uwe bozo has a brutal one hit kill
[2017-02-10 20:17:56 UTC] akioartorius: Insomniac, dodge until he has about 30 percent stamina and then use heavy attacks in mid stance. He will be stun and you can get the finisher. wash rinse repeat
[2017-02-10 20:17:59 UTC] darksydephil: 2 bosses yesterday, and boy do they showcase the dos and donts of game design lol
[2017-02-10 20:18:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the first hour was amazing iconicmaster1 boss was tricky and resulted in 25 deaths but Phil overcame it
[2017-02-10 20:18:04 UTC] yacherdy: you yelling at me hurt my feelings.
[2017-02-10 20:18:04 UTC] bethe2670: and he got fucked over by the centipede 3 times which pissed him off

[2017-02-10 20:19:02 UTC] riouinsuiko: Well you know phil, that stupid centipede, is actually really easy if you figure out how it works. If it hits you once, or you block once (for the first 3/4 of the fight) it will stop charging and stand up
[2017-02-10 20:19:06 UTC] akioartorius: Hi Delta
[2017-02-10 20:19:09 UTC] oinkerbob: Phil, your audio had a little hiccup.
[2017-02-10 20:19:11 UTC] riouinsuiko: so if you block you can just dodge and hit it and take like no damage
[2017-02-10 20:19:12 UTC] yacherdy: Hello @DeltaForce355

[2017-02-10 20:21:53 UTC] deltaforce355: in my opinion dragin
[2017-02-10 20:21:54 UTC] yacherdy: Pretty sure that montage was done awfully on purpose...guy follows detractor YouTubers
[2017-02-10 20:21:59 UTC] deltaforce355: maybe you will like it
[2017-02-10 20:22:04 UTC] podusmonens: I know delta, I'm kidding
[2017-02-10 20:22:10 UTC] podusmonens: I probably won't
[2017-02-10 20:22:13 UTC] ginosaji48: funny that you still think you can be a mod bethe :D

[2017-02-10 20:22:42 UTC] darksydephil: just because a new montage is short and isn't super negative like *** doesn't make it bad. it just makes YOU stupid for calling it bad, lol
[2017-02-10 20:22:46 UTC] bethe2670: i can be a great mod
[2017-02-10 20:22:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hmmm

[2017-02-10 20:23:09 UTC] yacherdy: I see what side Pops is on. Good to know.
[2017-02-10 20:23:16 UTC] bentboxer: you think the haters would grow up and have lives by now
[2017-02-10 20:23:16 UTC] darksydephil: there are plenty of legit reasons for calling something bad, sadly most of the "criticism" of the new montage isn't valid at all
[2017-02-10 20:23:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: fight the power YaCherdy
[2017-02-10 20:23:21 UTC] podusmonens: so you can never say things are bad? mkay...
[2017-02-10 20:23:28 UTC] akioartorius: who has been here the longest?
[2017-02-10 20:23:31 UTC] an_ohio_fan: @darksydephil so people having their own opinion on something makes them stupid?
[2017-02-10 20:23:36 UTC] aglet57: Some strange creative choices in the montage, but I thought it was ok. The whole program is a work in progress.
[2017-02-10 20:23:42 UTC] bethe2670: also thx pops
[2017-02-10 20:23:44 UTC] yacherdy: well Phil its an opinion that its bad. No reason to get mad over it.
[2017-02-10 20:23:46 UTC] darksydephil: if it's an unjustified opinion with nothing to back it up? yes, it makes them stupid
[2017-02-10 20:23:53 UTC] deltaforce355: from the looks of it, the guy who did the montage is subbed to phil's detractors
[2017-02-10 20:23:59 UTC] darksydephil: it's hating fo rthe sake of hating because of jealousy, honestly
[2017-02-10 20:24:00 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: it was good montage, good job
[2017-02-10 20:24:16 UTC] deltaforce355: weird that phil didnt know that
[2017-02-10 20:24:18 UTC] navarre26: I don't care how negative or not the montage was Phil, the fact stands that the quality of last montage was sub par, at best
[2017-02-10 20:24:24 UTC] bethe2670: ohhhh yacherdy is arguing with phil you know that gets points taken away
[2017-02-10 20:24:25 UTC] spade137: yeah delta stop being a detractor SwiftRage
[2017-02-10 20:24:26 UTC] darksydephil: what makes you think i didnt know that? lol
[2017-02-10 20:24:34 UTC] aglet57: @DeltaForce355 Some people in here follow detractors, some detractors follow Phil and his fans. It goes both ways
[2017-02-10 20:24:35 UTC] darksydephil: do you think im retarded? tha ti didn't check his channel beforehand?
[2017-02-10 20:24:37 UTC] podusmonens: let's hear delta's reasons. why did you think the montage was bad, deltaforce335?
[2017-02-10 20:24:46 UTC] an_ohio_fan: @darksydephil he's allowed to say how he felt about it
[2017-02-10 20:24:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh boy
[2017-02-10 20:24:51 UTC] yacherdy: @bethe2670 hey hey now...I'm not arguing. Just pointing out how I feel about the situation Kreygasm
[2017-02-10 20:24:55 UTC] bethe2670: both montages were awesome
[2017-02-10 20:25:02 UTC] iconicmaster1: WutFace
[2017-02-10 20:25:04 UTC] popsicolo: As long as Phil has to the means to prevent and handle copyright issues, It probably doesn't matter who made them.
[2017-02-10 20:25:09 UTC] deltaforce355: i didnt say you are a retarded phil
[2017-02-10 20:25:11 UTC] theycallmejimbob: YaCherdy, I like someone who's honest rather than a bootlicker
[2017-02-10 20:25:11 UTC] thekingofsimpletonshd: dennis the detractor
[2017-02-10 20:25:13 UTC] bethe2670: /me playfully hits yacherdy

[2017-02-10 20:25:18 UTC] yacherdy: lel
[2017-02-10 20:25:19 UTC] bethe2670: dont worry about it
[2017-02-10 20:25:21 UTC] aglet57: The dog heads and that type of stuff were just sort of forced. But the clips he chose were very good.
[2017-02-10 20:25:28 UTC] darksydephil: every montage is going to be different. different people have different styles. there's an official *** style vid coming up in hte next few days too. different strokes for different folks
[2017-02-10 20:25:32 UTC] ginosaji48: this statement wont change my mind about your mod possibility bethe
[2017-02-10 20:25:37 UTC] akioartorius: Tensions are already high in the pre stream. I thought we were suppose to watch/play Nioh not kill each other. kappa
[2017-02-10 20:25:39 UTC] yacherdy: lol censored

[2017-02-10 20:26:06 UTC] yacherdy: DBstyle
[2017-02-10 20:26:09 UTC] darksydephil: just because not every video im featuring isn't a *** style doens't mean they're all bad. it just means the people complaining have a specific taste and nee dto grow up
[2017-02-10 20:26:16 UTC] navarre26: I'm just saying you need to have a better quality check before you decide to upload something as shitty as the last montage. It was absolutely terrible
[2017-02-10 20:26:21 UTC] spade137: what style?
[2017-02-10 20:26:25 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: good that you are embracing this style, i guess
[2017-02-10 20:26:34 UTC] ethanmustdie: This chat is PJSalt FailFish and BabyRage
[2017-02-10 20:26:36 UTC] darksydephil: yeah thats enough. 3 lines shitting on it without anything valid to say, get the fuck out
[2017-02-10 20:26:38 UTC] an_ohio_fan: @darksydephil what you are saying is not making in sense...
[2017-02-10 20:26:47 UTC] yacherdy: wow
[2017-02-10 20:26:47 UTC] darksydephil: what im saying makes perfect sense, actually

[2017-02-10 21:32:55 UTC] bammbino: @mr_vidar_viking, no, its a game that is focused on level suggestion per mission so they tried to have you chalenged when you do the missions at X Y or Z level -- its not like dark souls or bloodborne where a lv150 can die to a early game boss
[2017-02-10 21:32:57 UTC] bethe2670: dspHmm
[2017-02-10 21:32:58 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Yesterday he died a lot

[2017-02-10 21:33:02 UTC] bbt_2017: @royal_phalanx91 it gets harder the farther you get like every game
[2017-02-10 21:33:03 UTC] yacherdy: lol
[2017-02-10 21:33:27 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I'm too used to dark souls I guess, that stayed hard from start to finish
[2017-02-10 21:33:34 UTC] neuroblack77: I think he should do way less side missions so that he can do the missions at below recommended level.
[2017-02-10 21:33:40 UTC] yacherdy: This game seems like a mix of emotions.
[2017-02-10 21:33:49 UTC] tenpiece32: @akioartorius a lot to the boss then 6 or 7 after none today
[2017-02-10 21:33:55 UTC] yacherdy: I'm not quite sure what to think about it.

[2017-02-10 21:34:12 UTC] marpat1993: It got downscaled hard
[2017-02-10 21:34:14 UTC] neuroblack77: I think the difficulty was hyped up too much just like with the Souls games.

[2017-02-10 21:40:18 UTC] bammbino: @Royal_Phalanx91, yeah they did a piss poor job at explaining the unlimited stats in beta
[2017-02-10 21:40:27 UTC] kg12228: this game gives u way too much loot to even want to reforge

[2017-02-10 21:41:33 UTC] bammbino: soul match prices are unchanged.. they better nerf it
[2017-02-10 21:41:47 UTC] kg12228: @xgameofpwns I just use gold to buy ammo which is an actual useful thing not reforge
[2017-02-10 21:41:48 UTC] yacherdy: bethe are you talking to Ichigo in a seperate chat?

[2017-02-10 21:42:25 UTC] mitlaufer: this game might be the first dark souls-like game I actually play, I never really liked how "alone" you feel in dark souls, even though I see the appeal of it by other players
[2017-02-10 21:42:46 UTC] akioartorius: so is Senji Tome polishing her hammer?
[2017-02-10 21:42:48 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: It has a bit more of a undepressing atmosphere

[2017-02-10 21:43:04 UTC] euffy: Dark Souls has charachter customization and scythes, all I need <3
[2017-02-10 21:43:15 UTC] 12345tyeu: youre not alone in dark souls
[2017-02-10 21:43:16 UTC] xgameofpwns: anybody try co-op? I wanted to try that arcade mode where you and your partner don't get healing items but none of my friends want this game :(
[2017-02-10 21:43:22 UTC] akioartorius: nioh has scythes also but...
[2017-02-10 21:43:23 UTC] neonbornspartan9: some want a woman who makes them sandwiches, I want one that makes me weapons/armor / TriHard \
[2017-02-10 21:43:23 UTC] bammbino: @mitlaufer, thats because this game isnt what souls is -- its a very forgiving game that borrows from witcher, soulsborne, and of course elements from their main franchise ninja gaiden
[2017-02-10 21:43:28 UTC] easton_taylor1: @icecream20 Get That Ass Banned!

[2017-02-10 21:43:42 UTC] marpat1993: What kind of blacksmith polishes his hammer?
[2017-02-10 21:43:52 UTC] xgameofpwns: @Neuroblack77 I'll prolly try it today

[2017-02-10 21:44:34 UTC] bammbino: @Xgameofpwns, co-op is a bit op right now.. tons of people crying but the devs recently stated that they intentionally made it really hard so it wasnt "too easy"
[2017-02-10 21:44:37 UTC] kg12228: @kinggoken why would anyone like to be reminded of that guy

[2017-02-10 22:54:33 UTC] akioartorius: Popsicolo, I see you played SMTIV: apocalypse.
[2017-02-10 22:54:44 UTC] xkenwallx: So death counter up to 52....assuming this game got harder for Phil since he made that video lol
[2017-02-10 22:54:50 UTC] xgameofpwns: @roflsteaks although the spear has some fun combos so im dissapointed that it's so cheesy
[2017-02-10 22:54:53 UTC] riouinsuiko: use a summoners candle dsp
[2017-02-10 22:54:57 UTC] neuroblack77: Muneshige tore him a new one
[2017-02-10 22:55:03 UTC] popsicolo: I happened to have been watching Mara videos just last night, actually.
[2017-02-10 22:55:07 UTC] prince_vegetaa: @bethe2670 be patient. Read enemy movement/attack. Die, repeat. Get gud. You'll feelsgoodman once you do.
[2017-02-10 22:55:11 UTC] popsicolo: Neat little coincidence

[2017-02-10 22:55:43 UTC] roflsteaks: yeah seems like there is no real drawbacks to the spear. you have range, good dps, and the stat to increase its power also increases your health lol
[2017-02-10 22:55:43 UTC] neuroblack77: @Pr34ch He wouldn't use a hammer since he only knows one stance.
[2017-02-10 22:55:58 UTC] xgameofpwns: @Pr34ch can't exploit AI w/ pokes using hammers so it's useless for him

[2017-02-10 22:56:13 UTC] akioartorius: Phil picked spear and dual katana speciality

[2017-02-10 23:00:25 UTC] bethe2670: hmm
[2017-02-10 23:00:26 UTC] marpat1993: Lol

[2017-02-10 23:00:56 UTC] akioartorius: phil has leanna and his ex girlfriends
[2017-02-10 23:01:05 UTC] xgameofpwns: I actually like streamers who don't interact with chat much because it slows gameplay a lot
[2017-02-10 23:01:05 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bethe is thirsty as hell DeltaForce355
[2017-02-10 23:01:12 UTC] deltaforce355: i know

[2017-02-10 23:02:18 UTC] shotinthedeep: I dunno, but he made a tweet a week ago asking if he should do a politics channel or just make politics videos on one of his already existing channels
[2017-02-10 23:02:20 UTC] bethe2670: damn it
[2017-02-10 23:02:45 UTC] shotinthedeep: You like juice?
[2017-02-10 23:02:53 UTC] xgameofpwns: @shotinthedeep thats probably a bad idea because YT can demonetize videos deemed "controversial" -__-
[2017-02-10 23:03:22 UTC] bethe2670: i like juice...orange, titty, apple
[2017-02-10 23:03:23 UTC] akioartorius: Dead Island, get juice. Don't blow your balls off.
[2017-02-10 23:03:32 UTC] tenpiece32: @Xgameofpwns Phils game style has never been in close fighting and this game gave him the long spear lol
[2017-02-10 23:03:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bethe2670, cahman NotLikeThis
[2017-02-10 23:03:50 UTC] royal_phalanx91: titty juice is best juice
[2017-02-10 23:03:55 UTC] shotinthedeep: @Xgameofpwns well it doesn't affect any of the other videos. Just the new ones hes making. Actually all that matters for youtube is whats in the title or description of the video
[2017-02-10 23:04:09 UTC] bethe2670: you saw the middle one? i thought i camo it through orange and apple
[2017-02-10 23:04:10 UTC] phillymann: O.o

[2017-02-10 23:05:53 UTC] akioartorius: wow
[2017-02-10 23:05:55 UTC] neuroblack77: @Xgameofpwns You don't need to light all the torches.
[2017-02-10 23:06:06 UTC] akioartorius: torches are optional
[2017-02-10 23:06:26 UTC] akioartorius: but they do something if you light them
[2017-02-10 23:06:35 UTC] zombiebeer: got eeeem
[2017-02-10 23:06:42 UTC] xgameofpwns: @Neuroblack77 I know, no there's a certain hidden surface that i couldn't find
[2017-02-10 23:06:53 UTC] neuroblack77: @akioartorius I only lit the ones I could find
[2017-02-10 23:07:56 UTC] akioartorius: how many torches did you get?
[2017-02-10 23:08:02 UTC] lvlpower: one

[2017-02-10 23:08:32 UTC] neuroblack77: I guess I didn't need the last one.
[2017-02-10 23:08:34 UTC] xgameofpwns: CALLED IT!
[2017-02-10 23:08:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hmmmm

[2017-02-10 23:09:06 UTC] mc_burnout26: I saw lobos kill it with only lighting 2 torches
[2017-02-10 23:09:20 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: cheer123 yeay
[2017-02-10 23:09:25 UTC] neuroblack77: It's doable for sure
[2017-02-10 23:09:35 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: hmmm
[2017-02-10 23:09:36 UTC] xgameofpwns: I don't even know what the torches do tbh
[2017-02-10 23:09:39 UTC] akioartorius: you can kill umi-bozu without lighting the three torches they are optional
[2017-02-10 23:09:42 UTC] mc_burnout26: I know what he missed and where to get out of this area
[2017-02-10 23:09:48 UTC] roflsteaks: travelers charm
[2017-02-10 23:09:55 UTC] xgameofpwns: @Mc_burnout26 ;)
[2017-02-10 23:10:17 UTC] tenpiece32: sad part is he won't edit this part out for the youtube viewer once he finds the way out
[2017-02-10 23:10:19 UTC] mc_burnout26: and he walked by it a couple of times lol
[2017-02-10 23:10:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you're kinda dangling a carrot in front of a donkey Mc_burnout26 :P

[2017-02-10 23:11:13 UTC] shotinthedeep: why would he edit this out tenpiece32, the fact that this is hard to get through should be part for the viewer to see. It's a fault of the game devs and would be dishonest to leave it out
[2017-02-10 23:11:17 UTC] xgameofpwns: I like my gaming videos like I like my sex. unedited and raw. Naturally Phil's channel is where i came
[2017-02-10 23:11:24 UTC] killerinstinct3_: fight the bosss dude
[2017-02-10 23:11:31 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: you're not stuck

[2017-02-10 23:12:11 UTC] shotinthedeep: Yeah, if they designed it so hidden it is the fault of the game devs
[2017-02-10 23:12:12 UTC] xgameofpwns: there you go
[2017-02-10 23:12:15 UTC] shotinthedeep: See how hidden that was
[2017-02-10 23:12:20 UTC] ginosaji48: THANKS CHAT
[2017-02-10 23:12:20 UTC] tenpiece32: @shotinthedeep I understand but this is a why people get mad with the vid spam from him
[2017-02-10 23:12:22 UTC] neuroblack77: @shotinthedeep Really?

[2017-02-10 23:12:43 UTC] xgameofpwns: @shotinthedeep I agree you shouldn't be required to find "hidden" doors
[2017-02-10 23:12:43 UTC] deltaforce355: great reaction right there
[2017-02-10 23:12:46 UTC] popsicolo: Nice find, Phil. KappaHD

[2017-02-10 23:12:56 UTC] tenpiece32: Cut out just a tad to make it more fluent
[2017-02-10 23:13:03 UTC] shotinthedeep: Just putting out the good parts of the game makes the game look better than it acutually is
[2017-02-10 23:13:08 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: i mean it was right next to where you can see the area, not all that hidden to be fair. But still pretty hidden and probably purposefully so.
[2017-02-10 23:13:15 UTC] shotinthedeep: Which is why you should leave everything in
[2017-02-10 23:13:19 UTC] ginosaji48: game never explained him where to go, thats why chat had to help
[2017-02-10 23:13:28 UTC] bethe2670: guide*
