[2017-02-14 20:00:54 UTC] blue_blur64: At one point I had a thought of possibly doing a Pokemon Sun Pokedex reading montage :P
[2017-02-14 20:01:11 UTC] deltaforce355: why dont you get vegas lvlpower?
[2017-02-14 20:01:23 UTC] yacherdy: Getting the water ratio correct for Ramen is crucial. Too much and it'll become to watery (obviously0...too little and it becomes very dense and a little overpowering to the tongue.
[2017-02-14 20:01:29 UTC] yacherdy: too*
[2017-02-14 20:01:45 UTC] blue_blur64: lvlpower, try hitfilm out

[2017-02-14 20:02:57 UTC] yacherdy: IT'S POISON IVY PogChamp - Phil, Arkham Asylum playthrough - 2009
[2017-02-14 20:03:00 UTC] darksydephil: this game is only 30fps so i can capture at 1080p for a change
[2017-02-14 20:03:12 UTC] yacherdy: Phil is a Ivy man....I'd go for Harley personally
[2017-02-14 20:03:19 UTC] blue_blur64: It is? Huh, I thought it would be 60fps

[2017-02-14 20:19:53 UTC] blue_blur64: What is she talking about!!! SwiftRage
[2017-02-14 20:19:59 UTC] alex_dragonul: I thought it was good , funny at times but annoying and cringe worthy too , i am not a fan of those anywa so never really liked them too much , so i prob will never watch one again in a long time , the one that phil had from that guy was the first one in a long time
[2017-02-14 20:19:59 UTC] bethe2670: silent :D lol
[2017-02-14 20:20:15 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Damnit didnt realise it was a for honor stream...
[2017-02-14 20:20:17 UTC] aglet57: That Deadpool intro was kind of lame

[2017-02-14 20:20:32 UTC] yacherdy: There are some really good edited TIHYDP's
[2017-02-14 20:20:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Gino admit it it was you in the deadpool mask at the start of that TIHYDP video
[2017-02-14 20:20:38 UTC] spade137: play mutiplayer or riot
[2017-02-14 20:20:48 UTC] lvlpower: @bethe2670 dairy queen blizzards Kreygasm

[2017-02-14 20:20:53 UTC] ginosaji48: also that match Bayley vs Charlotte Flair was mostly overacted
[2017-02-14 20:21:05 UTC] katexo234: bleedPurple
[2017-02-14 20:21:07 UTC] ginosaji48: no jimbob
[2017-02-14 20:21:10 UTC] deltaforce355: but will that same quality will be on KO gaming?
[2017-02-14 20:21:18 UTC] yacherdy: obviously, it just depends on who is making it. I've seen some hilarious edits mixed in there with the gameplay from Phil
[2017-02-14 20:21:19 UTC] bethe2670: kate what up?
[2017-02-14 20:21:21 UTC] encelor: hey akioarthorius how you doing

[2017-02-14 20:21:36 UTC] shotinthedeep: I love bayley
[2017-02-14 20:21:37 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Deadpool intro was intensely cringey. Also why did the video need 3 intros? Phils intro, deadpool cringefest intro and them the TIHYDP intro...
[2017-02-14 20:21:59 UTC] bethe2670: why not

[2017-02-14 20:22:11 UTC] darksydephil: fuzzy, it was the first one id ever approved and posted. without an intro, how would it even make sense? lol
[2017-02-14 20:22:16 UTC] shotinthedeep: TIHYDP needs 5 more intros
[2017-02-14 20:22:18 UTC] yacherdy: thats my ringtone Gino
[2017-02-14 20:22:21 UTC] spade137: phil needs to stop adding intros

[2017-02-14 20:22:49 UTC] ginosaji48: bitch please YaCherdy, thats my alarm clock
[2017-02-14 20:22:51 UTC] aglet57: No intro would save time, but would rob the maker of their props.
