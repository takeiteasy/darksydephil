[2017-02-22 19:50:19 UTC] bethe2670: because i got a username for a reason
[2017-02-22 19:50:21 UTC] bethe2670: :P
[2017-02-22 19:50:21 UTC] yacherdy: I have a guy who walks up my street every morning with just a long raincoat, nazi boots and high black socks on and drinks out of a paper bag.
[2017-02-22 19:50:23 UTC] darksydephil: there's a 1 million bit badge, lol
[2017-02-22 19:50:33 UTC] bethe2670: yeah
[2017-02-22 19:50:35 UTC] shotinthedeep: lol Phil
[2017-02-22 19:50:51 UTC] mc_burnout26: that would be crazy to see lol
[2017-02-22 19:50:52 UTC] bethe2670: yacherdy its a pedo be careful
[2017-02-22 19:50:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: 10K for a badge hmmm
[2017-02-22 19:50:55 UTC] shotinthedeep: That's $10000
[2017-02-22 19:51:00 UTC] shotinthedeep: more if you buy them
[2017-02-22 19:51:17 UTC] podusmonens: you know there's some hardcore stuff in that paper bag cherdy
[2017-02-22 19:51:28 UTC] shotinthedeep: No way someones getting a million bits by watching videos
[2017-02-22 19:51:28 UTC] podusmonens: like homebrew beer or even wine
[2017-02-22 19:51:30 UTC] yacherdy: @bethe2670 Hide your kids, hide your wife
[2017-02-22 19:51:32 UTC] bethe2670: some hardcore druuugs
[2017-02-22 19:51:46 UTC] yacherdy: Maybe absinthe
[2017-02-22 19:51:49 UTC] bethe2670: the wife is fine pedos dont like full grown adults
[2017-02-22 19:52:06 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bethe the stream hasn't even started yet and you've jumped the shark
[2017-02-22 19:52:06 UTC] mc_burnout26: I joined one stream on the launch of Nioh and a streamer made about 2k in 5 mins off of donations
[2017-02-22 19:52:23 UTC] dspneedsajob: Before I was banned, I saw bethe say that it won't matter if Phil is banned from Twitch 'cause he can go to Youtube. Wrong. He's complaining about revenue on Youtube and there is no cheer/sub system over there. His revenue on Youtube, according to him, keeps plummeting.It's inevitable. He will not be doing this for much longer. TIME TO GET A JOB.
[2017-02-22 19:52:24 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob gotta start early maaan
[2017-02-22 19:52:30 UTC] aglet57: hey twitch

[2017-02-22 19:54:03 UTC] mc_burnout26: got me some Dr pepper.
[2017-02-22 19:54:05 UTC] shotinthedeep: you talked to that guy ever yacherdy?
[2017-02-22 19:54:06 UTC] darksydephil: why are you talking about Tevin in here, exactly?
[2017-02-22 19:54:17 UTC] yacherdy: No deep
[2017-02-22 19:54:26 UTC] shotinthedeep: Who is tevin?
[2017-02-22 19:54:27 UTC] aglet57: How close are we to the end of Nioh? Anyone know?

[2017-02-22 19:54:51 UTC] yacherdy: Is Tevin not to be discussed?
[2017-02-22 19:54:53 UTC] aglet57: Tevin's a vlogger or something
[2017-02-22 19:54:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil said there was 3 story missions left AGLET57
[2017-02-22 19:55:04 UTC] aglet57: Cool!
[2017-02-22 19:55:06 UTC] shotinthedeep: oh ok...rule 9 n yacherdy
[2017-02-22 19:55:07 UTC] bethe2670: yacherdy why bring it here thats the point
[2017-02-22 19:55:16 UTC] darksydephil: this is my stream chat. why would you discuss people who regulardly denigrate me in here?
[2017-02-22 19:55:18 UTC] darksydephil: use your head kid
[2017-02-22 19:55:35 UTC] mc_burnout26: if u want to discuss that stuff u could pm the people
[2017-02-22 19:55:41 UTC] aglet57: I'm sure it was just an honest mistake. Not sure how often the rules are read. lol
[2017-02-22 19:55:52 UTC] sirdi3salot: And yet you insult your viewers
[2017-02-22 19:56:05 UTC] bethe2670: rules here HA
[2017-02-22 19:56:24 UTC] theycallmejimbob: just because you flout em regularly bethe doesn't mean there isn't rules :D
[2017-02-22 19:56:27 UTC] papercraftsamurai: hi everyone

[2017-02-22 19:57:25 UTC] leonaras: Yeah guys, Dont talk about tevin here. Tevin produces thought provoking quality content. Dont sully it by discussing it here Kappa
[2017-02-22 19:57:32 UTC] bethe2670: he would prob have to ban himself too
[2017-02-22 19:57:50 UTC] darksydephil: lol so today im wearing a new shirt from lootcrate
[2017-02-22 19:57:51 UTC] shotinthedeep: Then gino would unban them all Kappa
[2017-02-22 19:57:56 UTC] mc_burnout26: I remember one time when DSP was streaming the first time we wernt even talking about the game instead we were discussing our favorite hentai.
[2017-02-22 19:58:00 UTC] bethe2670: lol deep
[2017-02-22 19:58:01 UTC] bethe2670: :D

[2017-02-22 19:58:12 UTC] ginosaji48: /me slaps deep and bethe
[2017-02-22 19:58:14 UTC] papercraftsamurai: TIME TO GET A JOB
[2017-02-22 19:58:15 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: the rules could maybe need a review at some point. I havenn't seen many nyan cats late3ly
[2017-02-22 19:58:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: welp
[2017-02-22 19:58:16 UTC] darksydephil: and its a large, like all the shirts they send me. yet this one is tight as hell. other shirts they send are loose. how these companies still can't figure out that large is the same fucking size i dont get it lol
[2017-02-22 19:58:19 UTC] bethe2670: ohhh a lootcrate shirt
[2017-02-22 19:58:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: they're out in force today :(
[2017-02-22 19:58:26 UTC] shotinthedeep: oh hi gino :D good to see ya
[2017-02-22 19:58:33 UTC] yacherdy: I'll try to use my child like brain next time. :)
[2017-02-22 19:58:38 UTC] ginosaji48: /me slaps deep
[2017-02-22 19:58:56 UTC] bethe2670: yes hello gino
[2017-02-22 19:58:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey Gino
[2017-02-22 19:59:00 UTC] darksydephil: ok let me get the stream running, then ill grab drinks
[2017-02-22 19:59:02 UTC] bethe2670: he always comes in slapping
[2017-02-22 19:59:06 UTC] ginosaji48: /me slaps bethe
[2017-02-22 19:59:08 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: okey
[2017-02-22 19:59:17 UTC] mc_burnout26: /me slaps both of u guys
[2017-02-22 19:59:24 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I see you are salty today gino, slaping all around
[2017-02-22 19:59:32 UTC] darksydephil: but yeah, what great youtube analytics. they say that my views are down my 13% this month (which makes sense, RE7 boosted them last month) but ad revenue for DSPGaming is down by 35%. wow. what a great correlation there
[2017-02-22 19:59:41 UTC] ginosaji48: not salty
[2017-02-22 19:59:42 UTC] bethe2670: well he slapped me and deep 2 times already
[2017-02-22 19:59:42 UTC] shotinthedeep: ouch
[2017-02-22 19:59:50 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: WOW that is really bad phil
[2017-02-22 19:59:57 UTC] aglet57: @DarksydePhil Could it be adblock users? Would that explain that?
[2017-02-22 20:00:08 UTC] podusmonens: can't you talk to machinima to see what's going on?
[2017-02-22 20:00:16 UTC] aglet57: Personally, mine is off when I'm on YT for you and other people I'm trying to support
[2017-02-22 20:00:25 UTC] bethe2670: yo i want my money bitches i deserve it
[2017-02-22 20:00:28 UTC] bethe2670: :D
[2017-02-22 20:00:40 UTC] bethe2670: you do deserve it phil though
[2017-02-22 20:00:53 UTC] ginosaji48: fuck SDL
[2017-02-22 20:00:53 UTC] mc_burnout26: I got my taxes in early so now I have so much money now :)
[2017-02-22 20:00:54 UTC] darksydephil: i did ask machinima. their initial reply was "you are on pace to have about hte same amount of ad impressions in february as you did in january." which doesn't answer the question, AT ALL, as to why those impressions are 35% less profitable. so i just wrote them back asking them that
[2017-02-22 20:01:01 UTC] podusmonens: I was offering a solution, not flattery bethe stop
[2017-02-22 20:01:09 UTC] bethe2670: gino the womens belt is back where it belongs
[2017-02-22 20:01:15 UTC] anondublo1: sup fags
[2017-02-22 20:01:21 UTC] podusmonens: youtube is simply fucked, then, Phil
[2017-02-22 20:01:24 UTC] aglet57: Do different ads pay differently? Is that a thing?
[2017-02-22 20:01:28 UTC] ginosaji48: racist fucks in sdl
[2017-02-22 20:01:36 UTC] aglet57: Or is it supposed to be a flat pay?
[2017-02-22 20:01:43 UTC] freshjiivetv: I made the same in Feb as I made in Jan on twitch, if that helps
[2017-02-22 20:01:46 UTC] podusmonens: big youtubers had some sort of campaign to help that but it kinda fizzled out, didn;t it?
[2017-02-22 20:01:48 UTC] bethe2670: gino Naomi is injured HOW is that racist
[2017-02-22 20:01:49 UTC] freshjiivetv: *Youtube not twitch
[2017-02-22 20:02:01 UTC] podusmonens: now pewdie has bogger problems than small youtube channels getting screwed
[2017-02-22 20:02:06 UTC] podusmonens: bigger*
[2017-02-22 20:02:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: so there's 35% less payout cpm compared to January?
[2017-02-22 20:02:09 UTC] mc_burnout26: I guess the companies that make those ads realize that youtube is no longer profitable
[2017-02-22 20:02:19 UTC] aglet57: I think you really need to explain all of this in that vlog. Honestly, I don't understand how any of this works.
[2017-02-22 20:02:21 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob yes cant you read
[2017-02-22 20:02:29 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: pewdipie problems give me a break dragin. He is a millionare
[2017-02-22 20:02:34 UTC] podusmonens: big channels still make big bucks burnout how do you explain that?
[2017-02-22 20:02:37 UTC] ginosaji48: of course, its completely normal to give title back to alexa while she was cheating to win
[2017-02-22 20:02:47 UTC] darksydephil: exactly jimbob, or at least its not proportionate. if i got 13% less views in february compared to january, it makes no sense id be making 35% less money. it should be equivalent and its not
[2017-02-22 20:02:53 UTC] bethe2670: gino its back where it belongs
[2017-02-22 20:02:55 UTC] anondublo1: too privileged to have problems Kappa
[2017-02-22 20:03:02 UTC] ginosaji48: /me kicks bethe
[2017-02-22 20:03:10 UTC] bethe2670: OW
[2017-02-22 20:03:18 UTC] aglet57: hmm
[2017-02-22 20:03:47 UTC] bethe2670: its just a shame that Alexa couldn't beat naomi for the belt :(
[2017-02-22 20:03:50 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn that sucks Phil
[2017-02-22 20:03:55 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: if you have 10 million views per day, you don'tr have any problems.. No matter what the mdia throws at you. You reach more people than the medai anyways'
[2017-02-22 20:04:00 UTC] sandxrapclone: Hi DSP
[2017-02-22 20:04:04 UTC] aglet57: Seems like popup blockers or ublock or adblock to me. Seems like a logical explanation, albeit a shitty siutation
[2017-02-22 20:04:04 UTC] sandxrapclone: huge fan
[2017-02-22 20:04:05 UTC] anondublo1: I'd blame adblock tbh. Like everyone uses adblock.
[2017-02-22 20:04:11 UTC] bethe2670: becky didnt deserve a double throat punch and pulling the tights
[2017-02-22 20:04:19 UTC] anondublo1: Trying to make money off ads is difficult even for major companies these days.
[2017-02-22 20:04:40 UTC] sandxrapclone: im a HUUUUGE fan
[2017-02-22 20:04:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it's not adblock though anondublo1 he's saying he is in line to have the same amount of impressions as last month but the payment is 35% less
[2017-02-22 20:05:01 UTC] ginosaji48: Daniel Bryan comes out, takes the title from Naomi in a way like "Fuck you bitch give it here" then "surprisingly Alexa comes out and says she wants "her" title back, then 1 vs 1 on Becky, alexa cheats and win....suck my dick smackdown
[2017-02-22 20:05:02 UTC] aglet57: Could you do a private drawing for some of your statues, Phil?
[2017-02-22 20:05:05 UTC] darksydephil: right. it cant be adblock if the impressions are the same as january
[2017-02-22 20:05:12 UTC] mc_burnout26: so the ads this month wasnt as lucrative as the month before.
[2017-02-22 20:05:13 UTC] anondublo1: well, he makes money off ad views now right? not views?
[2017-02-22 20:05:16 UTC] darksydephil: it means its an actual issue with ad revenue and that's on youtube
[2017-02-22 20:05:17 UTC] sandxrapclone: DSP do you like adblock?
[2017-02-22 20:05:22 UTC] sandxrapclone: i use it often
[2017-02-22 20:05:57 UTC] draco_newt: Gradius playthrough when?
[2017-02-22 20:05:59 UTC] darksydephil: if it were an adblock issue, ad impressions would be way down. they're not
[2017-02-22 20:06:26 UTC] lagfairy0: too many youtubers with there hands in the ad revenue pot. only so much money to go around.
[2017-02-22 20:06:27 UTC] bethe2670: gino d-bry did his job by asking for the belt back naomi couldnt defend it plus alexa was number 1 contender and who else is going to fight her other than becky, nattie and nikki had a match so cant be them. also alexa deserves the belt
[2017-02-22 20:06:31 UTC] anondublo1: yeah, not sure about that one then, that's the only way I could see that being the issue
[2017-02-22 20:06:44 UTC] ginosaji48: if there is first black woman champion, then take the title from her in one week and give it to fucking alexa for no reason
[2017-02-22 20:07:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: we're live
[2017-02-22 20:07:02 UTC] ginosaji48: fuck sdl im gonna watch RAW
[2017-02-22 20:07:10 UTC] bethe2670: gino naomi IS INJURED
[2017-02-22 20:07:11 UTC] shotinthedeep: Live :D
[2017-02-22 20:07:14 UTC] bethe2670: geez
[2017-02-22 20:07:19 UTC] darksydephil: id love ot know when Naomi actually hurt her leg, because she never sold it in the match
[2017-02-22 20:07:23 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: does it have anything to say that februaryt is shorter?
[2017-02-22 20:07:30 UTC] mc_burnout26: I watch some other youtubers that are doing fine without patreon but they have it and also stream to have a donation link.
[2017-02-22 20:07:51 UTC] bethe2670: you cant fight on one fucking leg
[2017-02-22 20:07:59 UTC] bethe2670: smh
[2017-02-22 20:08:04 UTC] anondublo1: I'm not sure if 3 days would make a significant difference, definitely not 35%
[2017-02-22 20:08:05 UTC] darksydephil: viking, no, this is taking a proportionate amount of time in january vs february. not month vs month overall. february isn't over anyway, there'd be no way for that to factor in yet
[2017-02-22 20:08:18 UTC] ginosaji48: and why to give it to alexa ? she did nothng to deserve it, why not make big womens match for title so it could be fair ?.......nah just give it to that b*tch
[2017-02-22 20:08:25 UTC] freshjiivetv: So Im looking at my ad rev for the last 2 months. 1.1m views for Jan and 700k this month so far and no real increase or decrease in ad rev except around super bowl when it went up
[2017-02-22 20:08:40 UTC] bethe2670: gino calm down i thought you wasn't salty
[2017-02-22 20:08:52 UTC] darksydephil: gino, did you watch smackdown?
[2017-02-22 20:08:56 UTC] darksydephil: they had a match for the title lol
[2017-02-22 20:09:01 UTC] bethe2670: naomi is injured so she HAD to give up the belt
[2017-02-22 20:09:02 UTC] darksydephil: i have no idea what you're talking about
[2017-02-22 20:09:08 UTC] mfd4419: Hello everyone
[2017-02-22 20:09:14 UTC] shotinthedeep: hi mfd4419
[2017-02-22 20:09:20 UTC] aglet57: hey @mfd4419

[2017-02-22 20:09:27 UTC] bethe2670: becky and alexa where the only 2 who could fight for it so that match happened
[2017-02-22 20:09:31 UTC] ginosaji48: yea i saw alexa win by cheating over becky, nicely done by sdl
[2017-02-22 20:09:34 UTC] aglet57: Alexa is SO good
[2017-02-22 20:09:35 UTC] tom_cat_01: hiiiiii everyone
[2017-02-22 20:09:39 UTC] bethe2670: and yes alexa cheated but she is heel
[2017-02-22 20:09:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hello Tom_cat_01

[2017-02-22 20:23:29 UTC] aglet57: Too much live streaming. If you need the views on YT, maybe you shouldn't live stream every day? You were going to do that before Twitch happened.
[2017-02-22 20:23:31 UTC] anondublo1: Maybe you should focus more on streaming, and fan/personal edits of your playthroughs?
