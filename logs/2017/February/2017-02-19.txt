[2017-02-19 19:42:15 UTC] yacherdy: There are three people who disliked the video last night: Trolls, people who didn't like the title being used and people who didn't like what you said in the review itself. Or a combination of all three. But mostly the first one.
[2017-02-19 19:42:25 UTC] yacherdy: three kinds of people *

[2017-02-19 19:45:30 UTC] kingjadvcmp: i was watching one of Phil's vlogs earlier, where he blames YouTube for algorithm changes for his content not showing up. I'm just wondering what Phil has done over the years to combat these algorithm changes, cos there's been several after all
[2017-02-19 19:45:38 UTC] bethe2670: it was ok
[2017-02-19 19:45:51 UTC] deltaforce355: same
[2017-02-19 19:46:35 UTC] yacherdy: $1,200 for my dream graphics card and monitor alone. Shit.
[2017-02-19 19:46:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I thought he said KingjadVCMP youtube not disclosing what they changed in the algorithm screwed him.(I might be wrong with that)
[2017-02-19 19:46:50 UTC] bethe2670: yacherdy :D
[2017-02-19 19:46:59 UTC] bethe2670: /me gives yacherdy a money tree
[2017-02-19 19:47:00 UTC] bethe2670: :D
[2017-02-19 19:47:05 UTC] kingjadvcmp: but the algorithm has changed numberous times over the years
[2017-02-19 19:47:19 UTC] kingjadvcmp: so I'm just wondering how a full-time YouTuber combats these
[2017-02-19 19:47:43 UTC] deltaforce355: phil should use apps like tubebuddy
[2017-02-19 19:47:49 UTC] theycallmejimbob: what sort of graphics card costs that and what sort of power supply would you need YaCherdy
[2017-02-19 19:47:53 UTC] yacherdy: thanks bethe Kappa

[2017-02-19 19:48:36 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob 1080 graphics card would cost 600 and the EVGA supernova 750 gold 80+ or what not could do it
[2017-02-19 19:48:53 UTC] deltaforce355: wonder why phil dont know about tubebuddy
[2017-02-19 19:48:57 UTC] deltaforce355: its useful

[2017-02-19 19:52:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: what games do you play to warrant spending that on a graphics card YaCherdy?
[2017-02-19 19:52:47 UTC] darksydephil: lets see how Yakuza 0 tanks that, LOL
[2017-02-19 19:52:47 UTC] masternutella: Is Yakuza 0 like a remastered?
[2017-02-19 19:52:57 UTC] ginosaji48: my wife came to visit me and we were walking down the stairs, i wasnt paying attention and leff

[2017-02-19 19:53:32 UTC] ginosaji48: so i have broken leg now
[2017-02-19 19:53:34 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob I play a lot of current games and want to future proof myself...the 1080 card is a little overkill right now but like I said it's just a dream card. 1070 is more likely.
[2017-02-19 19:53:35 UTC] bethe2670: oww
[2017-02-19 19:53:39 UTC] darksydephil: wait a minute
[2017-02-19 19:53:41 UTC] kingjadvcmp: damn, broken leg? fuck that's rough
[2017-02-19 19:53:43 UTC] darksydephil: didnt you have a broken leg last year?!

[2017-02-19 19:54:02 UTC] kingjadvcmp: was it the same leg at least?
[2017-02-19 19:54:04 UTC] bethe2670: well then
[2017-02-19 19:54:05 UTC] darksydephil: holy christ man
[2017-02-19 19:54:25 UTC] ginosaji48: i broke my leg like 2 times and both hands once already
[2017-02-19 19:54:32 UTC] masternutella: Jesus

[2017-02-19 19:55:32 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I thought you needed surgery or something?
[2017-02-19 19:55:36 UTC] masternutella: How long do broken bones heal?
[2017-02-19 19:55:38 UTC] bethe2670: gino are you clumsy?
[2017-02-19 19:55:42 UTC] kingjadvcmp: anyways gino that sucks man
[2017-02-19 19:55:47 UTC] kingjadvcmp: some folk are just really unlucky
[2017-02-19 19:55:54 UTC] darksydephil: the surgery would have been to fuse the bones together around the damaged disc. but the bones aren't broken
[2017-02-19 19:55:56 UTC] yacherdy: My sister broke her back in a car crash when she was younger...had to wear a back brace

[2017-02-19 20:25:40 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I don't know why some people don't just edit an entire Phil playthrough, except cut out the boring parts - like for Nioh, cut out the majority of upgrading, wandering etc, just focus on the actual action. Would make it more digestable
[2017-02-19 20:25:44 UTC] skysands2017: hey @jmon_1985

[2017-02-19 20:26:17 UTC] anondublo1: better to make money off something tearing into you than have it be uploaded somewhere else, if it's strictly about views/money.
[2017-02-19 20:26:17 UTC] derichloveslemur: Twitch and Chill marathon sometime in February @DarksydePhil?

[2017-02-19 22:14:46 UTC] capstonegaming: For Honor is why ubisoft can never be taken seriously
[2017-02-19 22:14:52 UTC] garlicshrimp: for kiryuu can you take over almost all of kamurocho with his real estate thing?
[2017-02-19 22:14:58 UTC] bobbi_ling: for honor is great though

[2017-02-19 22:20:55 UTC] tedicotuckz: It doesn't save it
[2017-02-19 22:20:57 UTC] popsicolo: This reminds me of the time I build a secret passage behind a bookshelf in my house in Fallout 4.
[2017-02-19 22:21:19 UTC] inthedarkarcade: ??? Why are there so few people on stream tonight? I suppose Yakuza still hasn't broken into the mainstream in the West.
