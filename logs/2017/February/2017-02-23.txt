[2017-02-23 19:24:47 UTC] bethe2670: lol
[2017-02-23 19:24:50 UTC] capstonegaming: if u can kill anybody like u can in new game + then u can do w/e u want and probably kill important npcs early on and the story be completely different
[2017-02-23 19:25:12 UTC] capstonegaming: i love way of the samurai in that regard
[2017-02-23 19:25:29 UTC] bethe2670: just kill ending boss straight away on new game + Kappa

[2017-02-23 19:25:54 UTC] capstonegaming: for not bowing as they walk by or whatever the case might be
[2017-02-23 19:26:19 UTC] capstonegaming: ^ you can bethe but thats why a blind playthourough is so dangerous
[2017-02-23 19:26:38 UTC] capstonegaming: u have the option to pull ur sword out at any tie to interrupt a cutscene with battle
[2017-02-23 19:26:48 UTC] capstonegaming: and if u do that on the wrong ones ull get swarmed and rekt

[2017-02-23 19:27:57 UTC] capstonegaming: "How was i supposed to know thats the general and he can one shot me? hes just some guy being arrogant on the street corner! WTF!"
[2017-02-23 19:28:17 UTC] capstonegaming: naw i only have one controller

[2017-02-23 19:30:56 UTC] capstonegaming: its sad to see ppl like phil being phased out by google
[2017-02-23 19:31:56 UTC] capstonegaming: theyre privatizing youtube so if u want that to be ur job ur gonna need to have a corporae sponsorship u shill for constantly otherwise youtube wont make sure ur okay
[2017-02-23 19:32:26 UTC] capstonegaming: influencing thousands of people will come at a price
[2017-02-23 19:33:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Hopefully it's just a mistake from Machinma/Google's side
[2017-02-23 19:33:54 UTC] capstonegaming: i dont think its a mistake its a sink or swim market control shit
[2017-02-23 19:34:39 UTC] capstonegaming: He seemed really mad dude
[2017-02-23 19:34:45 UTC] capstonegaming: im watching him right now
[2017-02-23 19:34:53 UTC] capstonegaming: seems like seriously afraid
[2017-02-23 19:35:10 UTC] theycallmejimbob: anyone would though if your earnings got a 35% cut
[2017-02-23 19:36:05 UTC] capstonegaming: you cant make youtube pay ppl for being popular tho
[2017-02-23 19:36:13 UTC] capstonegaming: thats THEIR side of things
[2017-02-23 19:36:19 UTC] capstonegaming: their opinion
[2017-02-23 19:37:21 UTC] capstonegaming: DSP almost has 200k subs on youtube. So is youtube responsible for paying phil for pulling in views for their ad program? or does phil need a sponsor as a foundation
[2017-02-23 19:38:03 UTC] capstonegaming: if i were phil a HUGE aspect of business is selling out
[2017-02-23 19:38:33 UTC] bethe2670: phil will be fine just watch
[2017-02-23 19:38:40 UTC] capstonegaming: Idk man
[2017-02-23 19:38:56 UTC] capstonegaming: its the patrons that keep him afloat not youtube
[2017-02-23 19:39:07 UTC] capstonegaming: so its a sugar daddy situation
[2017-02-23 19:39:36 UTC] capstonegaming: he needs to sell that fuckin coondo
[2017-02-23 19:39:42 UTC] capstonegaming: condo*
[2017-02-23 19:40:13 UTC] capstonegaming: i was gonna donate but i ate that money today for lunch
[2017-02-23 19:40:57 UTC] capstonegaming: he needs a brand relaunch and a different focus moving forward bc this techbubble gonna bust
[2017-02-23 19:41:19 UTC] capstonegaming: games cost oo much to make and when they are theyre heavily copied from others
[2017-02-23 19:42:06 UTC] bethe2670: watch when he is still here doing the exact same thing next year
[2017-02-23 19:42:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I hope so bethe
[2017-02-23 19:42:18 UTC] capstonegaming: phil liked my tweet of a tshirt design
[2017-02-23 19:42:40 UTC] capstonegaming: A Prinny saying Aww come on dood
[2017-02-23 19:43:06 UTC] capstonegaming: if he can make a DSPrinny logo and trademark it he could be in business
[2017-02-23 19:43:21 UTC] bethe2670: phil is just jumping on the t-shirt bandwagon finally because all other youtubers have shirts so its about time
[2017-02-23 19:43:35 UTC] freshjiivetv: but he's done shirts before?
[2017-02-23 19:43:41 UTC] freshjiivetv: so how is that jumping on a bandwagon
[2017-02-23 19:43:42 UTC] capstonegaming: T spring yeah
[2017-02-23 19:43:49 UTC] capstonegaming: i have him talking about it in another window
[2017-02-23 19:44:15 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he needs the potential income bethe it's not about jumping on the bandwagon.
[2017-02-23 19:44:20 UTC] bethe2670: i forgot he done shirts before
[2017-02-23 19:44:29 UTC] capstonegaming: DSP t shirts hmmmm i dont think ppl would bite
[2017-02-23 19:44:30 UTC] freshjiivetv: pretty sure he's done them a few times now
[2017-02-23 19:44:46 UTC] capstonegaming: even with DSPrinny or "The incident"
[2017-02-23 19:45:19 UTC] capstonegaming: i buy blank lands end pocket t shirts
[2017-02-23 19:45:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: maybe he could include the t shirts as one of his goals on patreon
[2017-02-23 19:45:50 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob its going to be like everyone buys the shirts at first then over time when everyone has bought it then he won't get no money from it unless he makes new designs
[2017-02-23 19:45:51 UTC] capstonegaming: ^ maybe but to profit itd have to be a big contirbution
[2017-02-23 19:46:02 UTC] capstonegaming: 20$ donation? tshirt
[2017-02-23 19:46:08 UTC] capstonegaming: that wouldnt be profit tho
[2017-02-23 19:46:17 UTC] capstonegaming: 30$ donation get a t shirt
[2017-02-23 19:46:25 UTC] capstonegaming: idk
[2017-02-23 19:46:39 UTC] bethe2670: people wouldnt do that
[2017-02-23 19:46:40 UTC] capstonegaming: this is why stock markets exist
[2017-02-23 19:46:51 UTC] capstonegaming: the DSP brand is at a low right now
[2017-02-23 19:46:52 UTC] bethe2670: he puts shirts out then people would buy
[2017-02-23 19:46:59 UTC] capstonegaming: how do we inflate the value of DSP
[2017-02-23 19:47:13 UTC] bethe2670: put it on patreon for 20 bucks and he MIGHT make a shirt naaaah
[2017-02-23 19:47:28 UTC] capstonegaming: his history with project 7 is keeping consumers away
[2017-02-23 19:47:40 UTC] capstonegaming: nobody came away from that happy
[2017-02-23 19:47:50 UTC] capstonegaming: well phil did with a bmw but i digress
[2017-02-23 19:48:10 UTC] retrocerberus: dspCowboy cheer30
[2017-02-23 19:48:31 UTC] capstonegaming: how can we improve his business....he needs a relaunch like a NEW type of business
[2017-02-23 19:48:56 UTC] capstonegaming: 200k audience could be leveraged for sponsorships from kickstart or maybe even sony (pipedream)
[2017-02-23 19:49:21 UTC] capstonegaming: but his audience could be used to make investors invest
[2017-02-23 19:49:34 UTC] bethe2670: he records vids for youtube, vlogs and other series and reviews and viewer submissions THAT is his business and he won't change it why would he
[2017-02-23 19:49:39 UTC] capstonegaming: 200k gamers what do u wanna sell to them? Ill put a word in....easy money
[2017-02-23 19:50:11 UTC] capstonegaming: the patron vote looked like none of those ppl were alive in the mid 2000s
[2017-02-23 19:50:19 UTC] capstonegaming: all the games were modern current gen
[2017-02-23 19:50:28 UTC] capstonegaming: nobody will watch him play them
[2017-02-23 19:50:47 UTC] capstonegaming: if he played shitty games nobody ever heard of then yeah of course ppl will watch
[2017-02-23 19:50:58 UTC] bethe2670: 200k viewers and only like 5k are ACTIVE
[2017-02-23 19:51:08 UTC] capstonegaming: the games the patrons voted for are all mainstream popular games ppl will shrug off
[2017-02-23 19:51:17 UTC] capstonegaming: XD
[2017-02-23 19:51:37 UTC] capstonegaming: yeah did u see te audience that disappeared on that yakuza stream?
[2017-02-23 19:51:47 UTC] capstonegaming: 150 ppl just vanished in an instant
[2017-02-23 19:51:49 UTC] lordpuggington: I think the whole youtube bubble has burst
[2017-02-23 19:52:11 UTC] bethe2670: 200k viewers yet barely 500 on a stream
[2017-02-23 19:52:12 UTC] capstonegaming: like he had a schedule right he went over that shedule and as soon as he did 150 ppl left in a matter of minutes
[2017-02-23 19:52:25 UTC] darksydephil: no
[2017-02-23 19:52:32 UTC] darksydephil: that was that idiot invading the stream
[2017-02-23 19:52:34 UTC] darksydephil: not legit viewers lol
[2017-02-23 19:52:39 UTC] capstonegaming: oh okay
[2017-02-23 19:52:45 UTC] darksydephil: it was like 200 followers of some random guy invading streams that day
[2017-02-23 19:52:55 UTC] lordpuggington: Hey Phil even Boogie2988 is struggling and he has 3 million subs on youtube
[2017-02-23 19:52:59 UTC] capstonegaming: yeah phil thinking about how to relaunch this so ur business can be fruitful and less stressful
[2017-02-23 19:53:10 UTC] bethe2670: yeah i know phil and it sucked

[2017-02-23 19:53:17 UTC] encelor: NieR
[2017-02-23 19:53:32 UTC] darksydephil: Boogie is not "struggling." Maybe he's making less money but when you get 1 million views on each video you put out, you're rolling in dough. As in, he's making probably around 500k a year
[2017-02-23 19:53:45 UTC] bethe2670: phil will keep doing what he is good at and he will WIN this fight
[2017-02-23 19:54:05 UTC] encelor: if only phil played Nier automata instead of for honor
[2017-02-23 19:54:09 UTC] capstonegaming: heres an example phil.

[2017-02-23 20:03:21 UTC] aglet57: Well you're in your 30s. Different generations

[2017-02-23 20:03:25 UTC] capstonegaming: somebody needs to make the DSPrinny
[2017-02-23 20:03:40 UTC] darksydephil: DX: E3 was always public for a price, actually. they just never talked about it publicly lol
[2017-02-23 20:03:40 UTC] lordpuggington: Meet and greets at local game stores?
[2017-02-23 20:03:40 UTC] capstonegaming: but somehow avoid lawsuit from NIS america or whoever makes disgaea
[2017-02-23 20:03:53 UTC] darksydephil: teespring doesn't allow copyrighted characters
[2017-02-23 20:03:54 UTC] darksydephil: so thats a no go
[2017-02-23 20:03:58 UTC] capstonegaming: (facepalm)
[2017-02-23 20:04:05 UTC] darksydephil: it'd have to be me, my face/body etc with my slogans etc
[2017-02-23 20:04:10 UTC] capstonegaming: okay make it a different kinda bird
[2017-02-23 20:04:16 UTC] dxfreedom: I never knew that :(
[2017-02-23 20:04:22 UTC] capstonegaming: hmm( thinking)
[2017-02-23 20:04:46 UTC] bethe2670: phil make a shirt with your cum face and fireworks around it and yaaaaaasss as the word
[2017-02-23 20:04:47 UTC] eternia_forever: Phil is you r body ready though that is the question
[2017-02-23 20:04:47 UTC] capstonegaming: not gonna have ur face thats idol worship
[2017-02-23 20:04:52 UTC] bethe2670: i think it would def sell
[2017-02-23 20:04:56 UTC] capstonegaming: need something.....cuddly
[2017-02-23 20:04:57 UTC] darksydephil: ok setting up the stream now
[2017-02-23 20:05:34 UTC] capstonegaming: what if instead of a prinny u just north korea that shit and just make it a woodpecker just tear it down to its core principles then redraw it as asomething similar but not he same
[2017-02-23 20:05:40 UTC] bethe2670: maybe another shirt could be your angry face and saying THIS IS BULLSHIT on it
[2017-02-23 20:05:42 UTC] bethe2670: :D
[2017-02-23 20:05:48 UTC] capstonegaming: XD
[2017-02-23 20:05:49 UTC] soulrider95: Oh shit I gotta remember my JP PSN login
[2017-02-23 20:05:49 UTC] capstonegaming: HAAHAHAH^
[2017-02-23 20:05:51 UTC] sardarkh: Instead of shirts, I'd just focus on twitch and partnering with channels.
[2017-02-23 20:05:54 UTC] soulrider95: NieR Automata Kreygasm
[2017-02-23 20:06:17 UTC] capstonegaming: the DSPrinny needs to be made tho
[2017-02-23 20:06:17 UTC] aglet57: Could you try streaming live less, @DarksydePhil ? Right before you went back to Twitch, you were going to stream less to get YT views and for streams to be special. Couldn't you reduce live streams for a week or two and see if that leads to more views?
[2017-02-23 20:06:28 UTC] capstonegaming: a mascot must be created
[2017-02-23 20:06:40 UTC] akioartorius: Hello chat, Hello Phil, how are all of you?
[2017-02-23 20:06:45 UTC] bethe2670: OR the glitch one with Bugs on it saying bugged Shirt mechanics
[2017-02-23 20:06:46 UTC] darksydephil: i think, if the common viewer contributed with just a cheer here, a sub here, buying a shirt every once in a while, doing a $1 patreon pledge. we'd be fine. issue is, from 2008-2015 it was just "watch and i'll succeed, no worries about anything else" because i was still in one of the most lucrative YouTube contracts possible. then all that went away and people aren't used to the "capitalist" mentality when watching my stuff, because for 7 years it wasn't necessary. now it VERY much is
[2017-02-23 20:06:49 UTC] soulrider95: Darksydephil, NieR Automata is out on JP PSN with an english option, you going to play it early?
[2017-02-23 20:06:55 UTC] darksydephil: i mean, shit, did i ever advertise anything pre-2015? nope.
[2017-02-23 20:06:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: good thanks akioartorius and yourself
[2017-02-23 20:07:01 UTC] capstonegaming: Tkoh sounds like boxing how bout kangaroo? no too australian why not an anthropomorphic kangarroo with a prinny hat
[2017-02-23 20:07:25 UTC] goldencolts: wher is NEO
[2017-02-23 20:07:35 UTC] akioartorius: Good. Birthday and all so good. Don't know how I did on my test though
[2017-02-23 20:07:36 UTC] capstonegaming: how bout a prinny with dsp features?
[2017-02-23 20:07:48 UTC] capstonegaming: i say prinny but i mean (insert trademark here)
[2017-02-23 20:07:55 UTC] darksydephil: think about it. while iw as just gaming on YouTube for so long, pretty much EVERYBODY else who was successful had to work partnership deals, advertisement, sponsorship and shill products etc
[2017-02-23 20:07:56 UTC] bethe2670: what the fuck is a PRINNY
[2017-02-23 20:08:03 UTC] sardarkh: You didn't effectively capitalize on your potential back then. Now you should keep eggs in more baskets. Using twitch more is a good way, if YT screws up.
[2017-02-23 20:08:03 UTC] eternia_forever: phil make that patreon 50 perk on goin not just one time personal videos
[2017-02-23 20:08:08 UTC] darksydephil: i was lucky enough to not have to dot hat, but now sadly it looks like stuff is changing
[2017-02-23 20:08:15 UTC] capstonegaming: ^
[2017-02-23 20:08:18 UTC] soulrider95: I mean you're sponsored by Lootcrate now so
[2017-02-23 20:08:28 UTC] capstonegaming: i saw that vlog and it seemed like rED ALERT status
[2017-02-23 20:08:32 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @bethe2670, Disgaea Franchise and a spin off series
[2017-02-23 20:08:41 UTC] darksydephil: sponsored by lootcrate, and i make like $100 bucks amonth from it lol. no lie, almost nobody uses the referral code
[2017-02-23 20:08:48 UTC] darksydephil: even though i plug the fuck out of it
[2017-02-23 20:08:53 UTC] capstonegaming: lootcrate and that great
[2017-02-23 20:08:53 UTC] soulrider95: $100 is better than $0
[2017-02-23 20:08:56 UTC] darksydephil: thats what i mean though. people have no idea how important that stuff is
[2017-02-23 20:08:57 UTC] capstonegaming: ^
[2017-02-23 20:09:01 UTC] eternia_forever: they want to give you 50 a month you make a personal video each month they give you that @DarksydePhil
[2017-02-23 20:09:09 UTC] darksydephil: they just think "Watch and phil will succeed!" sadly, not anymore.
[2017-02-23 20:09:10 UTC] soulrider95: I mean $100 is nothing to scoff at
[2017-02-23 20:09:20 UTC] darksydephil: eternia, thats exactly how it works
[2017-02-23 20:09:20 UTC] eternia_forever: not just once
[2017-02-23 20:09:26 UTC] darksydephil: its not just one video
[2017-02-23 20:09:34 UTC] darksydephil: if the pledge continues, the vids continue
[2017-02-23 20:09:35 UTC] capstonegaming: yeah thats what bethe kept saying
[2017-02-23 20:09:41 UTC] capstonegaming: "hell be here another year im not worried"
[2017-02-23 20:09:44 UTC] capstonegaming: not a good attitude
[2017-02-23 20:09:47 UTC] eternia_forever: its says one time perk though doesnt it ?
[2017-02-23 20:09:52 UTC] soulrider95: Yeah it does
[2017-02-23 20:09:53 UTC] capstonegaming: ideas are free
[2017-02-23 20:09:56 UTC] twitchnotify: 1 viewer resubscribed while you were away!
[2017-02-23 20:10:02 UTC] akioartorius: live?
[2017-02-23 20:10:07 UTC] darksydephil: thats exactly right CapstoneGaming , the fact of the matter is, that wont be the case shortly if poeple don't actually take REAL action for once
[2017-02-23 20:10:10 UTC] soulrider95: "PLEASE NOTE: This is a one-time perk and is not recurring. However, if you pledge this amount you will receive ALL lower perk goals for that month as well! (as long as you haven't already received one that isn't recurring, that is)."
[2017-02-23 20:10:23 UTC] soulrider95: It says one-time so you might wanna update that
[2017-02-23 20:10:48 UTC] darksydephil: people make fun of me for saying $1 a month helps me but is nothing to the common viewer. but it's 100% true. if every stream viewer and every youtube viewer gave $1 a month, i wouldn't even NEED ad revenue. and it's LITERALLY NOTHING to give a dollar
[2017-02-23 20:10:48 UTC] humpiershaggy: Word dogs atpHorns atpGasm atpHorns
[2017-02-23 20:10:49 UTC] capstonegaming: is there ANY way you could do the easiest thing and get a job? i mean i know you dont wanna hear that but u need to drive up the demand for DSP then only give them a sip
[2017-02-23 20:11:01 UTC] capstonegaming: doesnt even have to be a real job
[2017-02-23 20:11:12 UTC] capstonegaming: just tell ppl ur busy and theyll wanna see more of u
[2017-02-23 20:11:27 UTC] capstonegaming: thiis is in stream chat and immoral of course but still
[2017-02-23 20:11:30 UTC] capstonegaming: welcome to capitalism
[2017-02-23 20:11:35 UTC] humpiershaggy: Link up Patreon and lets get dollaring then
[2017-02-23 20:11:37 UTC] lordpuggington: my company is hiring financial analysts we're in downtown Seattle
[2017-02-23 20:11:38 UTC] darksydephil: impossible CapstoneGaming . we only have one car and cannot afford another. and i cannot keep up with youtube and do a job at the same time. it'd revert back to how it was from 2008-2010 and i can't maintain the business playing 1-2 games a month
[2017-02-23 20:11:38 UTC] bethe2670: @Ginosaji48 is watching, who da fuck is that? Kappa
[2017-02-23 20:11:44 UTC] darksydephil: it would be even worse than it is now
[2017-02-23 20:11:44 UTC] axejaw: a dollar a month
[2017-02-23 20:11:49 UTC] ginosaji48: /me kicks bethe
[2017-02-23 20:11:55 UTC] capstonegaming: shat about the condo in conneticut?
[2017-02-23 20:11:59 UTC] capstonegaming: is that out the way?
[2017-02-23 20:12:09 UTC] eternia_forever: Atten Phil after your 50 goal it says this is a one time perk and Not reoccuring CHANGE THAT WORDING @DarksydePhil
[2017-02-23 20:12:13 UTC] goldencolts: to be fair, there are 95 million people out of the workforce, any money isn't nothing to most americans- not anymore. you'd have to go back to pre 1970s
[2017-02-23 20:12:18 UTC] capstonegaming: the detractors were showing it as sold last time i was doing recon
[2017-02-23 20:12:20 UTC] darksydephil: condo is in the process of being short sold. meaning my credit will be fucked for years but it'll be around $1500 im not pissing away monthly
[2017-02-23 20:12:21 UTC] bethe2670: dragin and pepsicola hello
[2017-02-23 20:12:32 UTC] capstonegaming: ^ GREAT

[2017-02-23 20:12:37 UTC] capstonegaming: thats a start
[2017-02-23 20:12:39 UTC] darksydephil: detractors are fucking retards
[2017-02-23 20:12:49 UTC] darksydephil: its' in a short sale process. the bank that holds the mortgage might tell me to fuck off
[2017-02-23 20:12:58 UTC] capstonegaming: "The smallest shits smell the worst" remember that phil
[2017-02-23 20:13:02 UTC] podusmonens: hello bethe
[2017-02-23 20:13:18 UTC] lordpuggington: if they do allow a short sale your credit is wrecked for a while
[2017-02-23 20:13:18 UTC] darksydephil: but it needs to happen. there's no way i can piss away that money anymore and my aunt moved out some 6 months ago
[2017-02-23 20:13:26 UTC] capstonegaming: they might be no lifing retards but theyre still dangerous and pieces on the board
[2017-02-23 20:13:30 UTC] darksydephil: yeah myc redit will be shit for a few years
[2017-02-23 20:13:48 UTC] aglet57: Your credit, car insurance, loans, all of it will be in a bad way for 5-10 years
[2017-02-23 20:13:53 UTC] capstonegaming: as long as u can remain secure in washingotn
[2017-02-23 20:14:01 UTC] podusmonens: 10 years?
[2017-02-23 20:14:02 UTC] darksydephil: um no. existing loans and car insurance don't go up lol

[2017-02-23 20:14:38 UTC] mfd4419: What car do you have in mind
[2017-02-23 20:14:39 UTC] aglet57: No, but if you change your car insurance a new carrier is going to do a credit check. And when you get a new car lease, again, new credit check.
[2017-02-23 20:14:42 UTC] cherubimknight: Hey Phil is threatening Machinima good for your "business" too?
[2017-02-23 20:14:43 UTC] soulrider95: @DarksydePhil, what kind of car?
[2017-02-23 20:14:45 UTC] twitchstuzster: Hello from a windy UK :)

[2017-02-23 20:14:57 UTC] darksydephil: i didn't threaten machinima??
[2017-02-23 20:14:57 UTC] capstonegaming: gotta put all that gold into the business furnace and let everything else be secondary

[2017-02-23 20:15:31 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I forgot about it bethe2670 thanks

[2017-02-23 20:18:58 UTC] bethe2670: hello delta
[2017-02-23 20:19:00 UTC] capstonegaming: in the vlog it sounded like after the reneg from machinima things got a lot worse
[2017-02-23 20:19:11 UTC] darksydephil: of course
[2017-02-23 20:19:13 UTC] hapticbabyman: sounds like machinama's fucked you over, why stay with them?
[2017-02-23 20:19:15 UTC] encelor: @DarksydePhil don't give them too much attention
[2017-02-23 20:19:23 UTC] darksydephil: i went from guaranteed income based on views to a fluctuating income based on ad revenue. its awful
[2017-02-23 20:19:27 UTC] capstonegaming: the only sponsor bridge besides machinima
[2017-02-23 20:19:37 UTC] capstonegaming: All because of false copyright strikes?
[2017-02-23 20:19:43 UTC] capstonegaming: phil you MIGHT need to lawyer up
[2017-02-23 20:19:47 UTC] darksydephil: and machinima has the best terms! Thats the funniest part, im making mor ewith them than i would anywhere else
[2017-02-23 20:19:56 UTC] darksydephil: i alreayd looked into it, nobody else even compares
[2017-02-23 20:19:58 UTC] deltaforce355: its weird that every month this year youtube fucks you
[2017-02-23 20:20:00 UTC] deltaforce355: weird
[2017-02-23 20:20:01 UTC] aglet57: @CapstoneGaming Machinima also phased out that legacy contract.
[2017-02-23 20:20:10 UTC] hapticbabyman: well, that isn't very good news then tbh
[2017-02-23 20:20:21 UTC] bethe2670: youtube FUCKS everyone
[2017-02-23 20:20:21 UTC] capstonegaming: you might need to lawyer up ppl attacked ur business and were succesful
[2017-02-23 20:20:21 UTC] freshjiivetv: Im curious as to why you even need a partnership company? many large channels exist today without them and then you don't lose a cut of your revenue
[2017-02-23 20:20:24 UTC] eternia_forever: dspHmm
[2017-02-23 20:20:42 UTC] galactic_reptile: Any news on whether this is fucking only you specifically?
[2017-02-23 20:20:54 UTC] fatherofpoordaughter: Phil im sorry to ask you this. I know your relationship is not working out well. So if you REALLY need money, you could sell me your daughter. Also there is no cure for chronic nasal drip and ***
[2017-02-23 20:20:57 UTC] capstonegaming: i think theres a court case here and publicity to boot
[2017-02-23 20:21:03 UTC] podusmonens: of course bigger channels dot need partnership
[2017-02-23 20:21:04 UTC] deltaforce355: also, if youtube is gone, what phil will do?
[2017-02-23 20:21:05 UTC] theycallmealazybeggar: I sit on my fat ass all day d00d it's a tedious stressful life I live, I get no relaxation time *snort*

[2017-02-23 20:21:19 UTC] capstonegaming: I think phil should lawyer up
[2017-02-23 20:21:21 UTC] triflamingo: ice poseidon made you TriHard Cx
[2017-02-23 20:21:21 UTC] aglet57: @CapstoneGaming Hard to prove it concretely. We all know what we know, but a court could also see YT and say that popularity fluctuates and that you can't pinpoint any one reasons.
[2017-02-23 20:21:23 UTC] hapticbabyman: if they're the best, and they've fucked you over, that doesn't leave any other sponsors. you might need to start sponsoring game playthroughs or something like that
[2017-02-23 20:21:24 UTC] freshjiivetv: No channel needs partnership lol. It's a relic from YT past.
[2017-02-23 20:21:29 UTC] darksydephil: Machinima has clout with YouTube. numerous times they've helped clear up copyright issues and other stuff fo rme
[2017-02-23 20:21:30 UTC] goldencolts: and hit the gym?
[2017-02-23 20:21:33 UTC] popsicolo: Nightbot timed that guy out before anyone could even read their message LUL

[2017-02-23 20:21:48 UTC] saielponpon: I'd say he still has Twitch but it doesn't seem to be big enough for hin
[2017-02-23 20:21:50 UTC] sardarkh: Companies that purchase ad can request specific quality ratio for the outlet in which the ad may show up. Lower ad revenue during the better months, with the same ad views, simply means that you have been flagged as a bad outlet for the heavier spending adsense companies.
[2017-02-23 20:21:51 UTC] saielponpon: *him
[2017-02-23 20:21:52 UTC] hapticbabyman: yeah but machinima's not helping with the bottom line that much, clearly
[2017-02-23 20:21:52 UTC] darksydephil: and because im with machinima i do NOT get any issues with copyrigth matches or content ID. that's a HUGE one
[2017-02-23 20:21:53 UTC] dxfreedom: nighbot was on point
[2017-02-23 20:21:58 UTC] popsicolo: !thebot

[2017-02-23 20:22:08 UTC] darksydephil: if i just uploaded without being in a managed partnership, half of my videos would get content ID matched and no ads would show
[2017-02-23 20:22:08 UTC] capstonegaming: okay. but what about the bills
[2017-02-23 20:22:10 UTC] mfd4419: That sucks
[2017-02-23 20:22:22 UTC] freshjiivetv: but since YT somewhat fixed the problems with copyright maybe a partnership company isnt as beneficial
[2017-02-23 20:22:24 UTC] hapticbabyman: is all of those bonuses worth more than getting the money you deserve b/c machinima 's contract sucks?
[2017-02-23 20:22:33 UTC] aglet57: @CapstoneGaming What about the bills?
[2017-02-23 20:22:36 UTC] absol_zero: Hey @DarksydePhil I have the best advice for you, go get a REAL job and try to be a man, you fat fuck
[2017-02-23 20:22:42 UTC] saielponpon: Collabs maybe?
[2017-02-23 20:22:43 UTC] capstonegaming: how can they be shaved
[2017-02-23 20:22:44 UTC] darksydephil: its not copyright issues, its content ID. completely different
[2017-02-23 20:22:55 UTC] hapticbabyman: rock in a hard place situation, basically
[2017-02-23 20:22:58 UTC] libraking87: Yawn. man im tired been up since 5 and im still at work.. Man oh well im not complaining atleast i make 13 an hour
[2017-02-23 20:23:04 UTC] darksydephil: wtf, i literally just said machinima has the BEST contract lol. how can you say it sucks
[2017-02-23 20:23:07 UTC] aglet57: @CapstoneGaming Most of them can't. Needs the internet set up he has.
[2017-02-23 20:23:12 UTC] freshjiivetv: I've successfully fought content ID matches without partnership Im sure you could
[2017-02-23 20:23:21 UTC] aglet57: He's getting a more reasonable car in June
[2017-02-23 20:23:24 UTC] mfd4419: Who me
[2017-02-23 20:23:32 UTC] dv3r: Jesus I'm not even a huge fan of dsp most of the time but some of the haters he attacts are sad as fuck
[2017-02-23 20:23:35 UTC] saielponpon: He probably meant that Machinima sucks as a company but not the contract
[2017-02-23 20:23:39 UTC] skyangel4life: @DarksydePhil i dunno what to say man. Ive followed you since senior year and im about to get my 2nd degree. Youve helped me through so much shit and hard times i hope this all works out. Your my flippin idol man.
[2017-02-23 20:23:55 UTC] hapticbabyman: i mean in terms of you getting the money; their terms don't sound all that good for making money. the content ID stuff and such yeah, but they've cut you out of a lot of revenue when they switched you to ad-based
[2017-02-23 20:23:57 UTC] capstonegaming: this is tough puzzle
[2017-02-23 20:24:08 UTC] edinjadadic: all problem could be solved with text to speech, just seperated from youtube,

[2017-02-23 22:44:27 UTC] ginosaji48: :D
[2017-02-23 22:44:28 UTC] tenpiece32: @DXFreeDoM the internet has so much info about a simple leak

[2017-02-23 22:44:42 UTC] capstonegaming: i thought it was a break
[2017-02-23 22:44:46 UTC] yacherdy: His sink died
[2017-02-23 22:44:48 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah. If it is just a bagatelle it's really a waste calling a plumber
[2017-02-23 22:44:50 UTC] beegdongjhon: CapstoneGaming, the proper answer would be move on and do this as a hobby since he can't afford to.
[2017-02-23 22:44:54 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil's sink is glitched
[2017-02-23 22:44:58 UTC] popsicolo: IT'

[2017-02-23 22:45:23 UTC] ginosaji48: bugged house mechanics
[2017-02-23 22:45:27 UTC] dxfreedom: Sink is a beginners trap
[2017-02-23 22:45:32 UTC] ewojo: did Phil cancel the rest of the stream?
[2017-02-23 22:45:36 UTC] ginosaji48: yes
[2017-02-23 22:45:39 UTC] yacherdy: we're gonna have a video game crisis like in 1983 Kappa
[2017-02-23 22:45:42 UTC] capstonegaming: games will come out but intrugue and interest will wane much like it did 30 years ago
[2017-02-23 22:45:42 UTC] tenpiece32: @DXFreeDoM of course there is
[2017-02-23 22:45:44 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I'm thinking Phil's business is unsustainable, unfortunately, I've enjoyed watching him over the years but it's over for him as a full time youtuber
[2017-02-23 22:45:46 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: take a picture put it on twitter and ask for advice if it is easy. You don't hire a expensive plumber but fix it yourself
[2017-02-23 22:45:48 UTC] podusmonens: the sink is a scrub - online pattern combos only
[2017-02-23 22:45:49 UTC] capstonegaming: skateboaridng is in for its 2nd big crash as well
[2017-02-23 22:45:55 UTC] popsicolo: The stream in his sink is more important.

[2017-02-23 22:46:08 UTC] ginosaji48: fix it with a tape and keep playing, problem solved
[2017-02-23 22:46:18 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Phil's sink is broken, he has to stop stream to clean up the water covering his kitchen
[2017-02-23 22:46:20 UTC] mc_burnout26: hmm for some reason I cant get the stream to play for me.
[2017-02-23 22:46:21 UTC] capstonegaming: you look over and its all stuff you vaguely recognized because innovation will only go so far
[2017-02-23 22:46:23 UTC] popsicolo: Plug the leak with bacon grease KappaHD

[2017-02-23 22:53:31 UTC] tenpiece32: the paid online was the no. reason

[2017-02-23 22:58:49 UTC] manyperegrine81: Did anyone clip that?
[2017-02-23 22:58:58 UTC] tenpiece32: DSP says plumbing but think the guy is not doing so well now
[2017-02-23 22:58:58 UTC] ibedavey: Phil only plays current games
[2017-02-23 22:59:04 UTC] ibedavey: and since Xbox One has none
[2017-02-23 22:59:07 UTC] ibedavey: he doesn't use it
[2017-02-23 22:59:28 UTC] mc_burnout26: even though xbox one usually has less issues with games aka less crashes
[2017-02-23 22:59:36 UTC] ibedavey: never heard that before
[2017-02-23 22:59:42 UTC] ibedavey: from anyone ever
[2017-02-23 22:59:57 UTC] manyperegrine81: I watched his 1 hour video complaint video last night.
[2017-02-23 22:59:58 UTC] mc_burnout26: Well that is what I noticed
[2017-02-23 23:00:15 UTC] mc_burnout26: I have FFXV 1 entire game
[2017-02-23 23:00:22 UTC] mc_burnout26: and well DSP had many so.....
[2017-02-23 23:00:23 UTC] manyperegrine81: Like Jesus Christ man, is he that financially unstable...
[2017-02-23 23:00:27 UTC] ibedavey: had ann Xbox One and it was a nightmare

[2017-02-23 23:00:42 UTC] ibedavey: no crashes whatsoever
[2017-02-23 23:01:12 UTC] manyperegrine81: That's because Phil uses the shit out of that PS4 console
[2017-02-23 23:01:17 UTC] mc_burnout26: I guess it depends on the peoples system then. My friends would crash every 5 hours or so
[2017-02-23 23:03:59 UTC] ibedavey: also I'm sorry but 2017 for Xbox is horrendous
[2017-02-23 23:04:02 UTC] tenpiece32: Well maybe Nintendo will come back again
[2017-02-23 23:04:36 UTC] tenpiece32: going to watch the Boogie vid about now seems like he does not like it
