[2017-02-12 20:33:31 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The idea they may be going with is Bray vs Orton as they have teased Orton RKOing Bray a couple of times
[2017-02-12 20:33:39 UTC] ginosaji48: oh and Nikki Bella not retiring at WM
[2017-02-12 20:33:49 UTC] xgameofpwns: NOOO I need my daily dose of raw unedited Phil

[2017-02-12 20:38:04 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Phil taking his pre workout before streaming
[2017-02-12 20:38:05 UTC] blue_blur64: @Coldkiller86, He said on twitter that because of personal stuff the stream might not happen
[2017-02-12 20:38:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: 8 hours a go
[2017-02-12 20:38:32 UTC] blue_blur64: I have a feeling he's still asleep
[2017-02-12 20:38:37 UTC] coldkiller86: i Know i usaly tends to be late but not this late
[2017-02-12 20:38:37 UTC] snipertheladiesman: hmm... guess no stream then
[2017-02-12 20:38:39 UTC] skooma_dealer: Simple sleep wont help a complex issue
[2017-02-12 20:38:45 UTC] skooma_dealer: He needs a doctors help
[2017-02-12 20:38:45 UTC] shotinthedeep: !Phil
[2017-02-12 20:38:48 UTC] coldkiller86: he i mean
[2017-02-12 20:39:02 UTC] shotinthedeep: hmmmm....that didn't work
[2017-02-12 20:39:04 UTC] blue_blur64: Well we don't even know what the problem is, so don't assume it's a big issue
[2017-02-12 20:39:09 UTC] ginosaji48: ok its cancelled
[2017-02-12 20:39:11 UTC] marpat1993: Wouldn't leanna inform us in her twitter
[2017-02-12 20:39:13 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he can't afford the to visit the doctors Skooma they're 500 bucks a visit
[2017-02-12 20:39:18 UTC] blue_blur64: Could've just been a bad stomach ache :P
[2017-02-12 20:39:26 UTC] shotinthedeep: not that much now that he has insurance jimbob
[2017-02-12 20:39:26 UTC] aglet57: His co-pay is $500? Tjat
[2017-02-12 20:39:33 UTC] bethe2670: leanna wont do that
[2017-02-12 20:39:35 UTC] aglet57: That's crazy
[2017-02-12 20:39:42 UTC] shotinthedeep: Now it's like $150
[2017-02-12 20:39:46 UTC] theycallmejimbob: good point deep
[2017-02-12 20:39:50 UTC] shotinthedeep: I think that's what he said last
[2017-02-12 20:39:58 UTC] skooma_dealer: Oh so he is uninsured?
[2017-02-12 20:40:04 UTC] aglet57: I just went in for something and my doctor opted to call it a yearly physical instead. Didn't cost me a dime.
[2017-02-12 20:40:06 UTC] shotinthedeep: He got insurance this year
[2017-02-12 20:40:19 UTC] kg12228: yea he has better coverage. he can't be so nieve and say he keeps getting "the common cold" Leanna should have a talk with him
[2017-02-12 20:40:19 UTC] skooma_dealer: 150 is the price for people without it, I am chronically ill
[2017-02-12 20:40:26 UTC] podusmonens: jmon_1985 this isn't the first time
[2017-02-12 20:40:36 UTC] shotinthedeep: He did say he just looked at the website to see the price
[2017-02-12 20:40:42 UTC] shotinthedeep: So I dunno if he's misinforme
[2017-02-12 20:40:45 UTC] shotinthedeep: d
[2017-02-12 20:40:54 UTC] kg12228: yea he has better coverage I know last year his was awful
[2017-02-12 20:41:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: how much would it cost to get a flu jab
[2017-02-12 20:41:00 UTC] skooma_dealer: Getting this sick that much is a sign of somethign underlying like an infection that wont go away without proper antibiodics not saying it is but common sense tells me its bigger than a simple cold
[2017-02-12 20:41:09 UTC] aglet57: He should call someone to be sure. The website is ususally misinformation
[2017-02-12 20:41:21 UTC] blue_blur64: Again, don't make the assumption that it's a big problem
[2017-02-12 20:41:36 UTC] coldkiller86: weird thing i dont get we put up with this bullshit
[2017-02-12 20:41:47 UTC] shotinthedeep: He has gotten sick quite a bit, but it could just be a bunch of minor things
[2017-02-12 20:41:50 UTC] blue_blur64: We don't know what it is, and we can't tell Phil what to do with no information. He didn't even say he had a cold and everybody assumed that it was a cold
[2017-02-12 20:41:55 UTC] aglet57: Maybe get an air purifier for the office. Works wonders.
[2017-02-12 20:41:56 UTC] kg12228: it's one day he does this every day so if he needs a personal day for something he doesn't have to publicly announce it
[2017-02-12 20:42:05 UTC] aglet57: @blue_blur64 True
[2017-02-12 20:42:19 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah most people have a day of in a week and it's no big deal
[2017-02-12 20:42:22 UTC] blue_blur64: All he said was that he was sick and couldn't sleep
[2017-02-12 20:42:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: sorry Silent if it is a cold he should look into getting a flu jab
[2017-02-12 20:42:40 UTC] shotinthedeep: Yeah, he didn't even say he was sick
[2017-02-12 20:42:45 UTC] shotinthedeep: just that he wasn't feeling well
[2017-02-12 20:42:56 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: his schedule is brutal
[2017-02-12 20:43:09 UTC] aglet57: I think it's ok to be concerned with his well being though. We're fans and to some extent friends. Hope he's ok soon.
[2017-02-12 20:43:37 UTC] kg12228: @aglet57 agreed. maybe it's a family issue
[2017-02-12 20:43:39 UTC] aglet57: But streaming is not a neccisity over your health, that's for sure
[2017-02-12 20:43:40 UTC] ginosaji48: phil will turn heel tomorrow
[2017-02-12 20:43:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you mean he hasn't already Gino :P
[2017-02-12 20:43:58 UTC] aglet57: Even if his "health" is just need some actual rest.
[2017-02-12 20:44:22 UTC] aglet57: Brother is stressed out 24/7. A day to just chill goes a long way.
[2017-02-12 20:44:30 UTC] shotinthedeep: Nice tweet bethe :D
[2017-02-12 20:44:33 UTC] ginosaji48: well, he's gonna approve the first ever *** montage so its basically like a heel turn
[2017-02-12 20:44:50 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: The bottom line is we don't know. He might be burned out, he might be sick, he might be a lot of things. There is nothing we can do anyways
[2017-02-12 20:45:10 UTC] kg12228: @ginosaji48 I think 3 DS montages are a bit much tho. the 1st two were extremely similar lol
[2017-02-12 20:45:14 UTC] aglet57: He should release the montage today just to have something out today anyway
[2017-02-12 20:45:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: what time is it now in Seattle?
[2017-02-12 20:45:33 UTC] aglet57: 12:45

[2017-02-12 20:52:01 UTC] podusmonens: he's stressed about losing money. like everyone predicted he would.. no offense
[2017-02-12 20:52:06 UTC] vypek: yeah. i didn't see all of primetime that week but got a second twitch notification. thought it was odd cause it usually just switches to a new game

[2017-02-12 21:03:47 UTC] phoenixrising2015: LOL Twitch just gave me the "Enjoying the stream?" icon during this situation.
[2017-02-12 21:03:53 UTC] taurusoxford: Oh sorry I made a joke about your hero
[2017-02-12 21:04:31 UTC] jmon_1985: Nah I just like proving ppl wrong
[2017-02-12 21:04:32 UTC] bethe2670: phil made the list?
[2017-02-12 21:04:37 UTC] leokira997: MAN DOWN
[2017-02-12 21:04:58 UTC] podusmonens: jmon are you phil's official defendant?
[2017-02-12 21:05:01 UTC] shotinthedeep: He made the list long ago bethe, remember gino is the leader of sok
[2017-02-12 21:05:14 UTC] marpat1993: I think we need to raid phils house
[2017-02-12 21:05:23 UTC] ginosaji48: phil will join us soon deep
[2017-02-12 21:05:26 UTC] podusmonens: we need to chill
[2017-02-12 21:05:35 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The list of Gino. Drink it in maaann.
[2017-02-12 21:05:43 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Everyone needs to get his phone number and call him Kappa
[2017-02-12 21:05:44 UTC] leokira997: twitch n chill?
[2017-02-12 21:05:49 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: So dsp is 'ill' again?
[2017-02-12 21:06:01 UTC] ginosaji48: he didnt say that
[2017-02-12 21:06:03 UTC] theycallmejimbob: we don't know for sure
[2017-02-12 21:06:04 UTC] kg12228: he took viagra so his pre stream fap is just long Kappa
[2017-02-12 21:06:11 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: no one knows the status of DSP for sure
[2017-02-12 21:06:13 UTC] leokira997: ^
[2017-02-12 21:06:15 UTC] jmon_1985: No I just can't stand when ppl talk pure BC s
[2017-02-12 21:06:21 UTC] leokira997: to both of those
[2017-02-12 21:06:32 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Wish he would update us at least
[2017-02-12 21:06:43 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: His twitter says he wasnt feeling great and stream is doubtful. Therefore 'ill' lol
[2017-02-12 21:06:46 UTC] podusmonens: he's sleeping
[2017-02-12 21:06:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: fuzzyblumpkinz, we're not allowed to speculate
[2017-02-12 21:07:00 UTC] podusmonens: that's what he did the last time
[2017-02-12 21:07:01 UTC] ginosaji48: so far he has only problems with getting some sleep, so the stream is canceled or delayed
[2017-02-12 21:07:07 UTC] podusmonens: no schtreem, no notification
[2017-02-12 21:07:26 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Hopefully he feels better when hes awake. And its clearly not speculation it literally says it on his twitter...
[2017-02-12 21:08:59 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Phil ‏@TheyCallMeDSP 9h9 hours agoMore Not asleep yet and not feeling well. Sunday's Nioh stream is uncertain as I need to be healthy and right now it's not looking good.10 replies 0 retweets 10 likesReply 10 Retweet Like 10
[2017-02-12 21:09:08 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: is what it says
[2017-02-12 21:09:24 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Been loving his Nioh streams so heres hoping he wakes up feeling fresh.
[2017-02-12 21:09:49 UTC] podusmonens: he was fine yesterday
[2017-02-12 21:10:16 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Well everyone feels well before they feel unwell
[2017-02-12 21:10:19 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Lol
[2017-02-12 21:10:24 UTC] podusmonens: in just a day he gets so sick he can't type a few words on twitter
[2017-02-12 21:10:24 UTC] kondekka: I heard he got cancer from reading twitch chat, dunno then whats up with him
[2017-02-12 21:10:44 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil ‏@TheyCallMeDSP 14hMore Today has already been a pretty stressful day...now the internet has completely crapped out while I just started uploading. WTF....
[2017-02-12 21:10:49 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: @podusmonens hes probably still asleep
[2017-02-12 21:11:10 UTC] theycallmejimbob: maybe his internet is gone again
[2017-02-12 21:11:17 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Maby he just had a drink to much then... that can also make you feel bad suddenly
[2017-02-12 21:11:25 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Just because his last tweet was 9 hours ago doesnt mean he got to sleep right after it. Could have been awake for another few hours.
[2017-02-12 21:11:35 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Who knows
[2017-02-12 21:11:51 UTC] royal_phalanx91: NOTE:Some personal stuff happened, sunday schedule not 100% guaranteed
[2017-02-12 21:11:53 UTC] kg12228: maybe he's having relationship issues
[2017-02-12 21:12:00 UTC] podusmonens: he has a phone and wifi in a nearby restaurant/bar/whatever, internet is not a problem for giving a notification on twitter
[2017-02-12 21:12:02 UTC] royal_phalanx91: that's what he said previously
[2017-02-12 21:12:06 UTC] aglet57: It is very odd for the most outspoken person on the Internet to suddenly go quiet though. Again, hope it's nothing serious.
[2017-02-12 21:12:30 UTC] aglet57: If it's just catching up on some ZZZs, good for him. He works every day.
[2017-02-12 21:12:38 UTC] podusmonens: nah aglet it's called not giving a fuck
[2017-02-12 21:12:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: well the same happened a few weeks ago because he slept it in
[2017-02-12 21:12:44 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Most people are quiet when they sleep
[2017-02-12 21:12:51 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He might be overly stressed by the personal issues and had difficulty sleeping
[2017-02-12 21:13:22 UTC] aglet57: @fuzzyblumpkinz No, I mean like if he or Leanna were sick, or if there was an emergency, it's Phil. He would be on Twitter talking about it.
[2017-02-12 21:13:30 UTC] aglet57: It's just his nature.
[2017-02-12 21:13:31 UTC] podusmonens: he can't set up an alarm to wake him up when the stream is supposed to start so he can notify the viewers on twitter? are you kidding me?
[2017-02-12 21:13:36 UTC] aglet57: So yeah, hopefully sleep.
[2017-02-12 21:13:45 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: @aglet57 yeah but he is most likely sleeping.
[2017-02-12 21:13:57 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He has notified us before when he was ill, this is strange
[2017-02-12 21:14:20 UTC] theycallmejimbob: last time he missed a stream he didn't post anything about it until a few hours later
[2017-02-12 21:14:30 UTC] ginosaji48: maybe Leanna killed him
[2017-02-12 21:14:37 UTC] marpat1993: Lol
[2017-02-12 21:14:47 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Hopefully its the other way round Kappa
[2017-02-12 21:14:49 UTC] jmon_1985: That's fucked up
[2017-02-12 21:14:51 UTC] leokira997: LUL
[2017-02-12 21:14:54 UTC] kg12228: @ginosaji48 bc he won't get a dog lol
[2017-02-12 21:15:05 UTC] ginosaji48: :D
[2017-02-12 21:15:12 UTC] coldkiller86: he must be pretty comatosed by sickness to not make stream on time or Twitter out he cant stream today
[2017-02-12 21:15:32 UTC] phoenixrising2015: He met the real life Mr. Shakedown
[2017-02-12 21:15:47 UTC] jmon_1985: So how long is everybody staying
[2017-02-12 21:16:04 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He's actually an illegal immigrant and got caught by Trump's Homeland Security Kappa
[2017-02-12 21:16:11 UTC] ginosaji48: wonder how hard it gets for a man to get to computer, turn it on, get on twitter and tweet out whats goin on
[2017-02-12 21:16:14 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: IT just requires him to sleep not to be able to do things
[2017-02-12 21:16:17 UTC] barbaro497: so no stream right?
[2017-02-12 21:16:20 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He has personal issues because he's in jail Kappa
[2017-02-12 21:16:30 UTC] leokira997: until i make a joke people dont like and get banned, which could potentially take a while
[2017-02-12 21:16:39 UTC] aglet57: EvilAJ finally found him. lol
[2017-02-12 21:16:47 UTC] theycallmejimbob: cahman Gino he could reach over to his nightstand pick up his phone and tweet from that :P
[2017-02-12 21:16:59 UTC] marpat1993: SoK invadedhis house
[2017-02-12 21:17:03 UTC] ginosaji48: Next patreon goal - Getting Phil out of jail
[2017-02-12 21:17:09 UTC] leokira997: ^
[2017-02-12 21:17:12 UTC] podusmonens: jimmy too much effort
[2017-02-12 21:17:16 UTC] kg12228: @theycallmejimbob or Leanna could.....takes 5 secs to type a tweet
[2017-02-12 21:17:37 UTC] shotinthedeep: too much work jimbob
[2017-02-12 21:17:47 UTC] shotinthedeep: He's taking the day off so he's not gonna work
[2017-02-12 21:17:50 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Leannas too busy sneaking a dog into the house
[2017-02-12 21:18:10 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Building a hidden dog wonderland is time consuming
[2017-02-12 21:18:15 UTC] ginosaji48: or maybe he was about to tweet he's setting up stream but got Swatted before doing it
[2017-02-12 21:18:21 UTC] ginosaji48: nothing he could do
[2017-02-12 21:18:26 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: That would sure wake him up
[2017-02-12 21:18:29 UTC] aglet57: Hopefully this doesn't become an extra 20 mins on WIP
[2017-02-12 21:18:33 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The Loan Sharks came by and let him off with a warning. Hes sleeping off the broken leg pain.
[2017-02-12 21:18:34 UTC] kg12228: @ginosaji48 that's a lot of gamer shit
[2017-02-12 21:18:36 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I don't think anyone would invade him did you not see the axe he keeps in the living room
[2017-02-12 21:18:45 UTC] leokira997: AGLET57, you already know
[2017-02-12 21:18:48 UTC] aglet57: Or another serious business update

[2017-02-12 21:20:28 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Theres no dedicated servers for full release of for honor. Its peer to peer and a lot of peoplr are mad about that apparently

[2017-02-12 21:20:47 UTC] blue_blur64: Well that can be a problem fuzzy

[2017-02-12 21:34:13 UTC] aglet57: they went to California and they're never coming back
[2017-02-12 21:34:13 UTC] shotinthedeep: Nah the police called them first and leanna said they're fine so the police never arrested leanna

[2017-02-12 21:36:57 UTC] marpat1993: Je has to smack him witj the spoon

[2017-02-12 21:37:58 UTC] shotinthedeep: You're that desperate bethe?

[2017-02-12 21:39:48 UTC] jmon_1985: Lol
[2017-02-12 21:39:55 UTC] wolfofchaos666: No stream today ?
[2017-02-12 21:39:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: 0762ehteb
[2017-02-12 21:40:06 UTC] theycallmejimbob: !schedule
[2017-02-12 21:40:07 UTC] nightbot: No stream today unless Phil appears unexpectedly. Nioh may resume on stream tomorrow. Prepare for For Honor on Tuesday! Yakuza 0 will be played offline when time allows.
[2017-02-12 21:40:13 UTC] podusmonens: no, only jokes with Bee-duh
[2017-02-12 21:40:21 UTC] ginosaji48: !brazzers
[2017-02-12 21:40:21 UTC] nightbot: Do you really need my help to find porn? How sad ;)
[2017-02-12 21:40:56 UTC] bethe2670: DONT JOKE ABOUT ME
[2017-02-12 21:41:06 UTC] bethe2670: it hurts my feelings :(
[2017-02-12 21:41:32 UTC] shotinthedeep: You do realize that this is why people joke about you
[2017-02-12 21:41:47 UTC] shotinthedeep: because of how you react to it
[2017-02-12 21:41:47 UTC] bethe2670: hmm
[2017-02-12 21:41:56 UTC] marpat1993: Well i cant decide hentai or actual porn
[2017-02-12 21:41:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: shame you don't care about others feelings when you tell your jokes bethe
[2017-02-12 21:42:09 UTC] jmon_1985: Shots fired
[2017-02-12 21:42:49 UTC] podusmonens: :D
[2017-02-12 21:42:55 UTC] bethe2670: I SAID I WAS SORRY TO GINO
[2017-02-12 21:42:58 UTC] bethe2670: :(
[2017-02-12 21:43:41 UTC] shotinthedeep: Guess it was one too many times that you hurt gino
[2017-02-12 21:44:46 UTC] leokira997: he has tweeted, he is awake
[2017-02-12 21:44:52 UTC] coldkiller86: has he Come on yet or still Dead air
[2017-02-12 21:44:54 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: well phil is awake
[2017-02-12 21:45:07 UTC] shotinthedeep: Feeling a bit better after forcing myself to actually get some sleep. Behind-the-scenes stress (unrelated to work) can be very debilitating
[2017-02-12 21:45:18 UTC] shotinthedeep: Still didn't say if he was gonna stream or not
[2017-02-12 21:45:19 UTC] podusmonens: they live
[2017-02-12 21:45:32 UTC] jmon_1985: The king lives
[2017-02-12 21:45:48 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Is he coming on then?
[2017-02-12 21:45:59 UTC] bethe2670: THE KING IS ALIVE
[2017-02-12 21:46:10 UTC] ginosaji48: i dont think he will stream
[2017-02-12 21:46:22 UTC] bethe2670: he could
[2017-02-12 21:46:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: well that puts to bed the homicide theory someone had
[2017-02-12 21:46:27 UTC] bethe2670: and go a hour later
[2017-02-12 21:46:36 UTC] leokira997: an hour? please
[2017-02-12 21:46:52 UTC] bethe2670: he put out a beta coee
[2017-02-12 21:46:55 UTC] bethe2670: code
[2017-02-12 21:47:04 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I think an update is due soonish
[2017-02-12 21:48:50 UTC] bethe2670: and phil is not ill like people said
[2017-02-12 21:48:52 UTC] bethe2670: :P
[2017-02-12 21:48:57 UTC] aglet57: so Leanna didn't kill him in the conversvatory with the lead pipe?
[2017-02-12 21:49:15 UTC] aglet57: OR Leanna posted that status on his Twitter AFTER killing him!
[2017-02-12 21:49:21 UTC] jmon_1985: Of course Maddie is the first to reply
[2017-02-12 21:49:26 UTC] aglet57: Conspiracy Lives!
[2017-02-12 21:49:35 UTC] marpat1993: What are we playing CLUEDO
[2017-02-12 21:49:47 UTC] jmon_1985: *maddog
[2017-02-12 21:49:54 UTC] aglet57: Maybe Mr. Body killed the cook!
[2017-02-12 21:50:50 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he should change his name to lap dog jmon_1985 :P
[2017-02-12 21:51:53 UTC] bethe2670: shut it
[2017-02-12 21:52:18 UTC] marpat1993: Time to get get going guys mu chickens are hungry

[2017-02-12 21:52:46 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bye Marpat
[2017-02-12 21:53:06 UTC] bethe2670: bye marpat
[2017-02-12 21:53:11 UTC] royal_phalanx91: bye
[2017-02-12 21:58:49 UTC] podusmonens: ladpog2670
[2017-02-12 21:58:57 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :D
[2017-02-12 21:59:47 UTC] bethe2670: SHHHHHHH
[2017-02-12 22:00:10 UTC] podusmonens: you got it wrong
[2017-02-12 22:00:15 UTC] podusmonens: it's hisssss
[2017-02-12 22:00:25 UTC] podusmonens: because you're a snake too
[2017-02-12 22:00:36 UTC] bethe2670: im not a snake
[2017-02-12 22:00:38 UTC] ginosaji48: omfg is it so hard for him to tweet if he's going to stream or not ?
[2017-02-12 22:00:46 UTC] bethe2670: i know
[2017-02-12 22:01:26 UTC] vypek: its like 2 hours into stream time. probably not happening. no significant progress will be made
[2017-02-12 22:01:27 UTC] podusmonens: hen gave away a code for injustice
[2017-02-12 22:01:36 UTC] podusmonens: he*
[2017-02-12 22:02:15 UTC] bethe2670: its only 1 hour into gameplay time
[2017-02-12 22:02:26 UTC] bethe2670: he could extend the stream a hour
[2017-02-12 22:02:29 UTC] aglet57: He wasn't doing a late stream, so since he's late at this rate, he won't stream. Still has to record WIP too.
[2017-02-12 22:02:30 UTC] bethe2670: and it would be normal
[2017-02-12 22:03:10 UTC] vypek: doubtful he'll move the stream back an hour when there is other stuff to record like WIP, other videos to work on like kocc, and patron stuff to do.
[2017-02-12 22:03:28 UTC] yacherdy: lol hes not streaming today
[2017-02-12 22:03:42 UTC] bethe2670: he could extend stream then eat dinner and like he does anyway do the other things after
[2017-02-12 22:04:11 UTC] shotinthedeep: or maybe just come here and stream the wip
[2017-02-12 22:04:24 UTC] yacherdy: Anyways...his condo has been pending sale for awhile now...I wonder if it didnt go through...or maybe it did and his credit is fucked now
[2017-02-12 22:04:35 UTC] shotinthedeep: well its a short sale
[2017-02-12 22:04:43 UTC] shotinthedeep: it says so on the page
[2017-02-12 22:04:45 UTC] yacherdy: still...
[2017-02-12 22:04:59 UTC] shotinthedeep: those sorts of things can take half a year
[2017-02-12 22:05:43 UTC] yacherdy: Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ, Hang the DJ
[2017-02-12 22:05:51 UTC] aglet57: His credit is screwed. Really should have gotten the new car before the short sale.
[2017-02-12 22:06:15 UTC] yacherdy: most of us live beyond our means....do we really need a expensive car?
[2017-02-12 22:06:17 UTC] shotinthedeep: well his credit should be fine until the short sale goes through
[2017-02-12 22:06:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: (stupid question) why would his credit be screwed if he managed to sell it?
[2017-02-12 22:06:23 UTC] bethe2670: its officially cancelled
[2017-02-12 22:06:23 UTC] aglet57: not a sale
[2017-02-12 22:06:27 UTC] bethe2670: :(
[2017-02-12 22:06:32 UTC] bethe2670: he just tweeted
[2017-02-12 22:06:38 UTC] bethe2670: so im out fuck this shit
[2017-02-12 22:06:43 UTC] yacherdy: bethe no
[2017-02-12 22:06:47 UTC] yacherdy: don't leave me bb
[2017-02-12 22:06:47 UTC] aglet57: Short sale surrenders the property to the bank, @theycallmejimbob
[2017-02-12 22:06:52 UTC] vypek: lol it was pretty obvious there would be no stream though
[2017-02-12 22:06:59 UTC] shotinthedeep: jimbob its sort of like a bankruptcy of sorts
[2017-02-12 22:07:13 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah ty AGLET57 shotinthedeep that would indeed screw your credit
[2017-02-12 22:07:24 UTC] yacherdy: I'm guessing his monthly payments were around 850...doesnt have to pay those anymore but his credit will be fucked
[2017-02-12 22:07:39 UTC] royal_phalanx91: i'm out then , bye everyone
[2017-02-12 22:07:45 UTC] yacherdy: wow everyone leaving
[2017-02-12 22:07:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bye Royal
[2017-02-12 22:07:53 UTC] aglet57: He'll save money not having to make the condo payments which is great short term, but long term you're screwed
[2017-02-12 22:07:54 UTC] yacherdy: bye bye
[2017-02-12 22:08:03 UTC] yacherdy: @AGLET57 exactly
[2017-02-12 22:08:13 UTC] shotinthedeep: well hes not streaming so guess ill be leaving then
[2017-02-12 22:08:22 UTC] yacherdy: bye bye
[2017-02-12 22:08:22 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bye deep
[2017-02-12 22:08:23 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yep bye
[2017-02-12 22:08:28 UTC] shotinthedeep: bye all
[2017-02-12 22:08:43 UTC] yacherdy: everyone leaving me...this is my life
[2017-02-12 22:09:04 UTC] yacherdy: *ties noose...hang self*
[2017-02-12 22:09:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: *cuts rope*
[2017-02-12 22:10:28 UTC] aglet57: lol
[2017-02-12 22:10:32 UTC] yacherdy: well that got morbid for a bit
[2017-02-12 22:10:35 UTC] yacherdy: my bad
[2017-02-12 22:10:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: there will be more Nioh tomorrow YaCherdy don't worry
[2017-02-12 22:11:16 UTC] thekingofshamelessfatfuks: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwRr81hXYAUgj4w.jpg:large
[2017-02-12 22:11:16 UTC] nightbot: thekingofshamelessfatfuks -> There's more where that came from. [stop posting links] [warning]
[2017-02-12 22:12:04 UTC] yacherdy: That's good...I mean I don't care about the game, only the chat tbh
[2017-02-12 22:12:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the chat is a great distraction during lull times in games
[2017-02-12 22:13:11 UTC] aglet57: yeah, I'm here for prestream and talking to people. If it's a game I like, I'll watch live. If not, Youtube.
[2017-02-12 22:13:16 UTC] yacherdy: Yes....If it was a game I liked I would shut up more in the chat
[2017-02-12 22:13:26 UTC] yacherdy: but alas
[2017-02-12 22:13:43 UTC] yacherdy: Nioh is not the game for me
[2017-02-12 22:14:08 UTC] aglet57: yeah, they can't all be winners
[2017-02-12 22:14:28 UTC] aglet57: I loved seeing RE7, especially cause I wasn't going to play it
[2017-02-12 22:14:57 UTC] yacherdy: Well, I'm sure Nioh is loved by a lot of people. Just not me in particular...all opinion of course. Not saying its a bad game.
[2017-02-12 22:15:29 UTC] aglet57: I'm not into it. Nor was I into Dark Souls.
[2017-02-12 22:15:31 UTC] yacherdy: but Phil lately has done a lot of Dark Souls/Japanese style games that don't appeal to me often
[2017-02-12 22:15:34 UTC] yacherdy: yeah
[2017-02-12 22:15:59 UTC] aglet57: He had fun, but I didn't watch the Dark Souls run at all.
[2017-02-12 22:16:29 UTC] yacherdy: I was kind of into it until he started to get over leveled/OP weapons.
[2017-02-12 22:16:39 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I didn't really like Yakuza 0 and FF15 myself
[2017-02-12 22:17:18 UTC] yacherdy: Yakuza 0 is not a game I can watch nor really play. FF15 was decent and that's a surprise coming from me because I don't like FF games. But Phil hated on a lot of that game.
[2017-02-12 22:17:38 UTC] aglet57: The "no handholding" handholding bothered me, but no one had a gun to my head to watch it either. So I passed.
[2017-02-12 22:18:03 UTC] aglet57: I don't know how I feel about Yakuza. Sometimes it looks fun, but I think I'd have an issue with the language barrier.
[2017-02-12 22:18:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I think it's one of those games that are better to play for yourself rather than watching it
[2017-02-12 22:18:44 UTC] aglet57: Definitely
[2017-02-12 22:18:53 UTC] yacherdy: The gameplay turns me off...the story looks okay but nothing blow away. I guess the one thing I seem to like about it is the whacky side missions like Saints Row but Japanese style.
[2017-02-12 22:19:46 UTC] aglet57: What's coming soon? Any new releases?
[2017-02-12 22:20:58 UTC] jmon_1985: for honor
[2017-02-12 22:21:20 UTC] leokira997: ff15 isnt a ff game though
[2017-02-12 22:21:22 UTC] yacherdy: TWD episode in March. Andromeda
[2017-02-12 22:21:37 UTC] yacherdy: @LeoKira997 Well I'm not a big fan so I don't care either way
[2017-02-12 22:21:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: sniper elite 4 but Phil isn't gonna play it
[2017-02-12 22:21:43 UTC] aglet57: I need something new to play. I got a PS4 just sitting there.
[2017-02-12 22:21:46 UTC] yacherdy: to hardcore fans I'm sure it bothered people
[2017-02-12 22:21:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: South Park got delayed again :(
[2017-02-12 22:22:22 UTC] yacherdy: I bought Stick of Truth on Christmas..got a couple hours into it..need to finish it
[2017-02-12 22:23:45 UTC] jmon_1985: wish they would put some decent games on ps plus
[2017-02-12 22:24:25 UTC] yacherdy: I'm sure there are some hidden gems on there.
[2017-02-12 22:25:52 UTC] theycallmejimbob: not a hero is a good game if you haven't played it already
[2017-02-12 22:26:29 UTC] yacherdy: There goes my hero...
[2017-02-12 22:26:32 UTC] yacherdy: watch him as he comes
[2017-02-12 22:26:51 UTC] yacherdy: or goes
[2017-02-12 22:26:52 UTC] yacherdy: whatevb
[2017-02-12 22:27:17 UTC] aglet57: lol
[2017-02-12 22:27:26 UTC] aglet57: I was just listening to them
[2017-02-12 22:27:53 UTC] aglet57: Best of You, specifically
[2017-02-12 22:28:00 UTC] yacherdy: I've seen them live a few times...2003 in Oregon, 2005 in California, 2006 in Washington
[2017-02-12 22:28:28 UTC] yacherdy: state*
[2017-02-12 22:28:35 UTC] aglet57: I don't see many shows of anyone these days.
[2017-02-12 22:28:43 UTC] aglet57: Might see Tom Petty this year
[2017-02-12 22:29:23 UTC] yacherdy: Dave Grohl was supposed to become Tom Petty's drummer after Kurt Cobain had died and Nirvana ended..but he declined because he wanted to start Foo Fighters
[2017-02-12 22:29:31 UTC] yacherdy: true story
[2017-02-12 22:29:44 UTC] aglet57: Yeah, it was during Wildflowers. He played with Tom on SNL
[2017-02-12 22:29:51 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah I remember that
[2017-02-12 22:29:54 UTC] theycallmejimbob: didn't they record their debut album in a week or something?
[2017-02-12 22:30:02 UTC] yacherdy: Foo Fighters?
[2017-02-12 22:30:06 UTC] aglet57: Dave's good people.
[2017-02-12 22:30:11 UTC] aglet57: Quality musician
[2017-02-12 22:30:27 UTC] yacherdy: Yes...Dave recorded all the instruments himself in a week for Foo's debut
[2017-02-12 22:31:06 UTC] yacherdy: some of those songs were when Nirvana were around...Kurt really liked them and asked Dave if he could put lyrics to them
[2017-02-12 22:31:34 UTC] aglet57: well I've got to go. see you guys tomorrow
[2017-02-12 22:31:43 UTC] yacherdy: later...good talking
