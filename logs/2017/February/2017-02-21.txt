[2017-02-21 20:12:58 UTC] yacherdy: Package deal.
[2017-02-21 20:13:00 UTC] ginosaji48: punk should come back to wwe
[2017-02-21 20:13:12 UTC] capstonegaming: cm punk, seth rollins, and chris jericho vs hhh, samoa joe, and kevin owens with interference by mick foley quitting his job
[2017-02-21 20:13:13 UTC] yacherdy: Punk is my second favorite of all time.
[2017-02-21 20:13:18 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But yeah, the State of the WWE address was "Daniel and Foley arguing about the show's quality, Steph trying to keep things on subject and failing, and Shane laughing at the insanity of it all and not caring"
[2017-02-21 20:13:18 UTC] ginosaji48: i doubt aj lee would ever got back to wwe
[2017-02-21 20:13:25 UTC] podusmonens: cm punk got destroyed in real life by an amateur fighter, why would he show his face every again even in pretend fighting?

[2017-02-21 20:18:05 UTC] capstonegaming: "How could college state champ wrestler/ ufc champion with 3 defences lose to a 60 year old linebacker with 2 moves? Exposing the business like never before"
[2017-02-21 20:18:10 UTC] phoenixrising2015: One of the cool interviews was on WWE's youtube

[2017-02-21 20:19:18 UTC] aglet57: Goldberg should have never been booked to face Owens. That's the mistake.
[2017-02-21 20:19:19 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The idea was at Survivors Series Goldberg broke his ribs with the first spear
[2017-02-21 20:19:22 UTC] bethe2670: deep is on my side jimbob
[2017-02-21 20:19:22 UTC] ginosaji48: i didnt say GB for champ

[2017-02-21 20:20:17 UTC] capstonegaming: spear me out the ring out the arena
[2017-02-21 20:20:18 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Dude if they did that to Goldberg or Brock, that would not be a fun time for that person
[2017-02-21 20:20:19 UTC] aglet57: @CapstoneGaming That's going to cost someone their job, dude
[2017-02-21 20:20:28 UTC] iconicmaster1: Kurt angle going to fight Brock
[2017-02-21 20:20:29 UTC] bethe2670: what has YaCherdy done to deserve mod?
[2017-02-21 20:20:31 UTC] bethe2670: lol
[2017-02-21 20:20:35 UTC] capstonegaming: yeah
[2017-02-21 20:20:50 UTC] phoenixrising2015: If someone oversold to Brock like that to make a mockery, Brock would ensure you actually stay down
[2017-02-21 20:20:50 UTC] capstonegaming: goldberg hits 2 moves practice drop toe holds
[2017-02-21 20:21:00 UTC] capstonegaming: oh another thing
[2017-02-21 20:21:08 UTC] yacherdy: My presence alone @bethe2670
[2017-02-21 20:21:09 UTC] aglet57: Goldberg v Lesnar doesn't need a title. But if it is, that title will be on someone by the first RAW after Mania. Definitely.
[2017-02-21 20:21:09 UTC] capstonegaming: brock has to help goldberg lift him for the jackhammer
[2017-02-21 20:21:09 UTC] ashfordian2015: hi
