[2017-02-07 00:01:27 UTC] manyperegrine81: I would never go Full Time YouTube like this man.

[2017-02-07 00:03:50 UTC] logiawolf: THIS IS HOW YOU DONT PLAY

[2017-02-07 19:11:29 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: anyone here?
[2017-02-07 19:12:01 UTC] akioartorius: why you ask?
[2017-02-07 19:12:09 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: just wondering
[2017-02-07 19:13:12 UTC] akioartorius: well technically I am exiting now, I will be back later.
[2017-02-07 19:13:18 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: ok
[2017-02-07 19:13:24 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: see ya then
[2017-02-07 19:18:22 UTC] eternia_forever: ...........................................
[2017-02-07 19:18:23 UTC] nightbot: eternia_forever -> Please do not spam symbols, thanks. [warning]
[2017-02-07 19:18:47 UTC] barbaro497: when does nioh start?
[2017-02-07 19:19:08 UTC] lich109: I'm usually not here, when does the stream start?
[2017-02-07 19:19:10 UTC] eternia_forever: test
[2017-02-07 19:19:43 UTC] eternia_forever: roughly 330
[2017-02-07 19:19:49 UTC] lich109: Gotcha.
[2017-02-07 19:20:08 UTC] eternia_forever: till pre stream is done and such
[2017-02-07 19:20:28 UTC] barbaro497: thanks eternia
[2017-02-07 19:20:35 UTC] eternia_forever: welcome
[2017-02-07 19:20:51 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: this game is like ninja gaiden meets dark souls
[2017-02-07 19:21:20 UTC] barbaro497: yeah and knowing phil the rage is bound to happen
[2017-02-07 19:21:24 UTC] barbaro497: lol
[2017-02-07 19:21:32 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: yep
[2017-02-07 19:22:58 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: this is also one of those development hell games it was announced back in 2004.
[2017-02-07 19:23:17 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: but it looks like this one actually turned out good.
[2017-02-07 19:23:27 UTC] quakeman17: yay
[2017-02-07 19:23:57 UTC] bethe2670: rick good?
[2017-02-07 19:23:59 UTC] bethe2670: AHAHAHAHHA
[2017-02-07 19:24:05 UTC] bethe2670: that is funny
[2017-02-07 19:26:01 UTC] shotinthedeep: Hahaha. Gameplay will probably start 12:45-1:00 like usual
[2017-02-07 19:27:30 UTC] bethe2670: what you guys on about gameplay will start at like 8:45pm-9pm lol
[2017-02-07 19:27:34 UTC] bethe2670: Kappa
[2017-02-07 19:27:40 UTC] bethe2670: that is only my time
[2017-02-07 19:28:04 UTC] bethe2670: hello deep btw
[2017-02-07 19:28:15 UTC] bethe2670: phil will be raging today
[2017-02-07 19:28:34 UTC] bethe2670: and i'll be raging because he is playing nioh
[2017-02-07 19:29:57 UTC] shotinthedeep: hi bethe
[2017-02-07 19:30:07 UTC] shotinthedeep: i heard the first part is pretty easy
[2017-02-07 19:31:03 UTC] shotinthedeep: I take it you didn't get nioh
[2017-02-07 19:31:43 UTC] shotinthedeep: This can turn out to be a difficult game
[2017-02-07 19:33:03 UTC] kingjhags023: im really excited for this playthrough
[2017-02-07 19:33:17 UTC] bethe2670: hard games usually start you off easy then up the difficulty later
[2017-02-07 19:33:39 UTC] bethe2670: this game will prob be easy for the tutorial then hard the rest of it
[2017-02-07 19:33:41 UTC] bethe2670: lol
[2017-02-07 19:33:52 UTC] bethe2670: im really not excited
[2017-02-07 19:34:03 UTC] kingjadvcmp: what was the last game he played which (I think) is similar to this, it was just nothing but different sorts of boss battles - was quite colourful
[2017-02-07 19:34:11 UTC] dxfreedom: You just dont like it when daddy gets angry Bethe
[2017-02-07 19:34:29 UTC] dxfreedom: I am very ready for some Glamurai Souls!
[2017-02-07 19:34:30 UTC] shotinthedeep: This will still be better than yakuza
[2017-02-07 19:34:33 UTC] bethe2670: i love it when he rages that is the most funniest thing
[2017-02-07 19:34:42 UTC] bethe2670: i just dont like the games
[2017-02-07 19:34:51 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: yakuza is very boring to watch
[2017-02-07 19:34:53 UTC] shotinthedeep: Yep rage is the best
[2017-02-07 19:34:56 UTC] bethe2670: no mans sky is better than yakuza
[2017-02-07 19:35:18 UTC] dxfreedom: Yakuza is gift from the god idk what you guys are talking about
[2017-02-07 19:35:24 UTC] bethe2670: i take that back....that was too harsh
[2017-02-07 19:35:35 UTC] bethe2670: but you get the point
[2017-02-07 19:35:56 UTC] dxfreedom: I kinda liked No Man's Sky for what it was.....*runs*
[2017-02-07 19:35:56 UTC] shotinthedeep: maybe a gift from the god of hell
[2017-02-07 19:36:00 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I was surprised at the lack of rage in the montage that was made for KOGaming. I don't think that guy's ever made a *** vid that had over 100k views. Not saying he's not capable of making vids that can get that, but I don't believe that particular line he fed folk on TKOH
[2017-02-07 19:37:18 UTC] shotinthedeep: It was a best moments montage not a rage montage
[2017-02-07 19:37:21 UTC] bethe2670: you dont really need rage in a montage though
[2017-02-07 19:37:28 UTC] kingjadvcmp: but the best moments are often the rage
[2017-02-07 19:37:42 UTC] bethe2670: agreed
[2017-02-07 19:37:57 UTC] kingjadvcmp: plus in general, I felt it was poorly put together. Music seemed random, and Phil's actual triumphs were kinda sped up at times lol
[2017-02-07 19:38:55 UTC] kingjadvcmp: that's just my take on it anyways, what do others think?
[2017-02-07 19:39:04 UTC] bethe2670: it was probably some random person trying to be creative, probably first time making a montage or editing
[2017-02-07 19:39:27 UTC] rembrandth: I liked that montage :)
[2017-02-07 19:39:29 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well no, that person claimed on TKOH he used to make TIHYDPs, and has videos over 100k on his channel (of stuff not related to Phil)
[2017-02-07 19:39:30 UTC] akioartorius: the kogaming montage of dark souls?
[2017-02-07 19:39:37 UTC] bethe2670: i liked the montage it was good
[2017-02-07 19:39:43 UTC] shotinthedeep: Yeah, I thought the deaths didn't have enought time before Phil died to get the whole picture of the death
[2017-02-07 19:39:43 UTC] bethe2670: yes akio
[2017-02-07 19:40:06 UTC] shotinthedeep: it was just death death death death death, what happened? lol
[2017-02-07 19:40:07 UTC] akioartorius: it was okay but it did skip a few funny moments
[2017-02-07 19:40:12 UTC] kingjhags023: the music was a poor choice and really loud
[2017-02-07 19:40:14 UTC] shotinthedeep: ...but I thought it was pretty good
[2017-02-07 19:40:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh boy oh boy can't wait for this playthrough can't believe it's been nearly 9 months since he played the alpha
[2017-02-07 19:40:22 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I guess from the amount of tooting-their-own-horn, I was expecting more from skysands - I applaud the effort, but the end product seemed kinda rushed
[2017-02-07 19:40:35 UTC] shotinthedeep: Don't worry he'll have facecam on today :P
[2017-02-07 19:40:47 UTC] dxfreedom: The game changed for the better from the Alpha.
[2017-02-07 19:40:50 UTC] shotinthedeep: Maybe not on prestream this time though
[2017-02-07 19:41:03 UTC] dxfreedom: Its great. The combat is so much fun and you can get really creative
[2017-02-07 19:41:05 UTC] bethe2670: well at least he might rage today and he has a facecam
[2017-02-07 19:41:16 UTC] bethe2670: which is always a good thing
[2017-02-07 19:41:22 UTC] bethe2670: shame about the game
[2017-02-07 19:41:29 UTC] bethe2670: NotLikeThis
[2017-02-07 19:41:37 UTC] shotinthedeep: oh hi jimbob :D
[2017-02-07 19:41:42 UTC] kingjhags023: the last chance beta sold me on this game
[2017-02-07 19:41:43 UTC] bethe2670: hello jimbob
[2017-02-07 19:41:49 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey deep I get that reference :P
[2017-02-07 19:41:52 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey bethe
[2017-02-07 19:41:55 UTC] quakeman17: yo jimbob
[2017-02-07 19:42:08 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey quakeman17
[2017-02-07 19:42:16 UTC] shotinthedeep: lol yep straight from the nioh alpha gameplay
[2017-02-07 19:42:41 UTC] akioartorius: nioh alpha is where the incident happened...lets hope phil remembers...
[2017-02-07 19:42:45 UTC] shotinthedeep: We all love the rage
[2017-02-07 19:42:53 UTC] kingjadvcmp: someone may need to refresh Phil's memory
[2017-02-07 19:43:00 UTC] kingjhags023: what incident?
[2017-02-07 19:43:06 UTC] dxfreedom: was that during the nioh alpha? wow
[2017-02-07 19:43:07 UTC] shotinthedeep: "oh the cameras on"
[2017-02-07 19:43:19 UTC] dxfreedom: "ello
[2017-02-07 19:43:34 UTC] kingjhags023: oh lmao i forgot it was during the alpha
[2017-02-07 19:43:36 UTC] shotinthedeep: cameras been on the whole time, huh?
[2017-02-07 19:43:39 UTC] akioartorius: during the second nioh alpha prestream If I remember correctly maybe the third
[2017-02-07 19:43:47 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: i threw up for the first time in years that day
[2017-02-07 19:43:59 UTC] rembrandth: Let's hope for another leg-scratching incident today
[2017-02-07 19:44:00 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: ate my spaghetti to fast
[2017-02-07 19:44:05 UTC] bammbino: did you all see that nioh is 100% sold out on amazon?
[2017-02-07 19:44:20 UTC] rembrandth: Glad to see it's that popular
[2017-02-07 19:44:21 UTC] dxfreedom: Lets just hope he only beats the game this time
[2017-02-07 19:44:25 UTC] bethe2670: screw nioh
[2017-02-07 19:44:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: his camera was on without him knowing while he was scratching his leg kingjhags023 by his facial expressions people wrongly assumed he was doing something else
[2017-02-07 19:44:50 UTC] akioartorius: it made it to the top 5 shocking moments during a stream or whatever that video was called
[2017-02-07 19:44:50 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob he was jacking off
[2017-02-07 19:44:52 UTC] bammbino: its got 9s for scores, its safe to say we deserve a game w/ a 9 aftter all the shitters
[2017-02-07 19:44:54 UTC] bethe2670: geez
[2017-02-07 19:45:12 UTC] akioartorius: Nioh is going to be interesting to say the least
[2017-02-07 19:45:15 UTC] bethe2670: this game is a shitter
[2017-02-07 19:45:16 UTC] shotinthedeep: You still believe that jimbob?
[2017-02-07 19:45:20 UTC] kingjhags023: ? i thought dsp said himself he was jacking off
[2017-02-07 19:45:22 UTC] kingjadvcmp: can't trust game reviewers though. None of them. Only one source you can trust for game reviews, ain't that right folks?
[2017-02-07 19:45:33 UTC] absol_zero: he was scratching his leg Kappa
[2017-02-07 19:45:48 UTC] rembrandth: Kappa
[2017-02-07 19:45:57 UTC] bethe2670: only one source is too actually play the game your frekin self
[2017-02-07 19:46:18 UTC] shotinthedeep: He first said he was straching his leg, then he hasn't commented on it since directly
[2017-02-07 19:46:23 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil only kinda admitted it when keemstar found out, I think
[2017-02-07 19:46:27 UTC] bethe2670: poor Seth FREAKIN Rollins :(
[2017-02-07 19:46:31 UTC] theycallmejimbob: shotinthedeep, what I said may be classed as alternative facts
[2017-02-07 19:46:43 UTC] xkenwallx: When is the stream starting
[2017-02-07 19:46:51 UTC] akioartorius: in 20 mins
[2017-02-07 19:46:54 UTC] rembrandth: Never seen someone enjoy scratching their leg as much as he did xD
[2017-02-07 19:46:54 UTC] shotinthedeep: Alternative facts are still facts dood
[2017-02-07 19:46:56 UTC] xkenwallx: Thanks
[2017-02-07 19:47:20 UTC] shotinthedeep: Gameplay will prob start in an hour
[2017-02-07 19:47:26 UTC] akioartorius: xKenwallx, probably depends on if Phil is late
[2017-02-07 19:48:06 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil is never late, it's just everyone is always early
[2017-02-07 19:48:10 UTC] dxfreedom: Yea phil admitted it when Keemstar found out and made a video talking or actually laughing about it.
[2017-02-07 19:48:16 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: what happend to seth.
[2017-02-07 19:48:32 UTC] absol_zero: lol
[2017-02-07 19:48:44 UTC] dxfreedom: I think he is going to make sure he isnt going to get in a sticky situation this time.
[2017-02-07 19:48:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :( I was waiting for Phil to appear on drama alert to explain what occurred and it never happened
[2017-02-07 19:49:19 UTC] bammbino: i dont get it.. i always see chat talk about phil jacking off.. but did you guys even bother asking him what he jacked off to??
[2017-02-07 19:49:22 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I don't like keemstar much. bit of a horrible person, IMO
[2017-02-07 19:49:31 UTC] akioartorius: porn duh
[2017-02-07 19:49:40 UTC] dxfreedom: His nickname Dick Lightning was brought up a lot
[2017-02-07 19:49:41 UTC] bammbino: @akioartorius, specifics!
[2017-02-07 19:49:42 UTC] kingjadvcmp: you're not allowed to ask about the jerking-off incident btw
[2017-02-07 19:49:43 UTC] bammbino: links!
[2017-02-07 19:49:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I don't think many people would disagree with you KingjadVCMP
[2017-02-07 19:50:05 UTC] akioartorius: Bammbino, only mods can put up links i think
[2017-02-07 19:50:28 UTC] shotinthedeep: you can put up links
[2017-02-07 19:50:47 UTC] akioartorius: last time I tried nightbot sent a warning
[2017-02-07 19:50:53 UTC] shotinthedeep: just leave a space after the period
[2017-02-07 19:50:59 UTC] shotinthedeep: google. com
[2017-02-07 19:51:06 UTC] bammbino: nono, you said porn but i was replying to you that people need specifics and/or links lol
[2017-02-07 19:51:19 UTC] bammbino: of course he was watching porn, just dont know what type
[2017-02-07 19:51:27 UTC] bethe2670: !brazzers
[2017-02-07 19:51:27 UTC] nightbot: Do you really need my help to find porn? How sad ;)
[2017-02-07 19:51:29 UTC] bethe2670: :D
[2017-02-07 19:51:44 UTC] bammbino: wtf they actually have a command for that
[2017-02-07 19:51:52 UTC] bethe2670: yep
[2017-02-07 19:51:53 UTC] kingjadvcmp: there's a bit of a gruesome question, what do you think is Phil's preferred porn choice? Can only remember him scrolling through porn titles with Leanna once, was a bit of an awkward video to view
[2017-02-07 19:52:11 UTC] akioartorius: once? it was twice
[2017-02-07 19:52:12 UTC] bammbino: can i be honest king?
[2017-02-07 19:52:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it's not something I have given much thought to King :P
[2017-02-07 19:52:23 UTC] shotinthedeep: I thought he did that twice KingjadVCMP
[2017-02-07 19:52:29 UTC] rembrandth: @KingjadVCMP lol what? When was that?
[2017-02-07 19:52:36 UTC] bammbino: i think phil jacks off over bad game cameras
[2017-02-07 19:52:41 UTC] bammbino: like bloodborne
[2017-02-07 19:52:48 UTC] dxfreedom: It was obviously over Kojima
[2017-02-07 19:52:57 UTC] bammbino: that too
[2017-02-07 19:53:04 UTC] akioartorius: search panda lee on Phil's dspgaming channel you will see the video
[2017-02-07 19:53:05 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I honestly cannot remember when, I just remember seeing it once, they were at a hotel I believe and just were scrolling through the videos
[2017-02-07 19:53:17 UTC] akioartorius: It was twice actually
[2017-02-07 19:53:28 UTC] kingjadvcmp: two seperate times? lol
[2017-02-07 19:53:38 UTC] bammbino: didnt one of them get flagged by youtube over the title?
[2017-02-07 19:53:41 UTC] akioartorius: at least only two videos
[2017-02-07 19:53:54 UTC] akioartorius: yes it did or they both did
[2017-02-07 19:54:06 UTC] kingjadvcmp: what was the title?
[2017-02-07 19:54:23 UTC] bammbino: something on the verge of being xrated
[2017-02-07 19:54:31 UTC] akioartorius: just type pandalee on the dspgaming channel you will see it
[2017-02-07 19:55:14 UTC] bammbino: "more hardcore sex w/ pandalee" lol

[2017-02-07 19:55:42 UTC] bammbino: it was him trying to be funny since other YTbers do stupid titles like that
[2017-02-07 19:56:06 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil use clickbait? outrageous accusation
[2017-02-07 19:56:06 UTC] theycallmejimbob: thanks for posting it deep
[2017-02-07 19:56:12 UTC] akioartorius: there was no actually porn just them scrolling the porn titles
[2017-02-07 19:56:28 UTC] dxfreedom: Lets just hope he only plays with Nioh's Spears this time
[2017-02-07 19:57:03 UTC] akioartorius: he should use the spirits more
[2017-02-07 19:57:51 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i honestly don't expect much from this
[2017-02-07 19:57:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: can you get a Black Knight Halberd in Nioh
[2017-02-07 19:58:25 UTC] akioartorius: Death counter is needed
[2017-02-07 19:58:28 UTC] taurusoxford: no
[2017-02-07 19:58:37 UTC] akioartorius: Fail counter also
[2017-02-07 19:58:38 UTC] rembrandth: Is he doing a death counter for this?
[2017-02-07 19:58:43 UTC] bethe2670: lol jimbob
[2017-02-07 19:58:45 UTC] taurusoxford: I think so?
[2017-02-07 19:58:45 UTC] bammbino: deadth counter is NOT needed
[2017-02-07 19:58:47 UTC] bethe2670: yes
[2017-02-07 19:58:47 UTC] dzengo90: hdllo
[2017-02-07 19:58:49 UTC] bammbino: the game is peaky
[2017-02-07 19:58:53 UTC] dzengo90: Can anyone see what i type
[2017-02-07 19:58:57 UTC] dzengo90: am i verified?
[2017-02-07 19:58:57 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey dzengo90
[2017-02-07 19:58:57 UTC] bethe2670: death counter IS NEEDED

[2017-02-07 19:59:19 UTC] dzengo90: excited for some rage haha
[2017-02-07 19:59:21 UTC] bammbino: bethe2670, you're clueless in this genre
[2017-02-07 19:59:26 UTC] dzengo90: All love tho
[2017-02-07 19:59:27 UTC] bammbino: nioh has balancing issues
[2017-02-07 19:59:28 UTC] akioartorius: Bammbino, after what happened in the alpha, I disagree
[2017-02-07 19:59:33 UTC] bethe2670: ResidentSleeper
[2017-02-07 19:59:36 UTC] dzengo90: Is nioh harder than souls games?
[2017-02-07 19:59:45 UTC] bethe2670: of course
[2017-02-07 19:59:48 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: dspAngrydsp
[2017-02-07 19:59:57 UTC] taurusoxford: not really, it just requires a different play style
[2017-02-07 19:59:59 UTC] bethe2670: already but phil isnt here yet
[2017-02-07 20:00:05 UTC] akioartorius: I wonder if phil is reading these comments
[2017-02-07 20:00:11 UTC] taurusoxford: if you try to play Nioh like Dark Souls you'll get obliterated
[2017-02-07 20:00:11 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: this is from the team that made the ninja gaiden games in the early 200s
[2017-02-07 20:00:14 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: 200s
[2017-02-07 20:00:14 UTC] dzengo90: Big souls fan but Nioh not my thing
[2017-02-07 20:00:18 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: 2000s
[2017-02-07 20:00:21 UTC] akioartorius: 200s ha
[2017-02-07 20:00:22 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil does not have time to read comments, he is far too busy
[2017-02-07 20:00:36 UTC] bammbino: i know the alpha was rough and the beta's warrior of the east was CANCER!!! but the game has balancing issues
[2017-02-07 20:00:42 UTC] bammbino: majority of the game is a cake
[2017-02-07 20:00:45 UTC] dzengo90: Random question
[2017-02-07 20:00:49 UTC] kingjadvcmp: the cake is a lie
[2017-02-07 20:00:50 UTC] bammbino: only a few bosses are op
[2017-02-07 20:01:02 UTC] akioartorius: no spoilers though
[2017-02-07 20:01:03 UTC] dxfreedom: Warrior of the east wasnt bad at all. you just need to git gud
[2017-02-07 20:01:04 UTC] rembrandth: That 1v1 boss from the beta was pretty rough
[2017-02-07 20:01:13 UTC] bammbino: @RembrandtH, YEP!!!
[2017-02-07 20:01:17 UTC] bammbino: took me 12 hours
[2017-02-07 20:01:18 UTC] taurusoxford: was watching Maximilian stream Nioh last night - his donations were off the fucking charts
[2017-02-07 20:01:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: what is it dzengo90
[2017-02-07 20:01:20 UTC] dxfreedom: There are also like 5 cheese strats for him
[2017-02-07 20:01:26 UTC] bethe2670: bammbino you forget this is phil who will be playing
[2017-02-07 20:01:29 UTC] kingjadvcmp: shout-out to cheddar
[2017-02-07 20:01:31 UTC] rembrandth: Took me 30 mins, but it was still a hard fight
[2017-02-07 20:02:01 UTC] dzengo90: I got gtx 1070 laptop and im getting decent frame rates in many games however others that have the same laptop get better fps. i dont get it.
[2017-02-07 20:02:08 UTC] bammbino: i know phil is playing but another streamer i follow who is worse than phil at this died 80 times..
[2017-02-07 20:02:18 UTC] dzengo90: all drivers up to date
[2017-02-07 20:02:18 UTC] taurusoxford: who?
[2017-02-07 20:02:24 UTC] bammbino: cohh
[2017-02-07 20:02:30 UTC] bethe2670: you do not know how bad phil will be
[2017-02-07 20:02:41 UTC] bethe2670: he might die 100 times or more
[2017-02-07 20:02:49 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil has played all the dark souls games, this game will be a walk in the park for him.
[2017-02-07 20:02:51 UTC] kingjadvcmp: ah fuck a pc specs question. Better wait for Phil, he used to build computers, he'll know what to do. (I don't know if anyone else in here has good PC knowledge)
[2017-02-07 20:02:52 UTC] dxfreedom: But you never know with phil. Sometimes he is stuck for hours where no one ever gets stuck or has any kind of trouble. And then on the other hand he goes ahead and beat a hard boss first try
[2017-02-07 20:02:55 UTC] soulrider95: Been watchin some other streamers play, looks great
[2017-02-07 20:02:58 UTC] rembrandth: Phil has a knack for finding op gear in these types of games. I don't think he'll be too bad
[2017-02-07 20:03:03 UTC] darksydephil: hello all
[2017-02-07 20:03:04 UTC] dzengo90: il check google i guess

[2017-02-07 20:03:12 UTC] popsicolo: HeyGuys
[2017-02-07 20:03:16 UTC] darksydephil: setting up now
[2017-02-07 20:03:17 UTC] dzengo90: Ready for the rage phil?
[2017-02-07 20:03:21 UTC] taurusoxford: Phil has a weird tendency to one-shot the tough bosses but spend forever fighting what most consider an easy boss
[2017-02-07 20:03:24 UTC] dzengo90: Tough game!
[2017-02-07 20:03:29 UTC] bethe2670: hey phil and pops
[2017-02-07 20:03:38 UTC] bammbino: bethe2670, you're still new to phil and you said so yourself.. i have followed phil since since he started and i think hes better at these games than most streamers/YTbers
[2017-02-07 20:03:38 UTC] darksydephil: ill probably do the game giveaway at the end of this 1st stream session
[2017-02-07 20:03:55 UTC] darksydephil: that way if the giveaway function of nightbot doesn't work we can figure somethign out
[2017-02-07 20:04:00 UTC] popsicolo: THE BOT
[2017-02-07 20:04:14 UTC] kingjadvcmp: have you thought of how you'll give it away Phil? A detractor won a giveaway before remember.
[2017-02-07 20:04:16 UTC] bethe2670: bammbino i have not said im new to phil i known phil since 2010 that is not new
[2017-02-07 20:04:24 UTC] taurusoxford: Knowing nightbot it'll probably ban the winner from chat :P
[2017-02-07 20:04:27 UTC] bethe2670: dont know where you got that from
[2017-02-07 20:04:35 UTC] veronix_x: hi guys.
[2017-02-07 20:04:37 UTC] elipsion: Use the twitch giveaways app
[2017-02-07 20:04:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey Veronix_x
[2017-02-07 20:04:44 UTC] elipsion: It`s probably more reliable
[2017-02-07 20:04:44 UTC] fademadaway: phil please do the give away before the stream!
[2017-02-07 20:04:46 UTC] popsicolo: Nioh-Pets PogChamp
[2017-02-07 20:04:48 UTC] kingjadvcmp: oh will Nightbot pick a winner?
[2017-02-07 20:04:50 UTC] dzengo90: i wish you do at the beginning, since it will be super late for me at the end of your 1st session
[2017-02-07 20:04:56 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: i found a picture of a young phil in a punsiher costume
[2017-02-07 20:05:00 UTC] veronix_x: Cant wait. :D
[2017-02-07 20:05:01 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: punisher
[2017-02-07 20:05:02 UTC] bethe2670: phil is this easy = hard and hard = easy
[2017-02-07 20:05:13 UTC] darksydephil: i see your new fanart pops! adding it now
[2017-02-07 20:05:16 UTC] absol_zero: yeah, you should do the giveaway at the beginning tbh
[2017-02-07 20:05:16 UTC] fademadaway: why does it say phil is offline?
[2017-02-07 20:05:19 UTC] popsicolo: Great, thanks!
[2017-02-07 20:05:21 UTC] veronix_x: for Nioh and Phil's fails. :D
[2017-02-07 20:05:24 UTC] kingjadvcmp: cos he's not online
[2017-02-07 20:05:25 UTC] kingjadvcmp: simple
[2017-02-07 20:05:26 UTC] bethe2670: also he dies a lot on the normal enemies and not really to bosses
[2017-02-07 20:05:32 UTC] akioartorius: death counter Phil?
[2017-02-07 20:05:38 UTC] fademadaway: hes talking chat clearly hes online idiot

[2017-02-07 20:05:50 UTC] kingjadvcmp: bit rude
[2017-02-07 20:05:53 UTC] mc_burnout26: lobosHi
[2017-02-07 20:05:55 UTC] bethe2670: i dont know shit about this game because i dont give 2 fucks about this game
[2017-02-07 20:06:00 UTC] kingjadvcmp: mods gonna let that mean person get away with that? :-(
[2017-02-07 20:06:02 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: make sure to stay in action mode for 60 fps
[2017-02-07 20:06:07 UTC] fademadaway: he insulted me first
[2017-02-07 20:06:11 UTC] bethe2670: if it makes phil rage with facecam and death counter im happy
[2017-02-07 20:06:27 UTC] popsicolo: Here's a hint on what my fanart for this game is like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1wcuoxs4mU
[2017-02-07 20:06:34 UTC] gab00332: for khaz modan! SwiftRage
[2017-02-07 20:06:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: two wrongs don't make a right
[2017-02-07 20:06:48 UTC] mc_burnout26: Finally got my taxes done by myself. Got that out of the way.
[2017-02-07 20:06:58 UTC] shotinthedeep: Surprised it's not a trashman Pops
[2017-02-07 20:07:00 UTC] fademadaway: i asked a simple question and was insulted
[2017-02-07 20:07:02 UTC] bammbino: GAB00332, FOR THE KING!
[2017-02-07 20:07:06 UTC] kingjadvcmp: where was the insult?
[2017-02-07 20:07:10 UTC] popsicolo: YOOOOOOO
[2017-02-07 20:07:10 UTC] dxfreedom: Bethe you had every game. But you are always here
[2017-02-07 20:07:21 UTC] takisq: Yo
[2017-02-07 20:07:25 UTC] popsicolo: There's always time for that later, Deep.
[2017-02-07 20:07:27 UTC] takisq: is there gonna be a camera and death count/
[2017-02-07 20:07:30 UTC] takisq: ?*
[2017-02-07 20:07:34 UTC] veronix_x: I assume the code will work oly for US territory. :)
[2017-02-07 20:07:35 UTC] shotinthedeep: yep
[2017-02-07 20:07:36 UTC] dzengo90: This game reminds me of phil incident
[2017-02-07 20:07:42 UTC] shotinthedeep: death counter and facecam
[2017-02-07 20:07:42 UTC] takisq: cool thnx
[2017-02-07 20:07:44 UTC] theycallmejimbob: did you get timed out by the nefarious Nightbot deep?
[2017-02-07 20:07:44 UTC] kingjadvcmp: what incident?
[2017-02-07 20:07:51 UTC] bethe2670: HOLY SHIT, elliot nearly died :D
[2017-02-07 20:07:56 UTC] shotinthedeep: for 10 mins
[2017-02-07 20:07:57 UTC] bethe2670: anyway
[2017-02-07 20:08:00 UTC] rembrandth: How did phil get an extra code anyway? Shouldn
[2017-02-07 20:08:01 UTC] fademadaway: are there difficultys in this game or is there just one called hard as fuck
[2017-02-07 20:08:03 UTC] shotinthedeep: for providing you fuckers with a link
[2017-02-07 20:08:07 UTC] rembrandth: shouldnt he have used it for himself?
[2017-02-07 20:08:09 UTC] manintheblade: yo
[2017-02-07 20:08:11 UTC] urgedcrusher: golden chicken
[2017-02-07 20:08:11 UTC] popsicolo: Phil was just really excited to play the Nioh alpha, guys. KappaHD
[2017-02-07 20:08:18 UTC] dzengo90: lol
[2017-02-07 20:08:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Pops :D
[2017-02-07 20:08:22 UTC] thedudecomeths: If you wait toward the end of the stream to giveaway the game, then you won't have alot of people there to be eligible for it.
[2017-02-07 20:08:25 UTC] zatlovie: i memeber
[2017-02-07 20:08:34 UTC] veronix_x: also there is also DLC for Nioh if you played Last Trial or Alpha version.
[2017-02-07 20:08:37 UTC] fademadaway: i would prefer phil do give away at start of stream
[2017-02-07 20:08:41 UTC] bammbino: this game is more like ninja gaiden and witcher than dark souls IMO.. it does borrow from DS/BB
[2017-02-07 20:08:46 UTC] bethe2670: phil probably jerked off to riley reid x janice griffith :D
[2017-02-07 20:08:46 UTC] dzengo90: yea me too fademeaway
[2017-02-07 20:08:59 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: well the main guy does look like geralt
[2017-02-07 20:09:05 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I THINK Phil perhaps bought the game, and was then given it for free afterwards, meaning there's a spare? Not certain though. Nice to see a rare giveaway though
[2017-02-07 20:09:06 UTC] dzengo90: It would be better he do the giveaway at the start
[2017-02-07 20:09:10 UTC] bammbino: gameplay wise lol
[2017-02-07 20:09:10 UTC] bethe2670: Geralt eh
[2017-02-07 20:09:14 UTC] popsicolo: William is a weeaboo KappaHD

[2017-02-07 20:09:34 UTC] bethe2670: ninja gaiden was hard as fuck though
[2017-02-07 20:09:44 UTC] popsicolo: "I want Asian ass" -Geralt
[2017-02-07 20:09:53 UTC] fademadaway: phil if i donate a lot of bits do i get better chance for the code?
[2017-02-07 20:09:59 UTC] veronix_x: :D
[2017-02-07 20:10:03 UTC] bethe2670: witcher could be hard at points as well but most of the time witcher is fun and fair
[2017-02-07 20:10:04 UTC] n0_h3r0: Geralt got that yellow fever
[2017-02-07 20:10:14 UTC] bethe2670: hey no hero
[2017-02-07 20:10:17 UTC] alex_dragonul: @Bammbino well it is made by the dev team that made the 3d NG games after all so
[2017-02-07 20:10:39 UTC] popsicolo: Didn't this dev also make Metroid: Other M? KappaHD
[2017-02-07 20:10:39 UTC] n0_h3r0: Hiya @bethe2670
[2017-02-07 20:10:40 UTC] antsuni87: hey hey
[2017-02-07 20:10:47 UTC] veronix_x: witcher was a bit tough at the beginning on Death March diff, once you got diagrams and good stuff it became easy.
[2017-02-07 20:10:52 UTC] angelsandairwaves182: hi
[2017-02-07 20:10:56 UTC] encelor: did i come too early?

[2017-02-07 22:07:30 UTC] ands_: Game seems easy? It's the first area. That he's done before.
[2017-02-07 22:07:37 UTC] visceral_: Kojima Wutface ?
[2017-02-07 22:07:41 UTC] hawthorne234: yes it was toned down,

[2017-02-07 22:07:51 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, it was changed cause ogress was too easy and warrior of the east was far too hard
[2017-02-07 22:07:53 UTC] scb3: cause that was had
[2017-02-07 22:07:54 UTC] hawthorne234: he died a tons in the demo here he dont die a all so tahts proof

[2017-02-07 22:08:46 UTC] randomron005: The only problem I had with the Alpha was how fast the weapons broke apart. That said, I'm thankful they listened to the people.
[2017-02-07 22:08:46 UTC] akioartorius: Phil didn't do anything with ninjustus and omnyou magic

[2017-02-07 22:09:14 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, well first thing they did was try to stop enemies from spending stamina like retards and then stopped them from attacking w/o stamina
[2017-02-07 22:09:15 UTC] stillbus: theres no salt I had to bring mine

[2017-02-07 22:09:32 UTC] randomron005: There used to be a mechanic where the weapons & armor broke apart.
[2017-02-07 22:09:36 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Its not that much different at all, anyone saying that it is clearly does not own the game lol

[2017-02-07 22:10:47 UTC] hapticbabyman: Enemies attacking w/o needing stamina would be pretty cheap unless they had an ability to do that.

[2017-02-07 22:10:55 UTC] hawthorne234: pathetic difficulty

[2017-02-07 22:11:35 UTC] hapticbabyman: @hawthorne234 : I think the stamina thing is just for enemies. sounds like they could spam attack w/o stamina in the alpha. They probably fixed that now.

[2017-02-07 23:30:16 UTC] sneaky_vape: isnt that the exact same mini boss from earlier?
[2017-02-07 23:30:20 UTC] subviper: no they wouldnt match
[2017-02-07 23:30:23 UTC] stevotatersdeep: @dsp I'll buy you a PC, PS4 pro and a new telly if you speed up a bit?
[2017-02-07 23:30:23 UTC] hawthorne234: if you got phil saying it then that means something
[2017-02-07 23:30:24 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Not. A. Miniboss.
[2017-02-07 23:30:26 UTC] shotinthedeep: Yes, but they're worth more than what the streamer gets
[2017-02-07 23:30:26 UTC] hapticbabyman: even Phil said it, but he might regret it later...
[2017-02-07 23:30:27 UTC] therealone66: Yup it is
[2017-02-07 23:30:34 UTC] cream_cheese_enema: @Sneaky_Vape, there not minibosses
[2017-02-07 23:30:41 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: They are refular enemies
[2017-02-07 23:30:41 UTC] cream_cheese_enema: literally normal enemies
[2017-02-07 23:30:45 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Regular*
[2017-02-07 23:30:47 UTC] encelor: oni realm creatures
[2017-02-07 23:30:49 UTC] geoabuninja: he doesnt know how to advantage of enemy stagger
[2017-02-07 23:30:50 UTC] xgameofpwns: I'm one of the biggest DS fans and I love this game stop being fanboys and just appreciate that they both are actually good games instead of cod or assassin's creed
[2017-02-07 23:30:51 UTC] kg1772: @Sneaky_Vape just a realm monster. thats what the gray is
[2017-02-07 23:30:53 UTC] tulliuscicero25: that looked like a regular enemy yeah
[2017-02-07 23:30:56 UTC] sneaky_vape: oh okay awesome

[2017-02-07 23:31:17 UTC] tepexy: phil playing this on action mode? anyone knows?
[2017-02-07 23:31:23 UTC] sneaky_vape: thats encouraging actually
[2017-02-07 23:31:25 UTC] butter__my__bread: probably
[2017-02-07 23:31:29 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: its on action mode
[2017-02-07 23:31:37 UTC] bethe2670: assassins creed is a good game
[2017-02-07 23:31:44 UTC] bobbi_ling: Kappa
[2017-02-07 23:31:45 UTC] xgameofpwns: @hawthorne234 right?! they're totally different styles
[2017-02-07 23:31:50 UTC] bethe2670: cod last year was good except multiplayer
[2017-02-07 23:31:51 UTC] bigbadskonk: what is action mode?
[2017-02-07 23:31:56 UTC] kg1772: when there are like 5 or more enemies on the screen each enemy animates at like 15 fps lol
[2017-02-07 23:31:56 UTC] bethe2670: bobbi fuck yo kappa
[2017-02-07 23:31:58 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: 720 60 fps
[2017-02-07 23:32:00 UTC] vypek: its 60fps 720p
[2017-02-07 23:32:02 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Assassins creed 1 is a bad game
[2017-02-07 23:32:05 UTC] hawthorne234: yep
[2017-02-07 23:32:05 UTC] encelor: Kappa
[2017-02-07 23:32:07 UTC] sneaky_vape: theyre not totally different lets be real..
[2017-02-07 23:32:08 UTC] wooooowwe: anyone play rocket league on PC?
[2017-02-07 23:32:12 UTC] hapticbabyman: @hawthorne234 but even DS isn't that hard. Not *really*
[2017-02-07 23:32:20 UTC] tepexy: or 1080 60 on pro
[2017-02-07 23:32:24 UTC] tulliuscicero25: agreed haptic

[2017-02-07 23:32:42 UTC] kg1772: he can shoot that bucket and make fire go away
[2017-02-07 23:32:43 UTC] geoabuninja: assassins creed is good they just abandoned their story so it became why even play
[2017-02-07 23:32:44 UTC] sneaky_vape: but theyre different and i agree shouldnt be compared too much
[2017-02-07 23:32:48 UTC] psxgaming1000: sure he could stop it. wtf
[2017-02-07 23:32:59 UTC] bigbadskonk: so the game is 720p 30 on regular or what?
[2017-02-07 23:33:02 UTC] akioartorius: poisoned
[2017-02-07 23:33:05 UTC] hawthorne234: the difficulty is different
[2017-02-07 23:33:05 UTC] thevanmorgan: didn't you get like a hundred amtidotes?
[2017-02-07 23:33:13 UTC] ziibrah: Bigbadskonk, 720 60fps
[2017-02-07 23:33:18 UTC] subviper: but like, wwith this poison if it was DS he would be long dead
[2017-02-07 23:33:18 UTC] psxgaming1000: hes hideing in the closet
[2017-02-07 23:33:23 UTC] encelor: @Bigbadskonk 720 on 60fps or 1080 on 30 fps
[2017-02-07 23:33:31 UTC] dkmariolink: ofc Phil chooses the most boring fucking weapon >.>
[2017-02-07 23:33:40 UTC] sneaky_vape: from playung the ezio collection i feel assasins creed brotherhood is the best by far
[2017-02-07 23:33:45 UTC] akioartorius: the spear?
[2017-02-07 23:33:47 UTC] bethe2670: a title?
[2017-02-07 23:33:52 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: have you seen all the weapons @dkmariolink?
[2017-02-07 23:33:53 UTC] kg1772: @Dkmariolink he will be forced to switch in some areas bc its shit in some areas and esp against bosses
[2017-02-07 23:33:54 UTC] encelor: @Dkmariolink wut didn't you go?
[2017-02-07 23:33:55 UTC] tulliuscicero25: i expected nothing less!@dkmariolink
[2017-02-07 23:33:56 UTC] encelor: xD
[2017-02-07 23:33:57 UTC] seraphic17: Spears are really good in this
[2017-02-07 23:33:57 UTC] ginosaji48: THE CHEST
[2017-02-07 23:33:58 UTC] psxgaming1000: has he passed the bridge?
[2017-02-07 23:34:00 UTC] bigbadskonk: @encelor ok the action mode is 720 then
[2017-02-07 23:34:03 UTC] pness17: Spearmin
[2017-02-07 23:34:08 UTC] dkmariolink: @mr_vidar_viking, Yeah, Kisa is fucking awesome, he should try it
[2017-02-07 23:34:10 UTC] marpat1993: black flag ?
[2017-02-07 23:34:11 UTC] bethe2670: gino...
[2017-02-07 23:34:11 UTC] tepexy: people in chat playing this game ? how is it
[2017-02-07 23:34:12 UTC] xgameofpwns: AC Black flag was my fav
[2017-02-07 23:34:20 UTC] subviper: ac2
[2017-02-07 23:34:25 UTC] ziibrah: AC Unity was great once they patched everything
[2017-02-07 23:34:25 UTC] lokoboko: how long has phil been streaming?
[2017-02-07 23:34:25 UTC] kinggoken: I wish i had this game...
[2017-02-07 23:34:26 UTC] subviper: nuff said
[2017-02-07 23:34:32 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: fair enough dkmarioliknk
[2017-02-07 23:34:33 UTC] encelor: @Dkmariolink didn't you say you where going to bed?
[2017-02-07 23:34:35 UTC] bethe2670: assassins creed 2 is best
[2017-02-07 23:34:38 UTC] sneaky_vape: the stuff on the ground in black flag was bad imo
[2017-02-07 23:34:39 UTC] hapticbabyman: @tulliuscicero25 DS and stuff is less stressful than some of the 2D action games I've played. I'd rather put up w/ DS over Skullmonkeys atm for instance (Skullmonkeys is a great game but plaformer)
[2017-02-07 23:34:41 UTC] dkmariolink: I said I was closing chat for a bit
[2017-02-07 23:34:44 UTC] marpat1993: rogue was pretty good too
[2017-02-07 23:34:45 UTC] dkmariolink: try reading lol
[2017-02-07 23:34:45 UTC] psxgaming1000: has he done the giveaaway yet?
[2017-02-07 23:34:47 UTC] bethe2670: second best is black flag
[2017-02-07 23:34:47 UTC] encelor: ooh alright
[2017-02-07 23:34:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: about 2 hrs gameplay wise LokoBoko
[2017-02-07 23:34:56 UTC] kinggoken: not yet @psxgaming1000
[2017-02-07 23:34:58 UTC] encelor: @Dkmariolink i saw ppl said bye
[2017-02-07 23:35:00 UTC] akioartorius: end of stream givaway
[2017-02-07 23:35:01 UTC] encelor: that why
[2017-02-07 23:35:08 UTC] bethe2670: rogue was fun
[2017-02-07 23:35:11 UTC] ziibrah: bethe what about unity?
[2017-02-07 23:35:18 UTC] hapticbabyman: I can get used to DS challenge but something like Alien Soldier will always feel beyond my reach
[2017-02-07 23:35:22 UTC] bethe2670: unity sucked ass
[2017-02-07 23:35:22 UTC] lokoboko: thanks jimbob
[2017-02-07 23:35:27 UTC] skysands2017: I guess I'm lucky. Most PS4 games get leaked 1 week early in my country. I don't know how they do it, but I'm fine with that lol Kappa
[2017-02-07 23:35:31 UTC] ziibrah: dammit im like the only one who liked Unity
[2017-02-07 23:35:32 UTC] geoabuninja: death counter didnt go up last death?
[2017-02-07 23:35:35 UTC] bethe2670: 3 sucked too
[2017-02-07 23:35:39 UTC] marpat1993: didnt like the time period in unity
[2017-02-07 23:35:42 UTC] ziibrah: yeah agree on that one
[2017-02-07 23:35:44 UTC] geoabuninja: if not more
[2017-02-07 23:35:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: what country are you from skysands2017 ?
[2017-02-07 23:35:54 UTC] yacherdy: I have audio coming from the my monitor speakers instead of my headphones so I can multitask cleaning my room and damn the sound is tinny.
[2017-02-07 23:35:55 UTC] angelsandairwaves182: i LOVED 3
[2017-02-07 23:35:57 UTC] sneaky_vape: unity would have been amazing if it wasnt complete trash lol.. by that i mean the actual city was amazingly detailed
[2017-02-07 23:35:59 UTC] ziibrah: still haven't played syndicate
[2017-02-07 23:36:05 UTC] psxgaming1000: not sure but the death counter looks glitch is that a 20
[2017-02-07 23:36:07 UTC] bethe2670: unity story was good otherwise it sucked
[2017-02-07 23:36:10 UTC] tulliuscicero25: unity was boring for an interesting time period
[2017-02-07 23:36:13 UTC] skysands2017: Saudi Arabia @theycallmejimbob
[2017-02-07 23:36:16 UTC] bethe2670: syndicate was good

[2017-02-07 23:36:22 UTC] tepexy: 2 deaths? is he doing good or just early in game?
[2017-02-07 23:36:29 UTC] hawthorne234: easy
[2017-02-07 23:36:31 UTC] sneaky_vape: very good point tulli
[2017-02-07 23:36:38 UTC] kg1772: @Tepexy early game is extremely easy
[2017-02-07 23:36:39 UTC] hapticbabyman: he's still in this same area?
[2017-02-07 23:36:41 UTC] hawthorne234: the gam eis just easy
[2017-02-07 23:36:42 UTC] akioartorius: death counter is 2 stop pretending
[2017-02-07 23:36:45 UTC] encelor: @Tepexy so far its been pretty easy

[2017-02-07 23:36:52 UTC] encelor: nothing like darksouls
[2017-02-07 23:37:06 UTC] tulliuscicero25: wish they would leave boring europe and go to the middle east and india
[2017-02-07 23:37:07 UTC] hawthorne234: i am dissapoint
[2017-02-07 23:37:15 UTC] tepexy: well that explains, it does still get difficult right?
[2017-02-07 23:37:23 UTC] xgameofpwns: man, 1 boss per stream? Gonna take him a month at this rate lmao
[2017-02-07 23:37:23 UTC] marpat1993: or asia
[2017-02-07 23:37:23 UTC] tulliuscicero25: and the far east
[2017-02-07 23:37:26 UTC] skysands2017: FROMSOFTWARE is actually making 3 Souls-like games. One is almost finished and will support VR
[2017-02-07 23:37:29 UTC] kg1772: @Tepexy yea it does
[2017-02-07 23:37:31 UTC] cream_cheese_enema: @encelor, it gets difficult as you progress, hes just been on the easiest mission for two hours
[2017-02-07 23:37:32 UTC] geoabuninja: darksouls sint particualrly hard
[2017-02-07 23:37:43 UTC] geoabuninja: only when you dont know what you are doing
[2017-02-07 23:37:43 UTC] hawthorne234: first time it is
[2017-02-07 23:37:45 UTC] bethe2670: vr souls game WutFace
[2017-02-07 23:37:46 UTC] kg1772: he shld use the spirit stones when he levels up they are like the usable souls in dark souls
[2017-02-07 23:37:57 UTC] psxgaming1000: the demo looks better than the actual game
[2017-02-07 23:37:58 UTC] retro_jim_: fall damage? i dont know how much use that will get
[2017-02-07 23:38:00 UTC] akioartorius: he is already doing that
[2017-02-07 23:38:02 UTC] tepexy: skysands source?
[2017-02-07 23:38:04 UTC] stevotatersdeep: A question to phils 150 or so diehard viewers, how do you enjoy Phil long term? He's like watching paint dry!
[2017-02-07 23:38:05 UTC] tulliuscicero25: i remember there was an idea way back for an ac game during the russian revolution. just make that ffs
[2017-02-07 23:38:06 UTC] hawthorne234: BREAK
[2017-02-07 23:38:07 UTC] totallynotaviewbot1992: hey dood
[2017-02-07 23:38:08 UTC] encelor: this game reminds me of a dungeon crawler
[2017-02-07 23:38:15 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: nothing is hard when you're good at it
[2017-02-07 23:38:17 UTC] xgameofpwns: I think DS is harder than this game but I think this game is more fun
[2017-02-07 23:38:19 UTC] sneaky_vape: european history is far from boring but i agree Egypt during the time of the Pharohs or Japan with samurai and ninjas would make me cream myself
[2017-02-07 23:38:26 UTC] skysands2017: 1 minute @Tepexy
[2017-02-07 23:38:32 UTC] geoabuninja: but dark souls was only hard because of the massive shift from casual games you cant ever reach that kind of shift in gameing again
[2017-02-07 23:38:32 UTC] totallynotaviewbot1992: so I just watched this kocc thing
[2017-02-07 23:38:33 UTC] bobbi_ling: phil takes forever lol

[2017-02-07 23:38:49 UTC] hawthorne234: but this game even if you dont know what you are doing its easy
[2017-02-07 23:38:49 UTC] tulliuscicero25: oh im not saying euro history is boring vape
[2017-02-07 23:38:50 UTC] retro_jim_: people play games from different backgrounds and experiences, what is hard or easy is highly varied depending on the person
[2017-02-07 23:38:51 UTC] encelor: @Xgameofpwns i would keep playing this game for loot element
[2017-02-07 23:39:00 UTC] tulliuscicero25: im saying ac makes it boring

[2017-02-07 23:39:27 UTC] bobbi_ling: naked butt guy

[2017-02-07 23:39:39 UTC] bethe2670: lol yacherdy
[2017-02-07 23:39:41 UTC] hapticbabyman: But there were games legit harder than DS at the timeit came out, and before it came out. And since it's come out so..:/
[2017-02-07 23:39:41 UTC] encelor: its a greengo
