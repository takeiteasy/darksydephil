[2017-02-25 19:53:39 UTC] capstonegaming: he had a third party replace it
[2017-02-25 19:53:45 UTC] darksydephil: the faucet was 20 years old and RUSTED ON to the sink. you need power tools to even touch it
[2017-02-25 19:53:49 UTC] capstonegaming: rather than all that other shit
[2017-02-25 19:54:05 UTC] deltaforce355: ok
[2017-02-25 19:54:17 UTC] availableusername888: faucet power tools wtf :D
[2017-02-25 19:54:22 UTC] darksydephil: i was watching what they were doing and it wasn't super complicated, but you do need to knwo what everythign is and have the right tools for the job
[2017-02-25 19:54:31 UTC] soulrider95: They probably just used power tools to make it go faster
[2017-02-25 19:54:45 UTC] capstonegaming: like ur thinnking phils gonna use the axe to cut thru the faucet then have a home furnishings place on speed dial
[2017-02-25 19:55:04 UTC] darksydephil: ok setting up the stream now

[2017-02-25 19:56:54 UTC] podusmonens: no offense, phil, but when you bought the house the 20 year old plumbing wasn't a deterrent?

[2017-02-25 21:02:15 UTC] euffy: I played all of Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne (no moon boss or Chalice stuff). Nameless King has been the nastiest thing, followed by Ludwig and then Pointiff.

[2017-02-25 21:03:10 UTC] himself79: Anyone here tried other weapons than the spear? I mean the spear must be the most effective when it comes to avoid close contact unless you can shoot arrows all the time.
[2017-02-25 21:03:10 UTC] bammbino: @Noflexzone22, we cannot dash alot
[2017-02-25 21:03:21 UTC] xgameofpwns: @Mto2089 im calling at least 300 or a "it's boring" quit
[2017-02-25 21:03:24 UTC] maxbwoy: i think his gonna quit the mission and just do the final main one
[2017-02-25 21:03:27 UTC] bammbino: @himself79, i used all of them
[2017-02-25 21:03:28 UTC] theycallmejimbob: well considering we're nearing 20 deaths after 20 mins of gameplay I assume so Mto2089
[2017-02-25 21:03:30 UTC] jemithagoat: I'll donate to his patreon if he beats this b4 300 deaths
[2017-02-25 21:03:30 UTC] noflexzone22: @bammbino that's not very smart for this boss lmao
