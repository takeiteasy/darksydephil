[2017-02-11 19:44:31 UTC] kingjadvcmp: it wasn't just me, he timed out 10+ people yesterday halfway into pre-stream.
[2017-02-11 19:44:37 UTC] bethe2670: its like gino abuses with me around except gino just plays with me totally difference

[2017-02-11 19:44:57 UTC] kingjadvcmp: of course not
[2017-02-11 19:45:37 UTC] bethe2670: vidar told pops off for unbanning you and pops said it was gino and then vidar told gino off
[2017-02-11 19:45:45 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I know, I saw
[2017-02-11 19:45:59 UTC] bethe2670: i think phil unbans you though or silent
[2017-02-11 19:46:00 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I apologised to Popsic for having vidar call him out like that
[2017-02-11 19:46:15 UTC] bethe2670: hmm
[2017-02-11 19:46:51 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I asked gino or Popsic to unban me cos I broke no rules, and they said they'd consider it - I guessed they saw in my favour. They are aware that vidar does kind of enjoy abusing his position in regards to me, it's become something of a habit.
[2017-02-11 19:47:25 UTC] kingjadvcmp: but it's not really an enjoyable experience when I break no rules and yet bullying by a mod is seemingly allowed just cos they got deep pockets, makes me not want to come back :(

[2017-02-11 19:48:24 UTC] kingjadvcmp: yeah that was funny lol
[2017-02-11 19:48:56 UTC] bethe2670: phil trusts his mods so he would believe them over anyone else but vidar shouldn't abuse power
[2017-02-11 19:49:20 UTC] darksydephil: maybe this argument would stand a bit better if I hadn't personally timed out KingjadVCMP for insults and misbehavior myself in the past
[2017-02-11 19:49:27 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well it helps when the mods witness exactly what happened - Gino and popsic know what vidar did, witnessed it.
[2017-02-11 19:49:29 UTC] darksydephil: you're no angel, bro
[2017-02-11 19:49:31 UTC] bethe2670: oh hey phil :P

[2017-02-11 20:10:47 UTC] darksydephil: like, you can't technically be a 7 month sub until 7 months pass

[2017-02-11 20:11:28 UTC] darksydephil: just because you buy a sub for 7 months doesn't earn you the badge, the time actually has to elapse, i guess

[2017-02-11 20:11:43 UTC] popsicolo: Seems that way

[2017-02-11 20:25:28 UTC] dukesdearfreja: Side content on this game is as fun as having kidney stones

[2017-02-11 20:26:00 UTC] xgameofpwns: the twilight mission is on par with your level today so you can get good loot
[2017-02-11 20:26:05 UTC] alex_dragonul: Any of you people is having problem with Google+ ? like the notification bell , is not a bell is a black circle and i it doesn't show me anything anymore when i try to click on it , and when i go to try and change a setting in google+ i can't is just looked . It happened out of nowhere when i opened the internet last tow hours ago .
[2017-02-11 20:26:05 UTC] kg1772: dojo
[2017-02-11 20:26:11 UTC] akioartorius: @DarksydePhil I disagree. The duel with Tachibana Muneshige was a side mission,
[2017-02-11 20:26:26 UTC] yacherdy: I am comfy
[2017-02-11 20:26:26 UTC] darksydephil: well thats true i guess
[2017-02-11 20:26:29 UTC] yacherdy: No pants and balls are out
[2017-02-11 20:26:33 UTC] darksydephil: so, out of like the 8 side missions ive done, one was good lol
[2017-02-11 20:26:38 UTC] dukesdearfreja: Lol
[2017-02-11 20:26:46 UTC] availableusername888: so i missed a good portion of game, how far is he in this?
[2017-02-11 20:26:52 UTC] darksydephil: sadly it seems like this game has a LOT of padding
[2017-02-11 20:26:54 UTC] elipsion: You have like 5 out of 18 story missions done, they will severely outlevel you later
[2017-02-11 20:26:59 UTC] akioartorius: There will be more of those
[2017-02-11 20:26:59 UTC] darksydephil: 60 hours but 40+ hours are just the side bullshit
[2017-02-11 20:27:05 UTC] dukesdearfreja: You want true good, non repetitive side content? Try mafia 3 @darksydephil Kappa
[2017-02-11 20:27:07 UTC] elipsion: Even with side content you cant keep up but it isnt hard
[2017-02-11 20:27:15 UTC] bbt_2016: you dont have to do side missions just look at ur lvl n make sure you meet the minimum grind if needed
[2017-02-11 20:27:19 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I have a celebration to go to. so I will see you later
[2017-02-11 20:27:25 UTC] ginosaji48: hope there will be at least one more Tachibana like boss in the game
[2017-02-11 20:27:26 UTC] yacherdy: bye vidar
[2017-02-11 20:27:28 UTC] bradleymason1993: i dont mind side content as long as its interesting, if it is just more grinding then yeah, sounds boring
[2017-02-11 20:27:37 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: see ya yasherdy
[2017-02-11 20:27:39 UTC] dukesdearfreja: It isn't that interesting
[2017-02-11 20:27:39 UTC] mrvaguetv: I hate how they penalise you foe not using your main weapons. My spear and axe combo is getting boring
[2017-02-11 20:27:40 UTC] ginosaji48: bye
[2017-02-11 20:27:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: cya vidar

[2017-02-11 20:27:44 UTC] marktactics: @availableusername888 About 20%
[2017-02-11 20:27:50 UTC] splitplaythru: why are you so quick to disregard side content, man
[2017-02-11 20:27:57 UTC] availableusername888: @Marktactics really?
[2017-02-11 20:27:59 UTC] yacherdy: side content is good in a game like this
[2017-02-11 20:28:02 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: bye :)
[2017-02-11 20:28:19 UTC] darksydephil: yeah it seems you're kind of locked into your weapon loadout for hte game's length unless you respec? unless i'm wrong but it seems putting points into skill, which was my weapon specialization, helps tons while oter stuff barely does anything
[2017-02-11 20:28:32 UTC] iconicmaster1: Tenchu
[2017-02-11 20:28:35 UTC] senci1880: How bout them Patriots

[2017-02-11 20:28:57 UTC] xgameofpwns: respec books are easy to get
[2017-02-11 20:28:58 UTC] dukesdearfreja: @darksydephil Skill mainly accounts for ranged weapons, I have no clue why it's levelling so much for you? Weird
[2017-02-11 20:29:12 UTC] darksydephil: because i picked that specialization at the start,?
[2017-02-11 20:29:13 UTC] bethe2670: flatout 4?
[2017-02-11 20:29:17 UTC] darksydephil: i think spears are skill scalin
[2017-02-11 20:29:19 UTC] bethe2670: is that a fallout dlc
[2017-02-11 20:29:23 UTC] alex_dragonul: Phil what happened , you had to banned a guy from KoGaming ?
[2017-02-11 20:29:33 UTC] dukesdearfreja: @darksydephil oh okay I thought they were dexterity, my bad
[2017-02-11 20:29:34 UTC] splitplaythru: nope, skill scaling is for dual swords
[2017-02-11 20:29:40 UTC] elipsion: Nah skill always levels like that but you hit the softcap at 25
[2017-02-11 20:29:44 UTC] darksydephil: 2 out of he 3 things that i picked in the intro were skill specializations
[2017-02-11 20:29:47 UTC] ladypeorth: Each weapon has different scaling (listed on the weapon with a letter grade). Spears scale with Body B, Skill C, and Strength C, but these letters go up and down based on the base spear
[2017-02-11 20:29:54 UTC] iconicmaster1: Anyone seen dark souls 3 second dlc
[2017-02-11 20:30:03 UTC] splitplaythru: it says so under each stat you want to upgrade
[2017-02-11 20:30:05 UTC] darksydephil: aha that makes sense LadyPeorth thanks
[2017-02-11 20:30:15 UTC] dukesdearfreja: Ah that probably explains it then Phil, just keep levelling Skill or stamina for that equip load for heavier armour
[2017-02-11 20:30:25 UTC] ladypeorth: Likewise, your familiarity (how much you use a weapon) increases the damage it does AND the bonuses it has may also scale
[2017-02-11 20:30:34 UTC] kg1772: ninjitsu is really good. poisen is kinda OP against large enemies
[2017-02-11 20:30:44 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Phil any update on making a political discussion series?
[2017-02-11 20:30:51 UTC] dukesdearfreja: @ladypeorth aren't you Nelsons mod?
[2017-02-11 20:30:51 UTC] dubstepzombie62: You should play with light armor Phil, it's better than medium or heavy
[2017-02-11 20:31:05 UTC] ladypeorth: I am
[2017-02-11 20:31:05 UTC] ginosaji48: Phil did you officialy drop the game that we can not talk about ?

[2017-02-11 22:24:55 UTC] bammbino: @bbt_2016, there will be a point where phil says the game is repeating missions too often and then focus on the story to then get his ass kicked cause of the lack of grind
[2017-02-11 22:25:05 UTC] yacherdy: cmonBruh
[2017-02-11 22:25:06 UTC] coldkiller86: Picola is kinki for phil

[2017-02-11 22:25:41 UTC] quaseemoto: this fan art is kind of terrible.....
[2017-02-11 22:25:43 UTC] bammbino: @shotinthedeep, what part of the game are you at?
[2017-02-11 22:25:43 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Remember when square enix tried to pull that shit with deus ex? 'Everyone pre order now and we might release 4 days early!'

[2017-02-11 22:26:27 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: I hate what square enix are doing to deus ex. Running a great series into the ground and turning it into a mindless cash grab franchise.
[2017-02-11 22:26:33 UTC] bammbino: @YaCherdy, my drink of choice is nesquik
[2017-02-11 22:26:41 UTC] bethe2670: tanya tates video?

[2017-02-11 22:27:06 UTC] twitchstuzster: Who really gives a fuck about 4 extra days. Are people really that desperate? Do publishers think we are that desperate? I guess the answer is, sadly, 'yes'...
[2017-02-11 22:27:08 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Lol

[2017-02-11 22:27:57 UTC] kinggoken: lol @DrGreenThumb_NZ
[2017-02-11 22:28:00 UTC] bbt_2016: sum1 tell phil to check amrita memories tab then find scenario to see how far he is he needs a visual playing at this rate

[2017-02-11 22:28:19 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: @bammbino I refused to buy it and play it because of the episodic release. I wont support that at all. What are your thoughts on it?
[2017-02-11 22:28:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no still here DrGreenThumb_NZ
[2017-02-11 22:28:33 UTC] theycallmejimbob: that was a little strange to say the least YaCherdy
[2017-02-11 22:28:36 UTC] quaseemoto: Below 400 viewers hype
[2017-02-11 22:28:43 UTC] quaseemoto: lost a 100 people in 5 minutes hype
[2017-02-11 22:28:52 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob yes but I must admit it was hilarious
[2017-02-11 22:28:55 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: no biggie
[2017-02-11 22:29:05 UTC] kinggoken: tanya tate is alright looking

[2017-02-11 22:29:32 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Lol jk
[2017-02-11 22:29:33 UTC] bammbino: @fuzzyblumpkinz, gonna be honest with ya here.. i will never buy a trashy episodic game like what those walking dead game devs do.. but hitman's new business model actually makes sense cause the story was always bland and boring aswell as having missions that had so much filler
[2017-02-11 22:29:34 UTC] ginosaji48: Tanya is one of my favorite actresses
[2017-02-11 22:29:39 UTC] yacherdy: bethe is a nice young man
[2017-02-11 22:29:40 UTC] bethe2670: im not a troll :(

[2017-02-11 22:30:34 UTC] quaseemoto: DSP
[2017-02-11 22:30:38 UTC] bethe2670: basement dwelling
[2017-02-11 22:30:42 UTC] ginosaji48: well, we were chatting there and she said my name, thats why jimbob
[2017-02-11 22:30:42 UTC] bammbino: @fuzzyblumpkinz, give me the tools and let me CHOOSE how to take out the targets is such a cool theme for it -- theres tons of vids on YT where people have killed them in fucked up ways that phil never experienced
[2017-02-11 22:30:42 UTC] kinggoken: lol
[2017-02-11 22:30:48 UTC] picola122: dsp you are the best streamer ever
[2017-02-11 22:30:54 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: they call it exposing
[2017-02-11 22:30:57 UTC] yacherdy: @Ginosaji48 Would you pick Phil or Tanya?
[2017-02-11 22:30:59 UTC] willem12982: @kinggoken lots of views
[2017-02-11 22:30:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah nice Ginosaji48 :D
[2017-02-11 22:31:08 UTC] ginosaji48: tanya
[2017-02-11 22:31:12 UTC] yacherdy: DBstyle
[2017-02-11 22:31:15 UTC] sanguinenite: I like Phil because he is the little guy on youtube
[2017-02-11 22:31:15 UTC] yacherdy: how dare you
[2017-02-11 22:31:15 UTC] quaseemoto: KWO
[2017-02-11 22:31:17 UTC] kinggoken: yeah views could be a factor
[2017-02-11 22:31:24 UTC] bethe2670: 'ginosaji48' then you orgasmed in your pants right gino
[2017-02-11 22:31:31 UTC] theycallmejimbob: uhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[2017-02-11 22:31:33 UTC] bethe2670: :O Kreygasm
[2017-02-11 22:31:42 UTC] kinggoken: I feel dsp should be a lot bigger than what he is
[2017-02-11 22:31:43 UTC] yacherdy: gino I heard Tanya is espeically into BIG Czech cock
[2017-02-11 22:31:46 UTC] tulliuscicero25: "the little guy" lmao
[2017-02-11 22:31:53 UTC] kinggoken: like as big as Pewdiepie or whatever his name is
[2017-02-11 22:31:55 UTC] ginosaji48: .......
[2017-02-11 22:31:56 UTC] bethe2670: yacherdy dspHmm
[2017-02-11 22:32:07 UTC] bethe2670: pewDIEfuck
[2017-02-11 22:32:12 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: @bammbino I agree 100%. I remember how amazing hitman absolutions story looked from the trailers, then we got that over the top style that made no sense. Not a bad game, but not really hitmans style. I just wish devs would stop being so lazy and money hungry and make a truly great game that makes people WANT to hand over their money over and over again.
[2017-02-11 22:32:21 UTC] bammbino: @Kinggoken, phil seems to be better off with a smaller fan base
[2017-02-11 22:32:26 UTC] quaseemoto: Phil would of been "a lot bigger" if he Paid John Rambo, Howard, And Respect The PAct
[2017-02-11 22:32:36 UTC] sanguinenite: yeah if dsp became the next pewbs I will probably stop watching phil
[2017-02-11 22:32:40 UTC] sanguinenite: I dont think so
[2017-02-11 22:32:44 UTC] yacherdy: John Rambo and Howard and OJ :(
[2017-02-11 22:32:46 UTC] sanguinenite: I hated Project 7
[2017-02-11 22:32:47 UTC] kinggoken: who is this rambo person? I see people keep mentioning him
[2017-02-11 22:33:00 UTC] yacherdy: no idea
[2017-02-11 22:33:05 UTC] ibedavey: Rambo was JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHN
[2017-02-11 22:33:14 UTC] drgreenthumb_nz: phil ex friend
[2017-02-11 22:33:18 UTC] bethe2670: phils ex best friend
[2017-02-11 22:33:20 UTC] ibedavey: CAHMAN D00D you forgot JAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHN!??
[2017-02-11 22:33:21 UTC] picola122: dsp is unique
[2017-02-11 22:33:24 UTC] ibedavey: the hell
[2017-02-11 22:33:28 UTC] tulliuscicero25: phil's humor is pretty on level with pew though
[2017-02-11 22:33:32 UTC] quaseemoto: One of DSP's 2 only friends he had left in his 30's
[2017-02-11 22:33:42 UTC] sanguinenite: I couldnt even watch the first video of Project 7. It looked so.... low budget
[2017-02-11 22:33:42 UTC] bammbino: @quaseemoto, i know people love rambo, i liked the dual commentary too.. but face it, phil said alot of things that offended people over the years but didnt really mean it i think
[2017-02-11 22:33:44 UTC] kinggoken: i guess his friends turned on him
[2017-02-11 22:33:46 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: truly one of a kind in the whole world
[2017-02-11 22:33:57 UTC] yacherdy: bethe is Phil and I am Rambo
[2017-02-11 22:33:59 UTC] tulliuscicero25: his jokes make me question his age sometimes
[2017-02-11 22:34:02 UTC] sanguinenite: I think his friends were just jealous
[2017-02-11 22:34:09 UTC] ibedavey: lets be real for a sec
[2017-02-11 22:34:15 UTC] ibedavey: we don't watch Phil for the jokes
[2017-02-11 22:34:17 UTC] bethe2670: yacherdy so you will turn on me
[2017-02-11 22:34:21 UTC] picola122: dsp you are my inspiration
[2017-02-11 22:34:24 UTC] ibedavey: it's the rage and shit XD
[2017-02-11 22:34:25 UTC] yacherdy: @bethe2670 .....
[2017-02-11 22:34:26 UTC] tulliuscicero25: oh yeah ibedavey
[2017-02-11 22:34:30 UTC] quaseemoto: @Bammbino doesn't make it right tbh, and apologies don't mean jack if you keep on doing what you keep apologizing for
[2017-02-11 22:34:31 UTC] yacherdy: thats your side of the story.
[2017-02-11 22:34:34 UTC] bammbino: @quaseemoto, i felt betrayed when his response to not playing KH 2.8 was "how about this, i dont care about it or the story" but i moved on and im still here
[2017-02-11 22:34:34 UTC] kinggoken: the rage is hilarious. I admit that.
[2017-02-11 22:34:52 UTC] sanguinenite: Phil's jokes sometimes is a hit or miss but I watch hoping he will go back to his glory days of 2011 and before that
[2017-02-11 22:35:09 UTC] ibedavey: I watch him for the rage XD
[2017-02-11 22:35:09 UTC] sanguinenite: I find the rage boring
[2017-02-11 22:35:10 UTC] kinggoken: one time someone was watching me play Kingdom Hearts and that person legit asked me why I was playing a Mickey Mouse game! Legit laughed.
[2017-02-11 22:35:18 UTC] lostczeech: phil just treated his friends bad...thats why he is alone now
[2017-02-11 22:35:20 UTC] ibedavey: hence "TIHYDP" but I still enjoy Phil
[2017-02-11 22:35:31 UTC] sanguinenite: No, his friend left him alone because he moved
[2017-02-11 22:35:36 UTC] stinkinburrows: But was it legit?
[2017-02-11 22:35:37 UTC] quaseemoto: that montage on KOGaming is trash though
[2017-02-11 22:35:51 UTC] ibedavey: good thing others make montages then
[2017-02-11 22:35:57 UTC] bammbino: montage and DSP dont mix, just my opinion
[2017-02-11 22:36:03 UTC] sanguinenite: I am sure Rambo wouldnt have had the balls to tell Phil in his face what Rambo and OJ said on their own video
[2017-02-11 22:36:06 UTC] visionz89: Yoooooo
[2017-02-11 22:36:08 UTC] lostczeech: you can find on youtube explanation from jambo, howard and oj
[2017-02-11 22:36:14 UTC] lostczeech: rambo
[2017-02-11 22:36:16 UTC] yacherdy: inb4 Phil comes in chat and says talk about something else EleGiggle
[2017-02-11 22:36:20 UTC] sanguinenite: I saw that already
[2017-02-11 22:36:21 UTC] visionz89: Rambo that big nose
[2017-02-11 22:36:23 UTC] kinggoken: DSP should try to bring this Rambo person back into the fold
[2017-02-11 22:36:33 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I hope there isn't gonna be a purge YaCherdy :(
[2017-02-11 22:36:34 UTC] sanguinenite: Why should he?
[2017-02-11 22:36:36 UTC] yacherdy: I agree king
[2017-02-11 22:36:36 UTC] quaseemoto: @sanguinenite Rambo asked Phil to call him a year and a half ago and he never did...
[2017-02-11 22:36:44 UTC] kinggoken: why not. They were friends at one point.
[2017-02-11 22:36:45 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob BibleThump
[2017-02-11 22:36:47 UTC] unboshable: phil isnt the greatest dude def said sone dumb things but people have literally devoted their lives to try to ruin him its depressing tbh
[2017-02-11 22:36:48 UTC] visionz89: Rambo and dsp were a good duo
[2017-02-11 22:36:51 UTC] akioartorius: too much contrversy to do that
[2017-02-11 22:36:59 UTC] sanguinenite: I heard the reverse from Phil and how Phil tried to contact him for a co-op
[2017-02-11 22:37:04 UTC] bethe2670: for the last time *boom*- shaun, I FUCKING KNEW IT - ed, ok *takes dart out of head* but dogs can look up - shaun....hah gotta love shaun of the dead :D classic
[2017-02-11 22:37:13 UTC] style_562: Dam he still fapping?
[2017-02-11 22:37:20 UTC] lostczeech: yep..he never contacted rambo after video
[2017-02-11 22:37:21 UTC] kinggoken: he is probably eating
[2017-02-11 22:37:30 UTC] yacherdy: Shaun of the Dead is awesome especially because it has a Smiths song in it
[2017-02-11 22:37:31 UTC] quaseemoto: @sanguinenite Yeah Rambo and Howard felt the only time Phil contacted them was about money. And thats not really a friendship tbh
[2017-02-11 22:37:36 UTC] unboshable: hope he and rambo makeup
[2017-02-11 22:37:38 UTC] bisskits: Come on guys...Phil already told you it was all their faults he was completely in the right 103% of the time.
[2017-02-11 22:37:44 UTC] bammbino: im not white knighting anyone.. but i think you guys gotta chill on the rambo talk before people start getting banned
[2017-02-11 22:37:44 UTC] bethe2670: yacherdy yup
[2017-02-11 22:37:46 UTC] drgreenthumb_nz: phil read out personal texts from rambo to youtube
[2017-02-11 22:37:53 UTC] sanguinenite: But I think Phil didnt give a shit about contacting them since Rambo and OJ were just in Project 7 for the money
[2017-02-11 22:37:54 UTC] ginosaji48: enough
[2017-02-11 22:38:00 UTC] yacherdy: lel
[2017-02-11 22:38:03 UTC] kinggoken: what did @quaseemoto say? Its deleted.

[2017-02-11 22:38:22 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeah that was a dumb move by Phil but why should we be surprised, DrGreenThumb
[2017-02-11 22:38:28 UTC] bethe2670: who did yacherdy imma kill em
[2017-02-11 22:38:32 UTC] sanguinenite: He is taking a dump, maybe

[2017-02-11 23:05:15 UTC] quaseemoto: Well i don't want to hear complaints about views when his fighting style is deliberately driving people away
[2017-02-11 23:05:17 UTC] mfd4419: Don't eat my butt

[2017-02-11 23:06:02 UTC] yacherdy: This is me personally: I like playthroughs where he is enjoying himself rather than rage. Like Mass Effect 2 > Dark Souls
[2017-02-11 23:06:05 UTC] mfd4419: Don't eat it no
[2017-02-11 23:06:10 UTC] scoopula: cheer15

[2017-02-11 23:07:50 UTC] yacherdy: @Bammbino honestly some rage seems forced to me....other times when its legit its entertaining. but mostly I usually enjoy stuff he clearly is enjoying himself.
[2017-02-11 23:07:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: does Phil still think this game is easy bethe2670?

[2017-02-11 23:08:57 UTC] bethe2670: he only had one boss which fucked him up 25 times all the other bosses were cheap deaths like the centipede and the big slug thing
[2017-02-11 23:09:17 UTC] ginosaji48: all this waiting for the boss http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/11/killself.gif
