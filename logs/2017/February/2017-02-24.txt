[2017-02-24 19:08:45 UTC] bethe2670: Phil said on Twitter "Folks, today I am at the mercy of a plumber's arrival. So far, no word from them but supposed to be here within 2 hours. The wait begins..."
[2017-02-24 19:08:50 UTC] bethe2670: dspHmm

[2017-02-24 19:47:04 UTC] bethe2670: yacherdy we are your lovely friends man
[2017-02-24 19:47:13 UTC] bethe2670: why you so sad today :(
[2017-02-24 19:47:22 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you mean you broke the handle of the window or the pane of glass bethe?
[2017-02-24 19:47:29 UTC] kingjadvcmp: what did people think of Phil's vlogs?
[2017-02-24 19:48:00 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob well i close the window and then the wind can blow it open easily
[2017-02-24 19:48:07 UTC] bethe2670: which it shouldn't do at all
[2017-02-24 19:48:22 UTC] bethe2670: kingjad they are good
[2017-02-24 19:48:26 UTC] yacherdy: Nothing I just have totally have fallen out of love with Phil's videos these past couple years..plus him calling me an idiot multiple times doesn't help. But like I said I love talking to you guys. Only reason I stick around.
[2017-02-24 19:48:42 UTC] bethe2670: :D
[2017-02-24 19:48:43 UTC] bethe2670: awww
[2017-02-24 19:48:44 UTC] kingjadvcmp: that's a shame YaCherdy, honestly
[2017-02-24 19:48:54 UTC] bethe2670: he calls everyone a idiot lol
[2017-02-24 19:49:03 UTC] theycallmejimbob: we've all been called idiots before YaCherdy don't take it to heart.
[2017-02-24 19:49:10 UTC] bethe2670: look what he did to dragin lol called him a troll
[2017-02-24 19:49:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: and I agree with Kingjad that it would be a shame if you left completely
[2017-02-24 19:49:50 UTC] yacherdy: I know but it doesn't mean I have to take it...:(
[2017-02-24 19:49:51 UTC] yacherdy: :(
[2017-02-24 19:50:03 UTC] kingjadvcmp: bethe, the vlogs left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. He said things like he knew the t-shirts he tried to sell last year weren't good. Why on Earth did he do it then?
[2017-02-24 19:50:10 UTC] bethe2670: ignore phil when he says things like that
[2017-02-24 19:50:14 UTC] bethe2670: to be honest
[2017-02-24 19:50:23 UTC] kingjadvcmp: he seems happy to just try and sell anything, not caring for the quality of the product in question - that's an awful mentality for a businessman IMO
[2017-02-24 19:50:25 UTC] yacherdy: I get why I got "yelled" at but it should have stopped there
[2017-02-24 19:50:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil can be rude,crude, abrasive and quick to anger at times YaCherdy but that's all part of his charm on a side note I'm a sadomasochist
[2017-02-24 19:50:59 UTC] yacherdy: Again, I'm probably being oversensitive and ridcilous but thats how I am.
[2017-02-24 19:51:15 UTC] bethe2670: i agree he shouldn't say bad words at people a simple 'STOP' will suffice
[2017-02-24 19:51:15 UTC] yacherdy: ridiculous*
[2017-02-24 19:51:28 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I've said for a good while that to be a fan of Phil you probably have to enjoy a certain amount of abuse lol
[2017-02-24 19:52:36 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it's not nice YaCherdy I agree but he has never been one to mince his words
[2017-02-24 19:53:02 UTC] yacherdy: Calling me a "kid" when I'm 25...anyways thanks for the consolation, guys. You guys are still awesome.
[2017-02-24 19:53:06 UTC] yacherdy: Oh I know jimbob
[2017-02-24 19:53:20 UTC] bethe2670: 1.interaction, especially sexual activity, in which one person enjoys inflicting physical or mental suffering on another person, who derives pleasure from experiencing pain.2. gratification, especially sexual, gained through inflicting or receiving pain; sadism and masochism combined. that is what you are jimbob?
[2017-02-24 19:53:25 UTC] bethe2670: dspHmm
[2017-02-24 19:53:35 UTC] kingjadvcmp: 'treat others how you'd want to be treated yourself' is my outlook in life. Phil would surely not enjoy it if his fans talked to him like he's talked to them sometimes. All about putting yourself in others' shoes.
[2017-02-24 19:53:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: It might of been a tongue in cheek comment bethe2670 NotLikeThis
[2017-02-24 19:53:49 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob :D
[2017-02-24 19:53:57 UTC] bethe2670: now i will never forget this
[2017-02-24 19:54:24 UTC] ginosaji48: ok im back, damn i was taking a little walk down the hall and i met one girl and i was like "dat ass"

[2017-02-24 19:55:55 UTC] encelor: good man thanks :)
[2017-02-24 19:56:25 UTC] bethe2670: i can imagine a guy hobbling down a hallway and looking back at a girl with the 'hot damn' expression on his face whilst looking at her ass
[2017-02-24 19:56:26 UTC] bethe2670: :D
[2017-02-24 19:56:45 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Gino probably had a chat-up line in mind like 'now I'm feeling doubly stiff'
[2017-02-24 19:56:59 UTC] bethe2670: lol
[2017-02-24 19:57:03 UTC] yacherdy: Gino should I move to Pilsen or Liberec?

[2017-02-24 22:37:05 UTC] podusmonens: he sees the city as filthy and whatnot. basically because he always drives at nght thorugh shady neighbourhoods, the shadies parts of NY.
[2017-02-24 22:37:11 UTC] yacherdy: Like his mind was so fried up to that point that he saw the city from his own perspective?

[2017-02-24 22:38:43 UTC] podusmonens: the famous line is "talkin' to me?" but what he says after that is the actual core of the movie "I'm the only one here" it's a movie about loneliness (according to someone's analysis(
[2017-02-24 22:39:11 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah...I can agree with that.
[2017-02-24 22:39:34 UTC] yacherdy: PTSD shit
