[2017-02-27 19:01:21 UTC] yacherdy: Was the fuck up with Leo and Emma Stone or whatever?
[2017-02-27 19:01:30 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: He wasn't writing the card he read of though
[2017-02-27 19:01:33 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: as i understand it
[2017-02-27 19:01:46 UTC] betheboom: the fuck was la la land winning over moonligh
[2017-02-27 19:01:53 UTC] yacherdy: I don't ever watch awards shows
[2017-02-27 19:01:57 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, he never looked at the card
[2017-02-27 19:01:58 UTC] yacherdy: well maybe besides AVN Kappa
[2017-02-27 19:02:10 UTC] blue_blur64: As the guy clearly showed that Moonlight won LUL
[2017-02-27 19:02:18 UTC] blue_blur64: on the card I mean
[2017-02-27 19:02:30 UTC] mynameismrrobot: Steve Harvey? Kappa
[2017-02-27 19:02:31 UTC] betheboom: he got given the wrong card
[2017-02-27 19:02:33 UTC] betheboom: :D
[2017-02-27 19:02:38 UTC] betheboom: not his fault
[2017-02-27 19:02:42 UTC] yacherdy: FAIL...(dot org)
[2017-02-27 19:02:48 UTC] blue_blur64: No, he never looked at the card
[2017-02-27 19:02:51 UTC] dxfreedom: nuthing he could do, online lag.
[2017-02-27 19:02:54 UTC] yacherdy: bugged card mechanics
[2017-02-27 19:02:57 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Except the card said best female actor or something
[2017-02-27 19:03:08 UTC] blue_blur64: When the guy said that it was incorrect, he pulled the card out of the envelope
[2017-02-27 19:03:15 UTC] blue_blur64: and it said Moonlight
[2017-02-27 19:03:34 UTC] betheboom: he didnt even say la la land won didnt the woman say it
[2017-02-27 19:03:46 UTC] blue_blur64: No the guy said it
[2017-02-27 19:03:52 UTC] betheboom: oh
[2017-02-27 19:03:58 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: It's almost like I could suspect that they would stage such a thing. Just to make publicity
[2017-02-27 19:03:59 UTC] betheboom: hmm
[2017-02-27 19:04:17 UTC] blue_blur64: Well first he almost forgot what the award was even for
[2017-02-27 19:04:21 UTC] darksydephil: from what i saw, they handed warren beatty the wrong envelope, it was again the best actress envelope and he looked at the card like WTF, this says emma stone for lala land
[2017-02-27 19:04:30 UTC] darksydephil: and then they just said la la land thinking it was a misprint o rsomething
[2017-02-27 19:04:46 UTC] dxfreedom: Its was pretty darn awkward xD
[2017-02-27 19:04:50 UTC] darksydephil: then someone found the right envelope lol
[2017-02-27 19:05:02 UTC] darksydephil: its jsut stupid human error and people being lazy, not checking wtf they'r edoing. it happens
[2017-02-27 19:05:11 UTC] mynameismrrobot: At least Moonlight won in the end lol
[2017-02-27 19:05:18 UTC] darksydephil: just like how in the tribute to those who died this year they had a picture of a woman who's still alive lol!
[2017-02-27 19:05:26 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: haha
[2017-02-27 19:05:28 UTC] blue_blur64: wait really? O_o

[2017-02-27 19:05:59 UTC] darksydephil: they got the name right but used a pic of one of the woman's IRL friends who is also in the industry because nobody fact checked anything
[2017-02-27 19:06:08 UTC] betheboom: those morons JUST MADE THE LIST
[2017-02-27 19:06:21 UTC] blue_blur64: Does the list even exist anymore?

[2017-02-27 19:08:47 UTC] blue_blur64: It's strange that the editing you did for the patron list kept the audio
[2017-02-27 19:08:59 UTC] capstonegaming: the same thing happened to me phil
[2017-02-27 19:09:03 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: It makes it a tiny bit better with audio to be fair
[2017-02-27 19:09:12 UTC] capstonegaming: I streaed 2 hours of way of the samurai and it had no audio for no aparent reason
[2017-02-27 19:09:13 UTC] bammbino: late!!

[2017-02-27 19:09:43 UTC] yacherdy: to be honest I think all WIP
[2017-02-27 19:09:51 UTC] yacherdy: s should be abridged like that
[2017-02-27 19:09:52 UTC] capstonegaming: so i put the old fashioned filter on it and called "silent prologue"
[2017-02-27 19:09:55 UTC] betheboom: /me pre-ordered and pre-installed Horizon Zero Dawn for WEDNESDAY

[2017-02-27 19:12:06 UTC] darksydephil: gotta love the net tards out there. every video is now getting spammed with comments saying "advertiser unfriendly!" despite Machinima blatantly saying that's not what the issue is with ads on dspgaming.
[2017-02-27 19:12:13 UTC] blue_blur64: The original ME
[2017-02-27 19:12:14 UTC] capstonegaming: (tghrows bethe into flatscreen shattering the screen)

[2017-02-27 19:13:26 UTC] rosefox911: @DarksydePhil Not sure what you expect when you made a video saying they claim you are advertiser unfriendly.

[2017-02-27 19:14:51 UTC] yacherdy: bethe and gino :(
[2017-02-27 19:14:57 UTC] yacherdy: that bridge is forever burned
[2017-02-27 19:14:58 UTC] capstonegaming: everytime he reads the source of stress to his business people use it
[2017-02-27 19:15:01 UTC] masternutella: Whats HZD?
[2017-02-27 19:15:02 UTC] blue_blur64: How do people have the game today anyway?
[2017-02-27 19:15:08 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I could see ads as per usual on your dsp gaming channel when I watched it earlier
[2017-02-27 19:15:08 UTC] betheboom: remember yesterday gino me x you Kappa

[2017-02-27 19:15:18 UTC] capstonegaming: "People always go over to kogaming just to crap on everything" now its tough to find a video that has more likes than dislikes
[2017-02-27 19:15:21 UTC] masternutella: Ah
[2017-02-27 19:15:24 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Didnt u take like 2 mins to find the word and it was "advertiser unfriendly"?
[2017-02-27 19:15:34 UTC] darksydephil: wow
[2017-02-27 19:15:34 UTC] capstonegaming: the first thing i think is "Have i crapped on it yet?"
[2017-02-27 19:15:42 UTC] bammbino: @mr_vidar_viking, maybe its a region thing? im usa and still cannot see ads for him
[2017-02-27 19:15:47 UTC] darksydephil: some of you REALLY, REALLY weren't listening to the video at all. that's shockingly bad
[2017-02-27 19:15:57 UTC] fatlock88: Phil focus on story today
[2017-02-27 19:16:05 UTC] betheboom: it wasnt loooove, it wasnt loooove, it was a PERFECT ILLUSION

[2017-02-27 19:16:08 UTC] capstonegaming: and reading machinimas letter isnt good cuz ur exposing where the business is vulnerable now ppl will attack it
[2017-02-27 19:16:10 UTC] masternutella: Side mission are fun
[2017-02-27 19:16:10 UTC] darksydephil: like, you have to be moronic to get that out of the video when i outright said "machinima says it is NOT this"
[2017-02-27 19:16:11 UTC] capstonegaming: (sogh)
[2017-02-27 19:16:15 UTC] yacherdy: bethe did you write that

[2017-02-27 19:16:28 UTC] blue_blur64: @mrmarlboroz, He did, but that was to explain the thing that IS NOT happening to him
[2017-02-27 19:16:30 UTC] betheboom: yacherdy naaaah gaga did
[2017-02-27 19:16:31 UTC] aglet57: Completely forgot about the new time! lol. Hey guys!

[2017-02-27 19:17:18 UTC] aglet57: what's going on @YaCherdy
[2017-02-27 19:17:33 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Is it really the rage that people love/hate about Phil? Honestly, there are far worse fits and tantrums in Twitch than Phil's :P
[2017-02-27 19:17:38 UTC] yacherdy: nothing much, just trying to get rid of this sickness I picked up last night...DayQuil and water ftw
[2017-02-27 19:17:38 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: It's what people guess is the problem. Because it is the most likely culprit to lost adrevenie I guess
[2017-02-27 19:17:42 UTC] aglet57: any update from Machinima?
[2017-02-27 19:17:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: not yet
[2017-02-27 19:17:52 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Just search "worst Twitch Rage" on YT and you'll find montages full of them
[2017-02-27 19:17:53 UTC] capstonegaming: yeah im waiting to see if machinima rules in his favor
[2017-02-27 19:17:54 UTC] thekingofsimpletonshd: hey d00ds
[2017-02-27 19:17:56 UTC] aglet57: That sucks

[2017-02-27 19:18:31 UTC] aglet57: loveseat. ooh la la. lol
[2017-02-27 19:18:33 UTC] sevenitysixty: whats a loveseat?
[2017-02-27 19:18:33 UTC] coffeemode: DSP, you do realise that an entire channel can be deemed advertiser unfriendly without youtube providing any email confirmation or flagging individual videos
[2017-02-27 19:18:34 UTC] soulrider95: @DarksydePhil, Horizon tonight?
[2017-02-27 19:18:45 UTC] vascolsn: this new stream time is messed up by 20 minutes wow

[2017-02-27 19:19:09 UTC] ginosaji48: Hardy boyz could be possibly going back to WWE sweet
[2017-02-27 19:19:14 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: unblock me on twitter philip
[2017-02-27 19:19:16 UTC] rosefox911: Lol, ok. My masters in CS from NEU makes me a "dumb person" but a person with a business degree from a joke school like Fairfield who can't balance his own checkbook is smart.
[2017-02-27 19:19:20 UTC] soulrider95: I don't use twitter LUL
[2017-02-27 19:19:21 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Yeah that would be nice Gino :)

[2017-02-27 19:19:47 UTC] darksydephil: book smart doesn't equate to actual human intelligence rosefox911 , that's obvious from your personal case lol
[2017-02-27 19:19:48 UTC] rosefox911: you don't know what CS is @theycallmejimbob ?
[2017-02-27 19:19:55 UTC] aglet57: Hardyz doing their broken thing in WWE could be either real weird or real good. I personally hate it
[2017-02-27 19:19:59 UTC] bammbino: @soulrider95, i answered it for you and you still kept asking

[2017-02-27 19:20:13 UTC] ashfordian2015: Is Paige still injured?
[2017-02-27 19:20:14 UTC] thekingofsimpletonshd: it's retarded now

[2017-02-27 19:21:00 UTC] coffeemode: DSP, your video makes the clear implication that the only time machinima has seen this drop in ad revenue is when a channel gets flagged
[2017-02-27 19:21:04 UTC] aglet57: ugh. WCPW is the worst

[2017-02-27 19:43:41 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Hello Eternia :)
[2017-02-27 19:43:42 UTC] betheboom: YAK(vomit)UZA

[2017-02-27 19:44:33 UTC] yacherdy: PogChamp
[2017-02-27 19:44:40 UTC] azuredragoongx1: And if Phil really wants a challenge in this game, he should fight the Bed of Styx bosses
[2017-02-27 19:44:47 UTC] azuredragoongx1: And the two secret bosses.... Hahahah
[2017-02-27 19:45:11 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: Phil and Rich from Reviewtechusa should sumo wrestle
[2017-02-27 19:45:11 UTC] vascolsn: no facecam??
[2017-02-27 19:45:25 UTC] akioartorius: I don't know how Phil will do playing a game like Ghost Trick or the new Phoenix Wright? Will it increase views?
[2017-02-27 19:45:25 UTC] masternutella: Why would he need facecam..?
[2017-02-27 19:45:26 UTC] shotinthedeep: That was just for nioh VascoLSN

[2017-02-27 19:46:14 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: 1 cheese pizza away Kappa
[2017-02-27 19:46:16 UTC] diobrand00: Still waiting for the day when he does a 24 hour stream
[2017-02-27 19:46:16 UTC] azuredragoongx1: I don't think so Phoenix
[2017-02-27 19:46:19 UTC] diobrand00: it will be funny as fuck
[2017-02-27 19:46:22 UTC] beanheadsonfire: He spent 45 minutes rambling on
[2017-02-27 19:46:29 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I really need to see him beat Sunshine
[2017-02-27 19:46:34 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Didn't a 24 hr streamer die recently?

[2017-02-27 19:46:56 UTC] shotinthedeep: damn
[2017-02-27 19:46:58 UTC] yacherdy: cocaine
[2017-02-27 19:47:01 UTC] betheboom: im not a broom
[2017-02-27 19:47:03 UTC] bammbino: @diobrand00, if people gave feedback w/o attacking him, maybe his pre-streams, WIP, and more will be shortened.. they actually delay his gameplay which causes games like these to last long and force a loss of interest
[2017-02-27 19:47:13 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: If Phil did a 24 hours stream there would be 8 hours of bathroom breaks
[2017-02-27 19:47:19 UTC] masternutella: ^
[2017-02-27 19:47:30 UTC] tigerflamessssss: i want to see SFV
[2017-02-27 19:47:33 UTC] diobrand00: 8 hours of jacking breaks more like it
[2017-02-27 19:47:33 UTC] azuredragoongx1: True, only four or so exclusive heat actions. But the amount of heat you get from the Rush style is great Phil
[2017-02-27 19:47:49 UTC] shotinthedeep: Nah it's more like BOOOOOM...a wild bethe appears
[2017-02-27 19:47:51 UTC] maluquification: I missed the beginning of the stream. Did something of importance happen?
[2017-02-27 19:47:55 UTC] beanheadsonfire: Nope
[2017-02-27 19:47:56 UTC] yacherdy: no
[2017-02-27 19:47:56 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Just a fight
[2017-02-27 19:48:01 UTC] betheboom: ya know it deep
[2017-02-27 19:48:04 UTC] vascolsn: 6 people got banned though
[2017-02-27 19:48:21 UTC] diobrand00: well its not like anyone cares about yakuza 0 LOL
[2017-02-27 19:48:22 UTC] yacherdy: Anyone remember Pokemon Snap?
[2017-02-27 19:48:23 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I actually started playing this due to this stream

[2017-02-27 19:49:42 UTC] yacherdy: I haven't played a Pokemon game since Pokemon Stadium 2
[2017-02-27 19:49:42 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Is this EASY?
[2017-02-27 19:49:45 UTC] blue_blur64: Well that's a lie @diobrand00
[2017-02-27 19:49:45 UTC] betheboom: i remember getting stuck in pokemon snap until i randomly found a shortcut to progress to the next level :D
[2017-02-27 19:49:54 UTC] shotinthedeep: lol bethe

[2017-02-27 19:50:03 UTC] sl0ps: Figured I'd give Phil a viewer, it's something. Plus I like him playing older vidya.
[2017-02-27 19:50:05 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I think I overplayed the game
[2017-02-27 19:50:10 UTC] diobrand00: i remember playing pokemon Colosseum on gamecube that game was pretty legit
[2017-02-27 19:50:18 UTC] sl0ps: this just reminds me of older vidya i mean

[2017-02-27 19:50:31 UTC] diobrand00: Gen 3 too much water
[2017-02-27 19:50:32 UTC] shotinthedeep: All these easy random enemies is just a bunch of padding
[2017-02-27 19:50:35 UTC] sl0ps: PT?
[2017-02-27 19:50:36 UTC] yacherdy: Unfortunately I didn't play much of GameCube....mostly just PS2

[2017-02-27 19:50:51 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I played as Goro is chapter 4 and already have the encounter finder, and like 30 percent of the minigamesdown
[2017-02-27 19:50:53 UTC] masternutella: Dude hes been done with street fighter
[2017-02-27 19:50:57 UTC] masternutella: He hates it
[2017-02-27 19:50:57 UTC] azuredragoongx1: There is an ability that lets you distract these guys
[2017-02-27 19:50:58 UTC] diobrand00: Gen 4 too many evolutions Gen 5 just sucked Gen 6 and 7 are bland
[2017-02-27 19:51:00 UTC] diobrand00: there you go
[2017-02-27 19:51:07 UTC] sl0ps: Hah, I'm thinking it would be Jak 2
[2017-02-27 19:51:12 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I just want enough points for when I get the last styles
[2017-02-27 19:51:12 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Phil, the Bed of Styx can be really hard
[2017-02-27 19:51:18 UTC] betheboom: PHIL DO THAT CAHMAN
[2017-02-27 19:51:29 UTC] sl0ps: Any Naughty Dog platformer

[2017-02-27 19:51:38 UTC] diobrand00: Well pokemon is atleast better than Digimon that whole franchise is a L
[2017-02-27 19:51:52 UTC] beanheadsonfire: How do I buy bits?
[2017-02-27 19:51:55 UTC] yacherdy: I was a Crash 2 expert at 6 years old Kappa
[2017-02-27 19:51:57 UTC] bammbino: i love my copy of pokemon moon, its a step in the direction of my long term dream of their being an open world 3d pokemon game on a real gaming system
[2017-02-27 19:52:01 UTC] phoenixrising2015: "I'm a beginner go easy on me" Old man: Ok. *Laughs as he beats you in a game you have no clue how to play*
[2017-02-27 19:52:04 UTC] betheboom: yacherdy and now?
[2017-02-27 19:52:05 UTC] sl0ps: @beanheadsonfire Bash your head into Amazon's gut
[2017-02-27 19:52:10 UTC] shotinthedeep: Does anyone play digimon anymore?
[2017-02-27 19:52:14 UTC] howlingwolfjoey: call me an eleist, but i think Sun and moon is not pokemon anymore.
[2017-02-27 19:52:17 UTC] masternutella: why is pokemon so fun...it's the same shit
[2017-02-27 19:52:17 UTC] blue_blur64: Plenty of people do

[2017-02-27 19:52:38 UTC] sl0ps: @MasterNutella Dat overworld has always been the biggest draw for me growing up.
[2017-02-27 19:52:49 UTC] sl0ps: But I guess it's a simple formula to remix
[2017-02-27 19:52:52 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Seriously, now that I'm playing as Kiryu again I can do what I saw to cheese the Shogi stuff
[2017-02-27 19:52:55 UTC] bammbino: @MasterNutella, atleast imo... its the progression system
[2017-02-27 19:53:02 UTC] sl0ps: When it stops selling, add a new feature, rinse repeat.
[2017-02-27 19:53:08 UTC] blue_blur64: Although Guilmon's English VA freaks me out lol
[2017-02-27 19:53:09 UTC] diobrand00: Shogi is a shitty game
[2017-02-27 19:53:10 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I don't think I'm ever beating the old Sega games Compleations
[2017-02-27 19:53:16 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Pulled out a bat! xD
[2017-02-27 19:53:18 UTC] diobrand00: only thing that competes with it is Go
[2017-02-27 19:53:18 UTC] sl0ps: Sega games were broken by design
[2017-02-27 19:53:20 UTC] yacherdy: NEGAN

[2017-02-27 19:53:40 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Seriously, the score they want for the points is ridiculous
[2017-02-27 19:53:50 UTC] howlingwolfjoey: and i think Ruby and saphire are the worst pokemon games imo.
[2017-02-27 19:53:51 UTC] diobrand00: where is Phill???

[2017-02-27 19:54:26 UTC] sl0ps: Flashcarts are great for betas
[2017-02-27 19:54:26 UTC] yacherdy: bethe the UK is upset because there's a shirt with Negan coming out "catch a tiger by its toe"...tiger is a derogatory term for a certain other term...so I think they're banning it.
[2017-02-27 19:54:29 UTC] shotinthedeep: Isn't it late to be having lunch gino?
[2017-02-27 19:54:32 UTC] shotinthedeep: in czech

[2017-02-27 19:54:57 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: if gta was just beating up random thugs all the time
[2017-02-27 19:55:04 UTC] podusmonens: wow gino makes a little mistake and everyone jumps on him
[2017-02-27 19:55:12 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Space Harrier I might be able to do, but the Outrun game I can't freaking do
[2017-02-27 19:55:19 UTC] bammbino: Falchions in a japanese mobster game???

[2017-02-27 20:36:36 UTC] euffy: Telling someone to kys is ban worthy in my opinion too, even if it's said as a joke. So do send them over.
[2017-02-27 20:36:36 UTC] bammbino: @eternia_forever, halo wars is having performance issues on high end pcs.. cant image a laptop

[2017-02-27 20:38:01 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I think they care just as much as the police do when your thrown out of a bar and you complain to them
[2017-02-27 20:38:04 UTC] bammbino: @betheboom, whats the last 3 games you beat?
[2017-02-27 20:38:10 UTC] bobbi_ling: already got 2 games this month. soon mass effect then ill be done for the year :D

[2017-02-27 20:39:13 UTC] nipah_chan: "WOAHHHH"- DSP
[2017-02-27 20:39:20 UTC] euffy: @Bammbino I loved the demo myself, managed to clear the hard mode without any big issues. I was too afraid to try the one hit kill mode though.
[2017-02-27 20:39:26 UTC] podusmonens: only keanu reeves can say whoah
[2017-02-27 20:39:28 UTC] betheboom: ohhhh yeah assassins creed ezio trilogy all of those
[2017-02-27 20:39:32 UTC] bobbi_ling: beth do the knife only run you casul

[2017-02-27 20:40:01 UTC] podusmonens: bethe is spending dough on games with akid on the way
[2017-02-27 20:40:06 UTC] capstonegaming: if you did the research youd know but most ppl just throw money at acoollege then follow everybody on the beaten path
[2017-02-27 20:40:12 UTC] howlingwolfjoey: AC went shit at 3 and i dropped the series
[2017-02-27 20:40:19 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I liked Rogue
[2017-02-27 20:40:20 UTC] capstonegaming: no diea what their tax dollars are funding
[2017-02-27 20:40:27 UTC] mfd4419: Huh @capstonegaming

[2017-02-27 20:40:32 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I didn't like the templar outfit
[2017-02-27 20:40:33 UTC] euffy: @Bammbino I've seen that complaint a lot and I can totally understand where you come from with that. For me Nier is more about the "feel", the story and the world. I can live with sub-standard camera.
[2017-02-27 20:40:43 UTC] capstonegaming: mfdd are u in america?
[2017-02-27 20:40:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I instead bought the dark assassin outfit to be like the cover of the game

[2017-02-27 20:41:01 UTC] bobbi_ling: but phils not bragging
[2017-02-27 20:41:04 UTC] bammbino: @Euffy, can play FPS games, but something is really weird about quick changes from third person to top-down to sidescroll to thumb shooter
[2017-02-27 20:41:07 UTC] eternia_forever: btw anyone wanting to save lots cash join bestbuys gamers unlocked program and you will save 20% and all new game that you buy from them even new game bought on day 1 only cost 47.99 plus tax and they have real good rewards program to @shotinthedeep @Bammbino

[2017-02-27 20:41:35 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: the writers wrote her rich Kappa

[2017-02-27 20:41:52 UTC] radicaldreamer1: PogChamp
[2017-02-27 20:41:57 UTC] capstonegaming: how many chapters are there?
[2017-02-27 20:42:04 UTC] betheboom: one more chapter with Kiryu and then 2 more with majima and then the finale chapter
[2017-02-27 20:42:06 UTC] bobbi_ling: 17
[2017-02-27 20:42:07 UTC] 0megaj0ker: :D
[2017-02-27 20:42:08 UTC] euffy: @Bammbino In the original Nier, there were one or two text adventure parts with no graphics, just text and choices. Old-school stuff.
[2017-02-27 20:42:11 UTC] mfd4419: Sooo how long is chapter 14
[2017-02-27 20:42:11 UTC] podusmonens: VR games are shit
[2017-02-27 20:42:19 UTC] daddi_boi: no
[2017-02-27 20:42:34 UTC] capstonegaming: he used jewish slur against somebody that wasnt even jewish which proves when u back american conservatives in to a corner of hypcorisy theyll just start callin u names like cuck and whatnot
[2017-02-27 20:42:34 UTC] betheboom: i dont know how long the chapters are though
[2017-02-27 20:42:36 UTC] capstonegaming: no point

[2017-02-27 20:43:22 UTC] bammbino: this game and nioh make me wonder if from software will ever do 60fps..
[2017-02-27 20:43:30 UTC] shotinthedeep: i remember that gino :D
[2017-02-27 20:43:37 UTC] bobbi_ling: dark souls 2 is 60fps
[2017-02-27 20:43:48 UTC] bammbino: im talking ps4/ps5 titles

[2017-02-27 20:44:01 UTC] bobbi_ling: ps4 dark souls 2 is 60fps
[2017-02-27 20:44:01 UTC] darksydephil: of Nioh could do 60fps, so can From Software. its lazy game development at this point to not do it. Nioh was a MUCH better game for having it
[2017-02-27 20:44:12 UTC] radicaldreamer1: lol Try Again :P
[2017-02-27 20:44:22 UTC] eternia_forever: was dark soul 3 60 fps @Bobbi_Ling

[2017-02-27 20:44:29 UTC] capstonegaming: yeah well from is going back to armored core and possibly tenchu so its good they dabbled in Wrpg stuff
[2017-02-27 20:44:34 UTC] phoenixrising2015: What the? Even I'll say he made that
[2017-02-27 20:44:35 UTC] soulrider95: Yes it was eternia_forever, on PC Kappa
[2017-02-27 20:44:38 UTC] bammbino: DS3 was like 15 FPS LOL

[2017-02-27 20:49:55 UTC] playcool18: I would say 144Hz vs 60 Hz is a bigger difference than frames
[2017-02-27 20:49:57 UTC] 0megaj0ker: that be funny if the Trainer brought in Mr. Shakedown :D
[2017-02-27 20:49:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: easy peasy

[2017-02-27 20:52:08 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @Bammbino, Well, they've patched it to the point you can get billions of GMP and never have to worry about running out, and no joke, if you finish the game, and do Quiet's mission 11 times, she comes back with no story reason and you get her back
[2017-02-27 20:52:09 UTC] betheboom: fuck Ling

[2017-02-27 21:14:08 UTC] bammbino: nintendo wants us to bend over... cant wait til they're in dire straights and start listening to feedback
[2017-02-27 21:14:09 UTC] darksydephil: the pro controller is "sold out" by the early adopter idiots like every piece of new tech. give it a month for the actual waves of stock to hit shelves
