[2017-02-16 20:07:20 UTC] aglet57: Gino I heard it was too repetitive. I don't mind grinding, but I don't want to do the same mission over and over
[2017-02-16 20:07:30 UTC] roubador: Yeah, he apologizes now because he wants something from you @DarksydePhil
[2017-02-16 20:07:32 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: just publish any thdp, besides copyright issues

[2017-02-16 20:59:06 UTC] dspolecat: it only appeals to people that like to actually get good at games and are competetive.
[2017-02-16 20:59:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: cause there's female vikings in the game dragin :P
[2017-02-16 20:59:17 UTC] encelor: shield maidens

[2017-02-16 21:01:58 UTC] dspolecat: Then wait for them too. I mean. In my experience most people (and by most I mean 9/10) will move from the ledge if you show you're not going near it
