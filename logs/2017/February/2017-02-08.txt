[2017-02-08 00:25:16 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: see ya
[2017-02-08 00:25:26 UTC] manyperegrine81: bye bye
[2017-02-08 00:25:33 UTC] ornightz: 800 people and only 240 entered , this boggles the mind
[2017-02-08 00:25:48 UTC] wooooowwe: cheer30
[2017-02-08 00:26:01 UTC] darksydephil: not everyone watching has a ps4
[2017-02-08 00:26:13 UTC] darksydephil: in fact id bet a ton of people who watch gameplay vids/streams dont have the consoles themselves, thats why they watch
[2017-02-08 00:26:22 UTC] ornightz: True but I'm still boggled
[2017-02-08 00:26:27 UTC] darksydephil: plus this is ps4 exclusive, so xbox/pc owners are boned
[2017-02-08 00:26:34 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: oh
[2017-02-08 00:26:43 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: it wont come out on any other platform?
[2017-02-08 00:27:13 UTC] evildeadmrjohn: Most likely not.
[2017-02-08 00:27:15 UTC] wooooowwe: It's distributed by Sony so I doubt it
[2017-02-08 00:27:22 UTC] ornightz: maybe it'll come out for the switch later down the line
[2017-02-08 00:27:40 UTC] ornightz: I could see this being played on switch
[2017-02-08 00:27:41 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: IF it is distributed by sony wouldn't they loose money not porting it?
[2017-02-08 00:27:49 UTC] manyperegrine81: That's why I am sticking to watching online playthroughs for 2017. I'm broke and trying to save money in going back to school
[2017-02-08 00:27:58 UTC] manyperegrine81: no new video games
[2017-02-08 00:29:23 UTC] wooooowwe: They wouldnt losse money
[2017-02-08 00:29:40 UTC] wooooowwe: It can attrract more people to the console because it is an exclusive
[2017-02-08 00:30:17 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: you think they would buy it exlusively to play this game
[2017-02-08 00:30:19 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: ?
[2017-02-08 00:31:07 UTC] wooooowwe: maybe not just for this game, but to pair with others
[2017-02-08 00:31:56 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: They probably did the math. But I still think it is weird
[2017-02-08 02:58:54 UTC] slurmdrinker: Night stream dspHmm
[2017-02-08 02:59:30 UTC] akioartorius: congrats no hero
[2017-02-08 02:59:50 UTC] fensthespook: Just got done getting my butt beat in Annor Lando (Dark Souls)...ready to watch Phil get his beat in Nioh :P
[2017-02-08 03:01:22 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah I hope the difficulty increases a bit
[2017-02-08 03:01:46 UTC] fensthespook: I was only able to watch a little of the earlier stream, saw the death counter was only at 1
[2017-02-08 03:01:52 UTC] fensthespook: How many did he end up with?
[2017-02-08 03:01:54 UTC] slurmdrinker: I think it went to 3
[2017-02-08 03:01:57 UTC] fensthespook: lol
[2017-02-08 03:02:00 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: something like that yes
[2017-02-08 03:02:01 UTC] fensthespook: Hey man not too bad
[2017-02-08 03:02:09 UTC] fensthespook: Say what you will...he is actually not terrible at these kind of games
[2017-02-08 03:02:18 UTC] fensthespook: He's not GREAT, but he's not by any means the worst
[2017-02-08 03:02:38 UTC] akioartorius: next is the beta area so...the difficulty should be tougher since Phil never beat it
[2017-02-08 03:02:52 UTC] fensthespook: He always impresses me the way he can one or two shot bosses sometimes. In Dark Souls I had to take on some bosses 6-10 times before I beta them
[2017-02-08 03:03:07 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: me too
[2017-02-08 03:03:13 UTC] akioartorius: Fens, before or after the BKH?
[2017-02-08 03:03:15 UTC] fensthespook: I'm actually just now playing through Dark Souls
[2017-02-08 03:03:20 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: And I had a BK weapon
[2017-02-08 03:03:31 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I don't think it is that incredibly OP
[2017-02-08 03:03:37 UTC] fensthespook: @akioartorius good point
[2017-02-08 03:03:46 UTC] fensthespook: I am playing without any aid (or only when I get stuck)
[2017-02-08 03:03:51 UTC] fensthespook: At Annor Lando now
[2017-02-08 03:03:59 UTC] akioartorius: DS1 or 3?
[2017-02-08 03:04:02 UTC] fensthespook: 3
[2017-02-08 03:04:08 UTC] akioartorius: okay
[2017-02-08 03:04:14 UTC] fensthespook: I'm a cleric build, using a Divine Mace +5...so...certianly nothing crazy
[2017-02-08 03:04:14 UTC] darksydephil: hello all, fyi im here

[2017-02-08 03:07:57 UTC] akioartorius: does anyone know if Phil should switch guardian spirits?
[2017-02-08 03:08:07 UTC] dukesdearfreja: What spirit does he have?
[2017-02-08 03:08:13 UTC] akioartorius: the wind hawk
[2017-02-08 03:08:16 UTC] rbreezay: !spirit
[2017-02-08 03:08:16 UTC] silverliver: Like I asked earlier, with the current gameplay out, is this worth a First day/$60 buy?
[2017-02-08 03:08:25 UTC] rbreezay: No
[2017-02-08 03:08:28 UTC] fensthespook: HIs Spirit animal is more of a naked mole rat :P
[2017-02-08 03:08:31 UTC] totallynotaviewbot1992: but dood the game doesnt explain how to switch spirits
[2017-02-08 03:08:38 UTC] dukesdearfreja: Oh that was the least popular choice, the hawk anyway... I don't think it's too good
[2017-02-08 03:08:44 UTC] akioartorius: you can at the shrine
[2017-02-08 03:08:52 UTC] fensthespook: Lmao these fan arts...

[2017-02-08 03:09:20 UTC] fensthespook: The cartoon ones are pretty good I was LOLing at the photoshop ones
[2017-02-08 03:09:32 UTC] darksydephil: the hawk seemed fine to me?
[2017-02-08 03:09:37 UTC] darksydephil: it made me faster at least
[2017-02-08 03:09:42 UTC] darksydephil: and the abilities were fine in combat
[2017-02-08 03:09:46 UTC] fensthespook: @DarksydePhil Mobility is a + that's for usre
[2017-02-08 03:09:50 UTC] darksydephil: so far faster seems better

[2017-02-08 03:10:04 UTC] darksydephil: id much rather be able to dodge something than do slightly more damage when it means im going to die in 1-2 hits lol
[2017-02-08 03:10:08 UTC] akioartorius: I meant elementally I wonder if some enemies are resistant to wind
[2017-02-08 03:10:13 UTC] dukesdearfreja: @darksydephil that's good if it works for you! Most people opted for the wolf spirit (weapon buff)
[2017-02-08 03:10:14 UTC] fensthespook: That's good sense talking right there
[2017-02-08 03:10:25 UTC] darksydephil: well we'll see right now

[2017-02-08 04:23:54 UTC] limiel: to be fair haptic, you can only hold up to 13 and 5 arrows
[2017-02-08 04:23:55 UTC] bammbino: @Limiel, so this is still fan service, but bits and subs keep him motivated to stream so we can chat w/ each other
[2017-02-08 04:24:16 UTC] encelor: @shotinthedeep he is wearing underleveld gear
[2017-02-08 04:24:18 UTC] fensthespook: We like watching him fail too, that's part of the fun
[2017-02-08 04:24:18 UTC] psychictaco115: This game needs the Skyrim mod where when you fire an arrow, it makes a pew noise

[2017-02-08 04:30:40 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Bammbino It wouldn't make any sense for them to pass on PC tho; it's not direct competition for Sony.
[2017-02-08 04:30:47 UTC] yacherdy: MATAMATA
[2017-02-08 04:30:59 UTC] hapticbabyman: They could put it on Steam, bypass Microsoft

[2017-02-08 04:34:34 UTC] yacherdy: would be*
[2017-02-08 04:34:45 UTC] bammbino: @FensTheSpook, look at how he is playing, hes constantly using the spear early to abuse the range
[2017-02-08 04:34:45 UTC] popsicolo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjwvQM4CmEI
[2017-02-08 04:34:49 UTC] fensthespook: I think playing through DS 1,2 and 3 has hardened him
[2017-02-08 04:35:04 UTC] fensthespook: @Bammbino Its part of the game mechanics tho
[2017-02-08 04:35:04 UTC] shotinthedeep: That's how you are supposed to play with a spear though
[2017-02-08 04:35:08 UTC] fensthespook: He's not exploiting anything

[2017-02-08 04:36:15 UTC] yacherdy: This game is ez
[2017-02-08 04:36:21 UTC] dkmariolink: The boss with a spear is going to be near impossible, he should use the dual katanas.
[2017-02-08 04:36:27 UTC] snowstormx30: haptic but saying that he is over leveled so should be in treating I predict 4 deaths to bat girl
[2017-02-08 04:36:31 UTC] akioartorius: spoilers
[2017-02-08 04:36:33 UTC] yacherdy: I just beat it...ez pz
[2017-02-08 04:36:35 UTC] fensthespook: He should use the noodle bowl

[2017-02-08 04:36:41 UTC] neonbornspartan9: i wasn't looking lol i don't get how he keeps dying, this game looks ez compared to DS.
[2017-02-08 04:36:42 UTC] yacherdy: only 35 deaths
[2017-02-08 04:36:46 UTC] hapticbabyman: @FensTheSpook : No they don't, but the bosses should be another thing altogether
[2017-02-08 04:36:49 UTC] ziibrah: is he close to a boss fight?
[2017-02-08 04:36:50 UTC] doctorzzz: LOL ninja turtle

[2017-02-08 04:36:58 UTC] encelor: its like the twinkling titanite creature
[2017-02-08 04:37:08 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, in the demos alot of us died alot ...as soon as we got in game, so i am sure they took that feedback to ease people in
[2017-02-08 04:37:13 UTC] bighayden50: i wonder if this game is going to turn in2 a franchise
[2017-02-08 04:37:19 UTC] akioartorius: treasure goblin
[2017-02-08 04:37:24 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Snowstormx30 : Depending on how late in the game that fight is, only 4 deaths would be disappointing. I like seeing deaths in general
[2017-02-08 04:37:27 UTC] snowstormx30: View almost 40 if you count side bosses
[2017-02-08 04:37:28 UTC] fensthespook: Praise the Sun
[2017-02-08 04:37:30 UTC] yacherdy: Nioh 3 and Niohborne

[2017-02-08 04:37:52 UTC] fensthespook: but I thin its a kodama
[2017-02-08 04:37:53 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, i know people are stuck in nostalgia land w/ team ninja, but you gotta realize that you need accessiblity in games for them to sell
[2017-02-08 04:37:57 UTC] encelor: no the running one
[2017-02-08 04:37:58 UTC] fensthespook: Look like baby kappas to me
[2017-02-08 04:38:00 UTC] easton_taylor1: What so important about that green creature?
[2017-02-08 04:38:04 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Bammbino So they really did ease up on the difficulty because of that feedback? Slightly disappointing
[2017-02-08 04:38:08 UTC] serakh_tsekani: MiniK
[2017-02-08 04:38:14 UTC] akioartorius: the treasure thing?
[2017-02-08 04:38:26 UTC] randomron005: Something tells me Phil's going to die a lot to the next boss.
[2017-02-08 04:38:26 UTC] yacherdy: Nostalgia gets in the way of clear thinking
[2017-02-08 04:38:30 UTC] yacherdy: with most people
[2017-02-08 04:38:32 UTC] snowstormx30: Haptic he was right by the boss door I suspect he has Google it
[2017-02-08 04:38:34 UTC] 0megaj0ker: has he used the dual-blades yet? I forgot.
[2017-02-08 04:38:37 UTC] fensthespook: lol
[2017-02-08 04:38:41 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, they took all kinds of feedback and thats why the game is gettings 9s
[2017-02-08 04:38:41 UTC] fensthespook: Got your dome split
[2017-02-08 04:38:42 UTC] yacherdy: can't accept the present or the future
[2017-02-08 04:38:44 UTC] encelor: phil climb ladder and snipe it
[2017-02-08 04:38:55 UTC] akioartorius: Phil use the dual katanas for combobility
[2017-02-08 04:38:57 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Bammbino I understand that part of it, but still, there were other ways they could've made it accessible. I hate modern gaming sometimes xD
[2017-02-08 04:38:59 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, the difficulty does ramp up and the main ticket to the show is TWILIGHT modes
[2017-02-08 04:39:04 UTC] bighayden50: get him video game thing get him lol
[2017-02-08 04:39:07 UTC] fensthespook: What's in the rock??

[2017-02-08 04:40:18 UTC] snowstormx30: Haptic I would say yh it's slightly easier then spike up in difficulty after bat girl
[2017-02-08 04:40:22 UTC] shotinthedeep: cant call it a mini boss if it's a normal enemy now

[2017-02-08 05:14:35 UTC] dkmariolink: Pause to see mission objective, and follow your minimap @Darksydephil
[2017-02-08 05:14:43 UTC] bammbino: @Snowstormx30, 850 people were in chat and so many spammed it in chat
[2017-02-08 05:14:52 UTC] 0megaj0ker: they are having a nice party :D
[2017-02-08 05:14:54 UTC] akioartorius: Did phil change his spriit?

[2017-02-08 05:15:14 UTC] encelor: its nice that spare elixers go to your shrine
[2017-02-08 05:15:28 UTC] bammbino: @Snowstormx30, in a way yes, but he has to go buy what his audience wants to see and doesnt
[2017-02-08 05:15:47 UTC] bammbino: by*

[2017-02-08 05:17:03 UTC] snowstormx30: Bammbhino surely they want to see the mission level and details instead of a grey hole lol. Although when he gets Kodama sense it's kinda usefull
[2017-02-08 05:17:04 UTC] bammbino: @iconicmaster1, weapon choices, builds, abd item luck are a big factor
[2017-02-08 05:17:10 UTC] akioartorius: Hino-enma will now appear kappa

[2017-02-08 05:19:32 UTC] urgedcrusher: Anyone watched drifters?
[2017-02-08 05:19:48 UTC] snowstormx30: Bammbhino I will try not to mention it from now on lol. Why would anyone want to see him fail it's only a game. I like seeing a challenge but ultimately I like seeing people conquer that challenge.
[2017-02-08 05:19:54 UTC] iconicmaster1: Extended late night stream
[2017-02-08 05:19:55 UTC] ziibrah: I wish every season pass was as good as witcher 3

[2017-02-08 19:55:30 UTC] elipsion: Its probably not being promoted in related videos by youtubee
[2017-02-08 19:55:49 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: have patience phil.
[2017-02-08 19:55:52 UTC] deltaforce355: maybe more exposure, darksydephil?

[2017-02-08 19:56:12 UTC] darksydephil: RE7 review has 9400 views, thats good
[2017-02-08 19:56:20 UTC] shotinthedeep: Oh. For some reason YouTube notifications aren't working so well
[2017-02-08 19:56:21 UTC] darksydephil: twitch and chill montage has 6.2k views, thats OK
[2017-02-08 19:56:24 UTC] podusmonens: hey jimmy
[2017-02-08 19:56:25 UTC] nothingnoone: mb its game specific
[2017-02-08 19:56:37 UTC] darksydephil: then my RE7 PSVR video has only 4.4k views after being up almost a week?
[2017-02-08 19:56:39 UTC] shotinthedeep: I've watched all except the injustice impressions
[2017-02-08 19:56:50 UTC] darksydephil: the dark souls montage finally topped 5k views today, thats good considering its the first in the series
[2017-02-08 19:56:50 UTC] shotinthedeep: Just saw that was up
[2017-02-08 19:56:56 UTC] podusmonens: no one cares about VR I guess
[2017-02-08 19:57:00 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Things don't just happen over night. Detication and a bit of patience I think would turn the ship around
[2017-02-08 19:57:03 UTC] podusmonens: I've definitely lost interest
[2017-02-08 19:57:10 UTC] darksydephil: but my injustice 2 beta thoughts has been out for 2 days and doens't even have 3k views?!? for a channel with over 20k subs, i have no idea wtf is going on
[2017-02-08 19:57:19 UTC] nothingnoone: mb its weather specific, people buy firewood and turn off the internet
[2017-02-08 19:57:27 UTC] elipsion: Maybe people dont care about injustice too much
[2017-02-08 19:57:27 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: 1 video per game is best yield imo
[2017-02-08 19:57:36 UTC] bethe2670: i dont care for vr either
[2017-02-08 19:57:37 UTC] deltaforce355: maybe you need more exposure darksydephil?
[2017-02-08 19:57:37 UTC] shotinthedeep: KOgaming seems to get more views over time
[2017-02-08 19:57:40 UTC] deltaforce355: dont know
[2017-02-08 19:57:41 UTC] podusmonens: people are still playing the beta, maybe?
[2017-02-08 19:57:50 UTC] podusmonens: they go for opinions when it ends. or maybe it ended
[2017-02-08 19:57:53 UTC] ginosaji48: /me slaps bethe
[2017-02-08 19:57:59 UTC] darksydephil: i dunno. its just that im putting lots of time/effort into these vids and i can't even get 3k views on them, thats definitely not worth it
[2017-02-08 19:58:00 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: keep up the good work and see how it's doing in a few months. Things might vary from day to day
[2017-02-08 19:58:06 UTC] darksydephil: i could have played yakuza 0 and gotten more out of it lol
[2017-02-08 19:58:26 UTC] podusmonens: give it time

[2017-02-08 19:59:00 UTC] darksydephil: and subs have completely stagnated on the channel, they're not going up at all despite all the new content
[2017-02-08 19:59:06 UTC] podusmonens: your impressions videos are well informed in my opinion. and fairly objective

[2017-02-08 21:06:17 UTC] stillbus: I honestly think spicy food is pure garbage, you get nothing from it apart from pain and in the end you are most likely feeding yourself shit so please do everyone a favour and save you're throats, they are vulnerable and even affect your voice. One example is Phil Burnell. As you can see his *** will remain forever in the minds of others because he cant eat proper food. Ban spicy food because its nasty, more nasty than any looking at shit

[2017-02-08 21:07:18 UTC] shotinthedeep: It's sad that people don't enjoy spices. What's there to enjoy in life?

[2017-02-08 21:20:19 UTC] stillbus: @bethe2670 is truly hocus pocus, he doesnt deserve mod not even that crown because he is one untrustworthy individual that spoils experiences and annoys everyone, hes no where near YaCherdys level of intelligence, in fact hes just way out of his league. Boo hoo @bethe2670 you aint getting mod bro
[2017-02-08 21:20:19 UTC] yacherdy: Once I'm mod, all current mods will be fired and I will also get rid of Phil.

[2017-02-08 21:23:33 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: haha

[2017-02-08 21:25:06 UTC] 0megaj0ker: PJSalt
[2017-02-08 21:25:11 UTC] kingjadvcmp: bethe is certainly a dedicated viewer, knows a lot of the chat it would appear, is also a sub - if they wanna help, surely it's in Phil's best interests?

[2017-02-08 21:27:14 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah, shame it only is a PS4 exclusiver
[2017-02-08 21:27:18 UTC] tenpiece32: no one is talking about the game that shows you something
[2017-02-08 21:27:31 UTC] bethe2670: vidar i got it :D
[2017-02-08 21:27:37 UTC] kingjadvcmp: as I said I am not long in the stream, so haven't really had enough time to have a solid opinion yet on the stream - it would be poor to form an opinion too soon
[2017-02-08 21:27:41 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: disappoining game maybe
[2017-02-08 21:27:42 UTC] deltaforce355: NIOH looks easy so far
[2017-02-08 21:27:49 UTC] stillbus: nobody is talking about @bethe2670 talents because he has none
[2017-02-08 21:27:51 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Yea but you ahve a PS4 TO play it NIOH on as well
[2017-02-08 21:27:52 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: :D
[2017-02-08 21:27:52 UTC] 12345tyeu: very disspaointed
[2017-02-08 21:27:59 UTC] deltaforce355: is it cuz the game got nerfed or phil is that good?
[2017-02-08 21:27:59 UTC] fensthespook: Where my Dark Souls people at...i got a ?
[2017-02-08 21:28:05 UTC] shotinthedeep: I'm thinking about getting nioh. It looks pretty cool

[2017-02-08 21:28:07 UTC] 12345tyeu: nerfed
[2017-02-08 21:28:15 UTC] kingjadvcmp: this is not a game I'd be interested in playing, personally - not my kinda game
[2017-02-08 21:28:15 UTC] mc_burnout26: it might of been a different mission
[2017-02-08 21:28:21 UTC] mc_burnout26: might not be the same one ?
[2017-02-08 21:28:25 UTC] mfd4419: @mr_vidar_viking it won't be for long if it keeps getting attractive to the main
[2017-02-08 21:28:28 UTC] yacherdy: As mod, it would be my duty to get Phil and the detractors to make up.
[2017-02-08 21:28:29 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: you don't like the souls game kingjad?
[2017-02-08 21:28:38 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: let us hope so mfd
[2017-02-08 21:28:46 UTC] lvlpower: I sub for to see phil to play Nioh now it's easy wtf
[2017-02-08 21:28:51 UTC] god_revan_ryu: Wow...those Mini Cyclops are fucking chumps now
[2017-02-08 21:28:53 UTC] bethe2670: i hate the souls games and bloodborne but this game isnt sould or bloodborne
[2017-02-08 21:28:59 UTC] kingjadvcmp: never saw the appeal, personally. Mind you, I've never actually went out and played it, I just don't think it would appeal to me.
[2017-02-08 21:29:00 UTC] stuart360: I actually thought Phil would rage quite this game, judging from the Alpha. In reality he will be doing badly to get 50 deaths in this game. What a letdown lol
[2017-02-08 21:29:03 UTC] tubby___: phil is still wearing the pre order DLC, thats how broken it is
[2017-02-08 21:29:06 UTC] bethe2670: and this game is much more enjoyable
[2017-02-08 21:29:11 UTC] 12345tyeu: damn pohil saying its easy

[2017-02-08 21:29:30 UTC] yacherdy: I thought you hated this kind of game?
[2017-02-08 21:29:32 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: IT hopefully stil has the potential to get harder
[2017-02-08 21:29:34 UTC] deltaforce355: looks like a mix of dynasty warriors and dark souls to me bethe
[2017-02-08 21:29:36 UTC] mfd4419: It is fun to play but the main drawback would be the difficult
[2017-02-08 21:29:39 UTC] stillbus: To anyone saying Nioh is easy please suck a fat juicy hairy slimy stinky scratchy pimply nerdy small huge dick pls apart from @yacherdy he is the one that provides it

[2017-02-08 21:29:56 UTC] mynameismrrobot: @kingjadvcmp It may look boring to watch but playing it is different
[2017-02-08 21:29:57 UTC] veronix_x: Do you mods get paid? :D
[2017-02-08 21:30:01 UTC] 12345tyeu: troll more stillbuss
[2017-02-08 21:30:06 UTC] bethe2670: i do yacherdy but this game seems fun
[2017-02-08 21:30:08 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Not the final boss fens
[2017-02-08 21:30:10 UTC] ginosaji48: maybe just laid Veroni
[2017-02-08 21:30:10 UTC] mynameismrrobot: I don't know that's how I was for a while

[2017-02-08 21:30:26 UTC] veronix_x: what? :D
[2017-02-08 21:30:28 UTC] kingjadvcmp: good point - I think going by the chat in general, from my observations, it's not a game that is appealing to watch others play (unless they're an expert at it, doing a crazy run of sorts)
[2017-02-08 21:30:29 UTC] bethe2670: no mods get paied
[2017-02-08 21:30:33 UTC] lvlpower: :(

[2017-02-08 21:37:49 UTC] marpat1993: they probably upscaled the game towards the middle
[2017-02-08 21:37:52 UTC] bethe2670: hello pepsicola

[2017-02-08 21:51:20 UTC] knightmare_29: @frampt01 oh. They might have been similar cuz the OST of the game has a certain style or they could have been the same. Idk cuz i havent played it yet
[2017-02-08 21:51:21 UTC] bethe2670: and he died 4 more times on todays stream so far
[2017-02-08 21:51:30 UTC] beesnipe1: Oh the red glowing thing is a weak point phil? fuck

[2017-02-08 21:52:16 UTC] stuart360: Its obvious the review copys were the same hard difficulty as the alpha, but Tecmo had a last minute change of heart and nerfed the retail release.
[2017-02-08 21:52:18 UTC] mfd4419: I will jus sick to bloodborne then
[2017-02-08 21:52:25 UTC] stillbus: the hardest game is the entire nes collection VoteYea

[2017-02-08 21:53:25 UTC] yacherdy: doesn't phil look like grumpy cat?

[2017-02-08 21:54:49 UTC] tubby___: this boss is literally less exciting than the first DS boss
[2017-02-08 21:54:51 UTC] akioartorius: lightning has aoe
[2017-02-08 21:54:52 UTC] kinggoken: why are people saying this game is boring?
[2017-02-08 21:54:54 UTC] stuart360: Yeah if a mod timed me out because they thought i was a trol, i'm not. I was a regular on Youtube streams, Gino should know my username
[2017-02-08 21:54:56 UTC] silverliver: he didn't move in time to avoid the lightning. that wasn't cheap at all
[2017-02-08 21:55:03 UTC] kinggoken: look at the graphics! The sound! The gameplay! This is good stuff.

[2017-02-08 21:55:38 UTC] slurmdrinker: The game is fair now not easy :)
[2017-02-08 21:55:39 UTC] knightmare_29: @folkestoneboy this is a dark souls like game. Bloodborne is faster too and it's not a hack n slash. Nioh may be even faster, but it has even more strategy tbh
[2017-02-08 21:55:40 UTC] bethe2670: at least she can dance NotLikeThis

[2017-02-08 21:57:34 UTC] kinggoken: injustice 2 beta? can't wait to try it out!
[2017-02-08 21:57:35 UTC] kg12228: @mr_vidar_viking that better be a troll comment. modes are just graphics and framerate

[2017-02-08 21:58:46 UTC] viewtifuljen: @knightmare_29 nue is not much of a challenge with the spear. just run and poke.
[2017-02-08 21:58:53 UTC] kg12228: @mr_vidar_viking it's just graphics. movie mode is 30fps better textures. variable is in the middle. action is the least quality but 60fps always
[2017-02-08 21:58:58 UTC] folkestoneboy: Is Phil still getting the switch?
[2017-02-08 21:59:06 UTC] kinggoken: yes
[2017-02-08 21:59:10 UTC] thekingofsimpletonshd: yes

[2017-02-08 21:59:28 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: it's a business asset
[2017-02-08 21:59:31 UTC] yacherdy: plus two games tho
[2017-02-08 21:59:31 UTC] jiyuna_seishin: is thiz like dark souls
[2017-02-08 21:59:32 UTC] snowstormx30: Just heard the switch won't even have a Web browser wtf lol
[2017-02-08 21:59:32 UTC] bethe2670: MOAR for main mission 3
[2017-02-08 21:59:33 UTC] knightmare_29: @viewtifuljen i havent played the game, but from what im seeing the difficulty was just nerfed. I dont think a different weapon type would make the boss that much harder
[2017-02-08 21:59:34 UTC] folkestoneboy: Is he going to play breath of the wild?
[2017-02-08 21:59:35 UTC] viewtifuljen: He preordered it

[2017-02-08 21:59:56 UTC] bethe2670: he is getting zelda and the switch
[2017-02-08 21:59:59 UTC] solidussnakex: Switch is another pointless gimmick
[2017-02-08 22:00:06 UTC] kinggoken: switch is going to blow people away
[2017-02-08 22:00:09 UTC] yacherdy: I would recommend skipping the switch and saving up for a PC
[2017-02-08 22:00:10 UTC] kinggoken: i bet it sales more than the Wii U
[2017-02-08 22:00:11 UTC] kg12228: @mr_vidar_viking nope Phil is just succeeding

[2017-02-08 22:00:56 UTC] stuart360: Why are people so excited over the Switch?. Yet another underpowered Nintendo console that will probably average 1 game a month over its life span.

[2017-02-08 22:01:37 UTC] ziibrah: stuart360, it will flop for sure, but Nintendo are all about the hype nowadays so it will sell no matter what
[2017-02-08 22:01:38 UTC] yacherdy: street fighter 2 the revolutionary new fighting game

[2017-02-08 22:23:18 UTC] stuart360: Youtube is better by a country mile. Much better quality video, and the stream chat was a lot better. You seem to get timed out here for no reason
[2017-02-08 22:23:18 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: it should be possible to embedd youtube in the twitch player

[2017-02-08 22:24:51 UTC] marktactics: "marriage is for mentally unstabled" sounds like something a mentally unstabled would say
[2017-02-08 22:24:51 UTC] quinn800: he takes way to long of breaks

[2017-02-08 22:26:17 UTC] stuart360: Its not 4 hours if you take away pre-stream and break, its less than 3 hours actually
[2017-02-08 22:26:25 UTC] yacherdy: plunger fetish?
[2017-02-08 22:26:27 UTC] bethe2670: leicester won lol

[2017-02-08 22:27:32 UTC] shotinthedeep: must have had a nice wank
[2017-02-08 22:27:35 UTC] donniedarksouls: How was your fap phil?
[2017-02-08 22:27:37 UTC] popsicolo: I pour my bacon grease into a foil lined bowl and put it in the freezer.
[2017-02-08 22:27:50 UTC] yacherdy: shotinthedeep is a detractor
[2017-02-08 22:27:51 UTC] god_revan_ryu: Give away dude @DarksydePhil

[2017-02-08 22:28:22 UTC] neonbornspartan9: BibleThump BabyRage
[2017-02-08 22:28:22 UTC] stuart360: Because you did a 2nd stream last night, people in Europe can't watch that stream because its too late, meaning they are behind when THIS stream starts so its pointless watching this stream
[2017-02-08 22:28:22 UTC] akioartorius: cheer10 we are here for the stream at least

[2017-02-08 23:36:47 UTC] yacherdy: ^
[2017-02-08 23:36:48 UTC] ands_: There are enemies in the game that respond to gestures.
[2017-02-08 23:36:51 UTC] shotinthedeep: So the mods are sok then
[2017-02-08 23:36:52 UTC] hapticbabyman: I just remember people really freaking out w/ the Glenn death, even tho it was pretty much just like in the comic

[2017-02-08 23:36:59 UTC] manyperegrine81: I hate Phillip DeFranco so much. He is such a hypocrite and trying so hard not to be a Leftist.
[2017-02-08 23:37:03 UTC] shotinthedeep: That's why you guys say bethe can't be a mod

[2017-02-08 23:37:14 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @YaCherdy, The arc after that is going to need gore. Unless the violence decrease will make it more impactful when the gore kicks in

[2017-02-08 23:37:46 UTC] yacherdy: @Phoenixrising2015 I truly don';t think the violence will be toned down that much. Just less eye popage and guts spilled
[2017-02-08 23:37:50 UTC] bethe2670: see gino admits he is leader :D
[2017-02-08 23:38:01 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Ands_ The game not being nearly as challenging as the alpha

[2017-02-08 23:38:14 UTC] ands_: Oh lord. He's already played like 2/3's of the game before.
[2017-02-08 23:38:18 UTC] ands_: Of course it's not challenging.
[2017-02-08 23:38:19 UTC] spade137: the alpha could have been harder because it is shorter
[2017-02-08 23:38:22 UTC] deltaforce355: what are we going to do leader gino?
[2017-02-08 23:38:23 UTC] dweebenheimer20: They scaled back on the difficulty based on complaints
[2017-02-08 23:38:25 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob how can i when im not
[2017-02-08 23:38:27 UTC] elipsion: You are suppose to kill the Kappa demon to clear this mission
[2017-02-08 23:38:28 UTC] spade137: the alpha is just starting levels too
[2017-02-08 23:38:28 UTC] jagsbestfriend: so in comparrison, dark souls, bloodborne or nioh?
[2017-02-08 23:38:35 UTC] popsicolo: Yes.
[2017-02-08 23:38:35 UTC] ands_: No they didn't. They objectively did not tone anything down.
[2017-02-08 23:38:36 UTC] bethe2670: i mean gino does it but im not gino
[2017-02-08 23:38:37 UTC] dweebenheimer20: or feedback rather
[2017-02-08 23:38:47 UTC] mfd4419: @dweebenheimer20 from who tho
[2017-02-08 23:38:48 UTC] ands_: Horseshit.
[2017-02-08 23:38:49 UTC] bammbino: the guitar guys are so annoying
[2017-02-08 23:38:50 UTC] hapticbabyman: @dweebenheimer20 but not all of those complaints were legitimate
[2017-02-08 23:38:58 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Thats a big ass pick for such a small guitar
[2017-02-08 23:39:02 UTC] bradleymason1993: and people thought this game was better than dark souls Kappa
[2017-02-08 23:39:05 UTC] bethe2670: if i say shit people take it serious
[2017-02-08 23:39:07 UTC] ginosaji48: my job is to ruin phil, doing a mod is just a hobby
[2017-02-08 23:39:08 UTC] ands_: People saying they toned the game down are the same people who played ALL THREE of the demos.
[2017-02-08 23:39:09 UTC] dweebenheimer20: @hapticbabyman yeah im not arguing that, just stating what they said
[2017-02-08 23:39:13 UTC] bethe2670: with gino no one cares
[2017-02-08 23:39:14 UTC] hapticbabyman: some people just probably sucked ass in the alpha and ignored all the stuff there
[2017-02-08 23:39:19 UTC] ibedavey: have you played it Bradley?
[2017-02-08 23:39:26 UTC] popsicolo: That's how I deal with street musicians.
[2017-02-08 23:39:31 UTC] ibedavey: because NiOh looks way more fun than DS to me
[2017-02-08 23:39:32 UTC] bradleymason1993: IBeDavey, yeah lol
[2017-02-08 23:39:33 UTC] shotinthedeep: How is Gino still a mod?
[2017-02-08 23:39:36 UTC] ands_: I've played all three and nothing has changed.
[2017-02-08 23:39:37 UTC] somone192: haha gino, such a jokah dspSexy
[2017-02-08 23:39:38 UTC] akioartorius: it is called a shamisen not a guitar I think
[2017-02-08 23:39:46 UTC] yacherdy: Gino isn't joking
[2017-02-08 23:39:51 UTC] yacherdy: he told me last night
[2017-02-08 23:39:55 UTC] deltaforce355: you gain money phil's life HELL gino?
[2017-02-08 23:39:56 UTC] bethe2670: gino NEVER jokes
[2017-02-08 23:39:56 UTC] ginosaji48: phil likes me too much to ban me
[2017-02-08 23:39:57 UTC] marpat1993: noooooo
[2017-02-08 23:39:58 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Ands_ I'm just going off what I've seen of his playthrough so far; The same areas from the demo he did last two streams, the enemies were noticeably simpler
[2017-02-08 23:40:04 UTC] jagsbestfriend: this game has more to offer than dark souls right?
[2017-02-08 23:40:07 UTC] deltaforce355: you should have 1000000000$ by now
[2017-02-08 23:40:13 UTC] bammbino: Ands_, you're alone in your little world man.. EVERYONE is complaining that this game is too easy
[2017-02-08 23:40:17 UTC] marktactics: Yes I think its shamisen
[2017-02-08 23:40:23 UTC] ginosaji48: i get paid in soap
[2017-02-08 23:40:29 UTC] bethe2670: gino that is true he has said he wouldnt believe evil chat when they tried to FUCK you
[2017-02-08 23:40:29 UTC] hapticbabyman: They seemed to take a bit more damage and their tracking didn't seem as hawkish as in the demos
[2017-02-08 23:40:29 UTC] bammbino: lirik, cohh, peeve, oro, forums, reddit
[2017-02-08 23:40:37 UTC] bethe2670: lol ok gino
[2017-02-08 23:40:39 UTC] akioartorius: either a shamisen or a biwa
[2017-02-08 23:40:44 UTC] naddodr: Knew it Gino
[2017-02-08 23:40:44 UTC] yacherdy: gino is trying to get demodded
[2017-02-08 23:40:45 UTC] furrywulfz: the demo was set to a higher difficulty
[2017-02-08 23:40:46 UTC] yacherdy: Kappa
[2017-02-08 23:40:48 UTC] shotinthedeep: Supposedly, this game is considerably long and has actual cutscenes and story exposition
[2017-02-08 23:40:54 UTC] ands_: Haptic, again. He has already played all of this. Go back and watch his old playthrough. The enemies behave and have the same damage as before.
[2017-02-08 23:40:55 UTC] ands_: Period.
[2017-02-08 23:40:56 UTC] somone192: the game doesnt come to my house until valentines day :(
[2017-02-08 23:41:05 UTC] yacherdy: Phil is tilted
[2017-02-08 23:41:07 UTC] akioartorius: and it is a shamisen or biwa yokai playing the monk not the monk playing the instrument
[2017-02-08 23:41:09 UTC] dweebenheimer20: are the twilight missions easy too?
[2017-02-08 23:41:11 UTC] jagsbestfriend: 70 hours of gameplay to complete in total
[2017-02-08 23:41:16 UTC] furrywulfz: if you co-op (as in not helping people, playig with a friend you can select difficulties
[2017-02-08 23:41:17 UTC] yacherdy: hes starting to dislike the game EleGiggle
[2017-02-08 23:41:25 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, ignore ands, hes an idiot simple as that
[2017-02-08 23:41:36 UTC] 1buttondash: wait, same map?

[2017-02-08 23:41:49 UTC] furrywulfz: NG+ supposedly adds additional challenge to the game
[2017-02-08 23:41:50 UTC] mfd4419: Yea people were complaining that they had to replay the same maps over and over smash
[2017-02-08 23:41:53 UTC] deltaforce355: heh gino
[2017-02-08 23:41:54 UTC] marktactics: The game is longer than any DS. It gets harder later on
[2017-02-08 23:42:04 UTC] mfd4419: Smh
[2017-02-08 23:42:05 UTC] bethe2670: lol gino

[2017-02-08 23:42:31 UTC] mfd4419: Yea man disappointed in the game so far
[2017-02-08 23:42:32 UTC] popsicolo: That's what I said when my girlfriend broke up with the last guy she was dating, Gino.
[2017-02-08 23:42:33 UTC] theycallmejimbob: is he doing a second stream tonight?
[2017-02-08 23:42:35 UTC] yacherdy: Phil will give this a 7.75
[2017-02-08 23:42:38 UTC] theycallmejimbob: aww son of a bitch

[2017-02-08 23:42:52 UTC] mfd4419: Hope the game gets harder
[2017-02-08 23:42:54 UTC] stuart360: I don't know how anyone can deny that they nerfed this game. A ton of streamers are saying its been nerfed, even Phil has said it multiple times today.
[2017-02-08 23:42:55 UTC] akioartorius: This Phil is on fire!
[2017-02-08 23:43:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :D akio

[2017-02-08 23:43:22 UTC] jagsbestfriend: is phil on ps4 pro or regular ps4?
[2017-02-08 23:43:25 UTC] akioartorius: not a guitar player. it is a shamisen or biwa yokai controling a monk
[2017-02-08 23:43:26 UTC] bammbino: regular
[2017-02-08 23:43:29 UTC] mfd4419: Can't wait to still play it though
[2017-02-08 23:43:33 UTC] ands_: Haha. Nerfed. Enemies take same damage, deal same damage and have the same attack patterns. Nerfed!
[2017-02-08 23:43:34 UTC] ginosaji48: is it just me or did you guys see black background around the picture ?
[2017-02-08 23:43:36 UTC] hapticbabyman: Plus he's been doing pretty well in the new areas not in the demos too, so I'm of the mind they toned down the challenge from those demos
[2017-02-08 23:43:44 UTC] ands_: He's been in one new area.
[2017-02-08 23:43:50 UTC] bethe2670: just you gino :D
[2017-02-08 23:44:00 UTC] ginosaji48: really ?
[2017-02-08 23:44:13 UTC] ands_: Well 1.5 if you count the tombs.
[2017-02-08 23:44:14 UTC] naddodr: racist Gino confirmed
[2017-02-08 23:44:23 UTC] bammbino: @mfd4419, when you get it, dont use spear or kusa if you wanna add some difficulty
[2017-02-08 23:44:24 UTC] shotinthedeep: yeah just you Gino
[2017-02-08 23:44:27 UTC] doctorzzz: neh i too see small black lines left n right
[2017-02-08 23:44:31 UTC] shotinthedeep: It must be that czech internet

[2017-02-08 23:44:35 UTC] stuart360: Ands everyone must be brainwashed then and only you can see the truth
[2017-02-08 23:44:35 UTC] bammbino: @mfd4419, their range makes it a breeze
[2017-02-08 23:44:39 UTC] doctorzzz: its not scaled
[2017-02-08 23:44:46 UTC] somone192: just got here but, is this the twilight version since you guys are saying its the same map?
[2017-02-08 23:44:49 UTC] marktactics: Nerfed but still fun
[2017-02-08 23:44:58 UTC] shotinthedeep: they made it too casual
[2017-02-08 23:45:01 UTC] ginosaji48: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjG06g8jWfY
[2017-02-08 23:45:02 UTC] hapticbabyman: Yeah, one new area so far and it was about as easy for him as the other two
[2017-02-08 23:45:15 UTC] marktactics: Besides it's more linear than DS so it gets progressivly harder
[2017-02-08 23:45:17 UTC] mfd4419: Idk I'm just looking for soling to replace bloodborne for me
[2017-02-08 23:45:23 UTC] shotinthedeep: this should be easy mode
[2017-02-08 23:45:24 UTC] mfd4419: Something
[2017-02-08 23:45:29 UTC] popsicolo: Gino, are you sure about that?
[2017-02-08 23:45:32 UTC] shotinthedeep: but they don't have different difficulty modes
[2017-02-08 23:45:35 UTC] deltaforce355: DSP difficulty deep
[2017-02-08 23:45:44 UTC] hapticbabyman: but like I said, I could be mistaken; will have to see how the rest of the playthrough goes. got no problem being proven wrong here (in fact I WANT the game to be hard)
[2017-02-08 23:45:46 UTC] bammbino: @mfd4419, this game's combat beats both dark souls and bloodborne sadly
[2017-02-08 23:45:53 UTC] ginosaji48: :D
[2017-02-08 23:45:58 UTC] bammbino: @mfd4419, the camera and 60fps make such a difference

[2017-02-08 23:47:51 UTC] ands_: He knew exactly where to go both of the old levels, as well as the mechanics of the game.
[2017-02-08 23:47:58 UTC] stuart360: Ands_ did you work on this game or something?. The game has clearly been nerfed, tons of people are saying it.
[2017-02-08 23:48:02 UTC] ands_: @Bammbino I'm not sure you know what a detractor is.
[2017-02-08 23:48:13 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he's a detractor because he doesn't agree with you sound logic there
[2017-02-08 23:48:26 UTC] bammbino: you're bitching about him progressing this far over 1 freaking demo test lol
[2017-02-08 23:48:26 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: your not alone @bammbino
[2017-02-08 23:48:32 UTC] jagsbestfriend: does phil has his gaming audio going to his headphones?
[2017-02-08 23:48:36 UTC] bammbino: get a clue and get a grip
[2017-02-08 23:48:42 UTC] bethe2670: YAAAAAAAAAAY my sister made my fiance forgive me.... she knew i sent my sister in there lol it worked though
[2017-02-08 23:48:43 UTC] ands_: @stuart360 Go back and watch his previous playthrough or others and compare it to the behavior of the enemies in the full game and tell me that.
[2017-02-08 23:48:46 UTC] akioartorius: yes about the audio
[2017-02-08 23:48:47 UTC] yacherdy: chat is very tense right
[2017-02-08 23:48:49 UTC] shotinthedeep: yep Jagsbestfriend
[2017-02-08 23:48:49 UTC] yacherdy: peace and love
[2017-02-08 23:48:50 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: If he didnt' what does he do with headphones
[2017-02-08 23:48:55 UTC] yacherdy: right now*
[2017-02-08 23:49:03 UTC] neonbornspartan9: LOL
[2017-02-08 23:49:06 UTC] ands_: @Bammbino no, you still don't know what a detractor is.
[2017-02-08 23:49:17 UTC] yacherdy: peace and love
[2017-02-08 23:49:19 UTC] shotinthedeep: vidar, his headphones is gamefaqs talking to him telling him what to do
[2017-02-08 23:49:21 UTC] shotinthedeep: obviously
[2017-02-08 23:49:23 UTC] naddodr: YokoCherdy
[2017-02-08 23:49:24 UTC] stuart360: Ands_ its YOU who needs to go back and watch his alpha footage
[2017-02-08 23:49:25 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Ands_ look like I said before, I'm actually HOPING the challenge picks up. But so far it's seemed like a pretty easy-going game for DSP. Granted he has experience from the last time he played yeah, and he just played DS recently, but the alpha seemed quite a few degrees more challenging than the typical DS game
[2017-02-08 23:49:29 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: haha @shotindeep
[2017-02-08 23:49:33 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Nobunaga PogChamp

[2017-02-08 23:49:55 UTC] encelor: 10 minutes left
[2017-02-08 23:50:05 UTC] ands_: @hapticbabyman The Alpha was nearly a year ago and only barely resembles the beta or Last Chance Trial.
[2017-02-08 23:50:11 UTC] vendatus: That paragraph WutFace
[2017-02-08 23:50:12 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: ono nobunga hmm
[2017-02-08 23:50:13 UTC] bammbino: Ands_, try reading chat... no one here agrees with your pointless arguement when the game has been nerfed >.> even a mod just said he thinks you're a detractor
[2017-02-08 23:50:27 UTC] encelor: leviatan
[2017-02-08 23:50:39 UTC] neonbornspartan9: This chat is tense... -Picks up the rate of eating ham sandwiches- PogChamp
[2017-02-08 23:50:41 UTC] akioartorius: @DarksydePhil , they are not guitar players. They are Shamisen or Biwa yokai possessed monks. Also water snake spirit nice.
[2017-02-08 23:50:52 UTC] stuart360: loads of streamers have said the game has been nerfed. Expect gaming sites to start writing about it soon as well.
[2017-02-08 23:50:59 UTC] encelor: hari kiri
[2017-02-08 23:51:02 UTC] naddodr: better be careful Ands or the Twitch Police will go after you

[2017-02-08 23:51:09 UTC] bammbino: @neonbornspartan9, its only one guy starting crap w/ people cause he thinks this game is too hard when its not lol
[2017-02-08 23:51:14 UTC] ands_: @Bammbino, cool bud. You're still using detractor wrong.
[2017-02-08 23:51:15 UTC] fluttershy1970: i like phill to play muramasa the demon blade for wii
[2017-02-08 23:51:18 UTC] akioartorius: mizuchi is a white snake that makes great sake
[2017-02-08 23:51:22 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Ands_ so is the final game around the beta/Last Chance demos in challenge? Your opinion? @Bammbino if you played either of those two as well?
[2017-02-08 23:51:26 UTC] furrywulfz: when was DS ever hard though, really
[2017-02-08 23:51:28 UTC] ands_: Uh. No one said the game was "too hard." What the hell.
[2017-02-08 23:51:31 UTC] ands_: @hapticbabyman Yes.
[2017-02-08 23:51:53 UTC] pness17: This game is boring
[2017-02-08 23:51:54 UTC] vendatus: NotLikeThis
[2017-02-08 23:51:57 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Dudes, just stop looking for trouble. Its cool.
[2017-02-08 23:51:58 UTC] marpat1993: bed of chaos
[2017-02-08 23:52:03 UTC] furrywulfz: DS made you think but in terms of what it required from the player,it wasn't much
[2017-02-08 23:52:03 UTC] shotinthedeep: Let's be honest you're comparing it to the alpha when you had no armor then
[2017-02-08 23:52:06 UTC] akioartorius: Phil try out the bull
[2017-02-08 23:52:24 UTC] hapticbabyman: @FurryWulfz agreed
[2017-02-08 23:52:34 UTC] bethe2670: dspHmm

[2017-02-08 23:52:47 UTC] wubegg: Is Phil gonna do every side mission?

[2017-02-08 23:52:52 UTC] mfd4419: @yacherdy yes
[2017-02-08 23:52:52 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Ands_ okay then, you're entitled to that. I'm just waiting for more deaths is all
[2017-02-08 23:52:55 UTC] mfd4419: Lol
[2017-02-08 23:52:58 UTC] jmon_1985: What kind of sandwich?
[2017-02-08 23:53:03 UTC] yacherdy: Ham and cheese
[2017-02-08 23:53:05 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, i died so many times in the last chance beta that i felt like i shouldnt buy the game.. i changed my mind after seeing the reviews giving it 9-10 rating and i have been breezing through the game
[2017-02-08 23:53:16 UTC] yacherdy: actually wait I'm a vegetarian. so no meat
[2017-02-08 23:53:17 UTC] bethe2670: sure yacherdy cheese, lettuce, tomato, ham and brown bread please

[2017-02-08 23:53:36 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, just a sword**
[2017-02-08 23:53:39 UTC] akioartorius: Did Phil forget to press triangle + circle when in living weapon mode? He hasn't done it in a while
[2017-02-08 23:53:39 UTC] ands_: @hapticbabyman Is that really your opinion on if a game is "baby mode. . ." If Burnell can beat it? That. . .is a bit silly.
[2017-02-08 23:53:41 UTC] popsicolo: Make me a grilled cheese TriHard
[2017-02-08 23:53:41 UTC] bethe2670: wait yacherdy

[2017-02-08 23:54:09 UTC] gosoxtim: who the girl
[2017-02-08 23:54:10 UTC] neonbornspartan9: how do you go from saying you're going to make ham/cheese to 'oh wait, I'm vegan'...
[2017-02-08 23:54:11 UTC] mfd4419: I like meat SoonerLater
[2017-02-08 23:54:17 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Bammbino and everything I've been seeing so far has me leaning that way too. But I'll probably never really know until I get around to trying it myself.
[2017-02-08 23:54:17 UTC] yacherdy: @bethe2670 cahman
[2017-02-08 23:54:27 UTC] encelor: companion AI seems bit dull

[2017-02-08 23:54:37 UTC] bethe2670: geez
[2017-02-08 23:54:41 UTC] yacherdy: oh.
[2017-02-08 23:54:42 UTC] duderito2: Ands_ you may not have a popular opinion but at least you kept your cool and explained your reasoning,fraid others can't say that with their autistic screeching of detractor because you don't agree with them.
[2017-02-08 23:54:42 UTC] yacherdy: yeah.
[2017-02-08 23:54:49 UTC] bethe2670: deep i didnt mean it like that
[2017-02-08 23:54:54 UTC] rain64: the girl just got shit on

[2017-02-08 23:55:11 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Ands_ not really. There's other stuff too, like when he was in one of the other missions and the game just gave him the perfect point to snipe an enemy and he didn't have to really go looking for it at all
[2017-02-08 23:55:14 UTC] shotinthedeep: hey duderito2 had a reasonable response
[2017-02-08 23:55:19 UTC] mfd4419: Any witch way KappaPride

[2017-02-08 23:55:33 UTC] hapticbabyman: or how the bosses in the game don't seem to ever block, when the regular enemies do. that's weird design to me.
[2017-02-08 23:55:36 UTC] naddodr: GIRL POWER
[2017-02-08 23:55:39 UTC] neonbornspartan9: talks about insults and calls someone autistic rofl.
[2017-02-08 23:55:39 UTC] bethe2670: ITS RAAAAAAAAWWWWW
[2017-02-08 23:55:45 UTC] vendatus: I'm still waiting for Neo to be a secret boss Kappa
[2017-02-08 23:55:45 UTC] ands_: I mean if he beats Tachibana first try, then maybe he's just god mode at this game.
[2017-02-08 23:55:46 UTC] mfd4419: Raw meats are good to KappaPride
[2017-02-08 23:55:50 UTC] doctorzzz: RIP GRILL
[2017-02-08 23:55:54 UTC] rain64: that girl should go back to the kitchen
[2017-02-08 23:55:55 UTC] ands_: I don't think that's going to happen honestly, and he is the final boss of the area.
[2017-02-08 23:56:02 UTC] shotinthedeep: oh lol. I just read the first half before it was deleted

[2017-02-08 23:56:17 UTC] yacherdy: would you like to see my collection of meats

[2017-02-08 23:56:41 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Ands_ well I'm hoping it's an "entertaining" boss fight.
[2017-02-08 23:56:41 UTC] encelor: Do it - palpatine
[2017-02-08 23:56:45 UTC] bethe2670: any girl i know will punch you in the face so damn hard if you said go back to the kitchen
[2017-02-08 23:56:50 UTC] yacherdy: DELICIOUS MEAT - phil and rambo on heavy rain DLC playthrough
[2017-02-08 23:56:57 UTC] ands_: It's not, and he will whine about how cheap the game is.
[2017-02-08 23:57:02 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, not your fault, but to try to nip this in the bud, google "nioh reddit" when you're on the page, click on search on the right side and type "easy" check off the searching for that specific reddit -- then when it loads the search look in the middle of the page and change all time -> past week and enjoy all the posts and comments saying the game is easy/easier than the beta
[2017-02-08 23:57:08 UTC] yacherdy: go back to the kitchen and make me a vegetarian sammich @bethe2670
[2017-02-08 23:57:13 UTC] mfd4419: @bethe2670 why what's so work with say that

[2017-02-08 23:57:18 UTC] ands_: After whining about how easy it has been.
[2017-02-08 23:57:18 UTC] mfd4419: KappaPride
[2017-02-08 23:57:36 UTC] yacherdy: did you guys know fisting porn is banned
[2017-02-08 23:57:40 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Bammbino I'll be doing that later tonight. thanks for the tip.
[2017-02-08 23:57:44 UTC] furrywulfz: People were whining about how broken the alpha was though, with weapons breaking constantly
[2017-02-08 23:57:57 UTC] ands_: @FurryWulfz The alpha was silly.
[2017-02-08 23:58:12 UTC] shotinthedeep: They overacted to peoples comments about the alpha
[2017-02-08 23:58:13 UTC] vendatus: banned where? MingLee
[2017-02-08 23:58:18 UTC] ands_: I think this is a better game fo it.
[2017-02-08 23:58:21 UTC] ands_: For*
[2017-02-08 23:58:26 UTC] shotinthedeep: Now it's an easy game with no challenge
[2017-02-08 23:58:35 UTC] furrywulfz: the comparison of an audience who wants an insanely hard niche game, and a more casual experience isn't comparable
[2017-02-08 23:58:36 UTC] shotinthedeep: ...and guess what IT HAS NO HARD MODE
[2017-02-08 23:58:38 UTC] yacherdy: In America, I don't believe it's legal to show someone being fisted.
[2017-02-08 23:58:39 UTC] bethe2670: /me makes a vegetarian sandwich
[2017-02-08 23:58:46 UTC] yacherdy: thanks bb

[2017-02-08 23:58:57 UTC] ginosaji48: fucking google images
[2017-02-08 23:59:01 UTC] furrywulfz: compared to a lot of the more challenging games out there on the hardest difficulty, DS is a casual series

[2017-02-08 23:59:25 UTC] marktactics: "manly" guys have spoken
[2017-02-08 23:59:34 UTC] shotinthedeep: I mean if Phil likes playing it like this I have no problem, it's just that there is no way to make this game challenging
[2017-02-08 23:59:38 UTC] yacherdy: thanks...I'm all about that fresh local produce life OneHand
[2017-02-08 23:59:40 UTC] vendatus: Pretty sure all porn in NA is legal except child Kappa
