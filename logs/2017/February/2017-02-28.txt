[2017-02-28 18:51:53 UTC] betheboom: yet...
[2017-02-28 18:52:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: there's always some reviewer that tries to get notoriety by giving a big release a low score 89 reviews on metacritic with one reviewer giving the game 5/10
[2017-02-28 18:52:09 UTC] capstonegaming: he gave nioh perfect scorew almost

[2017-02-28 18:52:31 UTC] soulrider95: You gotta find a reviewer you have the same tastes with

[2017-02-28 18:52:45 UTC] yacherdy: Hello.
[2017-02-28 18:53:00 UTC] yacherdy: more like 45 mins lol
[2017-02-28 18:53:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: true soulrider95 I just wonder sometimes what criteria you need to get included on metacritic
[2017-02-28 18:53:04 UTC] undeadwilliam: So what brings you guys there?
[2017-02-28 18:53:10 UTC] capstonegaming: D:
[2017-02-28 18:53:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey Undeadwilliam
[2017-02-28 18:53:26 UTC] yacherdy: Metacritic user reviews are awful.
[2017-02-28 18:53:35 UTC] yacherdy: I don't care if it's there opinion or not lo
[2017-02-28 18:53:37 UTC] yacherdy: lol
[2017-02-28 18:53:41 UTC] soulrider95: I read Jim Sterling, Giantbomb, some IGN writers

[2017-02-28 18:53:49 UTC] yacherdy: their*
[2017-02-28 18:53:57 UTC] yacherdy: Yes Williams
[2017-02-28 18:53:58 UTC] betheboom: viidar 2 more months and you get gold crown
[2017-02-28 18:54:00 UTC] yacherdy: William*
[2017-02-28 18:54:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Yes Undeadwilliam
[2017-02-28 18:54:02 UTC] yacherdy: can't type :(
[2017-02-28 18:54:05 UTC] undeadwilliam: wait really?
[2017-02-28 18:54:09 UTC] blue_blur64: no lol
[2017-02-28 18:54:15 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I can't wait bethe
[2017-02-28 18:54:18 UTC] undeadwilliam: That's dumb lol
[2017-02-28 18:54:26 UTC] blue_blur64: he was joking undead lol
[2017-02-28 18:54:32 UTC] undeadwilliam: okay lol

[2017-02-28 18:54:56 UTC] betheboom: i will congratulate you with morgue guys and dead babies :D
[2017-02-28 18:54:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: steam user reviews are sometimes useless as well. A game will have a notice warning at the top of the page "can only be played with controller" then there will be 10 reviews can play this with kb and mouse
[2017-02-28 18:55:13 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: thanks
[2017-02-28 18:55:14 UTC] undeadwilliam: So like has anyone heard of China's forced organ harvesting of prisoners of conscience?
[2017-02-28 18:55:15 UTC] theycallmejimbob: cant*
[2017-02-28 18:55:21 UTC] soulrider95: That's why you actually READ reviews and not just look at the score LUL
[2017-02-28 18:55:24 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah, Steam reviews are hit and miss as well.
[2017-02-28 18:55:56 UTC] kingjadvcmp: speaking of reviews, thoughts about the Nioh review?
[2017-02-28 18:55:58 UTC] yacherdy: Mario Kart 64 is 20 fucking years old lel
[2017-02-28 18:56:00 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: It's not that hard getting a controller to a pc either.
[2017-02-28 18:56:13 UTC] soulrider95: Steam supports the Dualshock 4 natively now anyways
[2017-02-28 18:56:18 UTC] yacherdy: I have my Xbox One controller for games on PC that use it.
[2017-02-28 18:56:20 UTC] darksydephil: hello all
[2017-02-28 18:56:23 UTC] betheboom: dsp reviews are the only ones what matter
[2017-02-28 18:56:24 UTC] darksydephil: setting up now
[2017-02-28 18:56:25 UTC] burnout26: I get a collective of scores/reviews before I know if the game is bad. Multiple sources help. Just like news with politics
[2017-02-28 18:56:30 UTC] undeadwilliam: Because China is committing genocide worse than the holocaust again falun gong practitioners, house christains and ethinic mulsims
[2017-02-28 18:56:36 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey Phil
[2017-02-28 18:56:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I use the Xbox 360 controller
[2017-02-28 18:56:52 UTC] undeadwilliam: Actual genocide
[2017-02-28 18:56:54 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: are you serious william?
[2017-02-28 18:57:00 UTC] burnout26: or u can just use a xbox 360 controller
[2017-02-28 18:57:01 UTC] undeadwilliam: Yes
[2017-02-28 18:57:08 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: or a ps3 or ps4
[2017-02-28 18:57:12 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: controller
[2017-02-28 18:57:23 UTC] undeadwilliam: They are killing people for their organs
[2017-02-28 18:57:27 UTC] yacherdy: I gotta say I miss my PS4 controller.
[2017-02-28 18:57:43 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: that isn't news @undeadwilliam
[2017-02-28 18:57:49 UTC] yacherdy: They had that storyline in Mass Effect 1, William..lol
[2017-02-28 18:57:59 UTC] yacherdy: Dr. Heart Kreygasm
[2017-02-28 18:58:14 UTC] undeadwilliam: Its a genocide that deserves to be news as they killing millions of their own citizens
[2017-02-28 18:58:18 UTC] yacherdy: Selling Krogan testicles Kreygasm
[2017-02-28 18:58:32 UTC] betheboom: yacherdy uhhhhhh
[2017-02-28 18:58:33 UTC] theycallmejimbob: did anyone hear about the "Xbox Game Pass" supposedly similar in style to netflix. 10 bucks each month to play a selection of 100 games.
[2017-02-28 18:58:49 UTC] yacherdy: @betheboom HeyGuys
[2017-02-28 18:59:00 UTC] burnout26: well seeing how most people view criminals as lesser humans I can see why they are doing it especially if they are death row ones or life in prison
[2017-02-28 18:59:11 UTC] michigangamer024: good morning all
[2017-02-28 18:59:14 UTC] yacherdy: That's cool Jimbob...nothing I would use, though.
[2017-02-28 18:59:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: evening MichiganGamer024
[2017-02-28 18:59:22 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: millions of chinese die all the time, but there are billions of them. Nothing you can do with what they decide anyways
[2017-02-28 18:59:27 UTC] undeadwilliam: You need only look at the number of transplants they do every year, the number of voluntary donated and prisoners excuted for murder and rape that they admit they have taken the organs from
[2017-02-28 18:59:32 UTC] betheboom: if krogans have 4 balls then what do the women have?
[2017-02-28 18:59:37 UTC] undeadwilliam: The numbers don't add up.
[2017-02-28 18:59:50 UTC] yacherdy: @betheboom Hmmmm...I've never though about that.
[2017-02-28 19:00:10 UTC] undeadwilliam: These aren't criminals they are simply people of various faiths and political dissentents
[2017-02-28 19:00:44 UTC] undeadwilliam: Not when they are being slaughtered by a corrupt authoritarian government
[2017-02-28 19:00:47 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah welcome to communism
[2017-02-28 19:01:03 UTC] bleedout1234565: hahahaha
[2017-02-28 19:01:08 UTC] undeadwilliam: Its a holocaust pure and simple for profit and power.
[2017-02-28 19:01:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: speaking of Politics :( I seen my first Trump protest poster today
[2017-02-28 19:01:24 UTC] betheboom: watching emmerdale :D
[2017-02-28 19:01:29 UTC] burnout26: just like how they cut off water and electrcity to force u to leave your home because they want to build a highway there
[2017-02-28 19:01:30 UTC] bleedout1234565: welp
[2017-02-28 19:01:52 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you a fan of Gemma Atkinson betheboom?

[2017-02-28 19:02:51 UTC] bleedout1234565: what stalin did was just as bad but people say hitler was worst because it was because of race
[2017-02-28 19:03:17 UTC] burnout26: u mean religion I dont think jewish is a race
[2017-02-28 19:03:24 UTC] yacherdy: Let's all join the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement.

[2017-02-28 23:15:51 UTC] radicaldreamer1: but it was also rushed as fuck
[2017-02-28 23:15:55 UTC] stuart360: Who would of loved MGSV if it had nothing to do with Kojima?. I mean that game was literally 'camp infiltrator simulator' lol
[2017-02-28 23:15:56 UTC] radicaldreamer1: like most Konami Games :P
[2017-02-28 23:16:00 UTC] kinggoken: yes it was rushed
[2017-02-28 23:16:09 UTC] bobbi_ling: the pointiest point
[2017-02-28 23:16:12 UTC] bobbi_ling: tpp
[2017-02-28 23:16:13 UTC] radicaldreamer1: yeah it was no traditional MGS game
[2017-02-28 23:16:14 UTC] kinggoken: good open world though. Good gameplay. Meh story
[2017-02-28 23:16:17 UTC] bobbi_ling: great game

[2017-02-28 23:16:48 UTC] ambervisage: Rising Revengeance was also no tradtional game either but it was great
[2017-02-28 23:16:50 UTC] radicaldreamer1: its an okay game in my book
[2017-02-28 23:16:53 UTC] bobbi_ling: silence casul
[2017-02-28 23:16:58 UTC] radicaldreamer1: considering it has no real ending sucks
[2017-02-28 23:17:07 UTC] royal_phalanx91: MGS V open world is kinda empty
[2017-02-28 23:17:07 UTC] kinggoken: Rising was awesome. Would love to see a sequel
[2017-02-28 23:17:15 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: ResidentSleeper
[2017-02-28 23:17:16 UTC] radicaldreamer1: also you have to replay missions in chapter 2 which is a sign of lazyness DansGame
[2017-02-28 23:17:19 UTC] stuart360: The next Konami MGS may well be better than MGSV but it will be hated by Kojima fans.
[2017-02-28 23:17:21 UTC] betheboom: bobbi sucks bobbi sucks bobbi sucks
[2017-02-28 23:17:22 UTC] ambervisage: Rising was so satisfying, good god i loved that game

[2017-02-28 23:17:51 UTC] mfd4419: For the ps4
[2017-02-28 23:17:54 UTC] vendatus: Rising has a sequel it's called Nier Automata Kappa
[2017-02-28 23:17:57 UTC] radicaldreamer1: yea
[2017-02-28 23:18:05 UTC] radicaldreamer1: because the fanbase feels betrayed Kappa

[2017-02-28 23:18:23 UTC] stuart360: The fanbase is warped
[2017-02-28 23:18:23 UTC] kinggoken: Nier is out in Japan right now and it has an English dub
[2017-02-28 23:18:25 UTC] micgelo09: question have u seen gameplay of mg survive @radicaldreamer1 \
[2017-02-28 23:18:38 UTC] kinggoken: i watched someonep lay it yesterday. He sucked at the game by the way but the game looked alright.

[2017-02-28 23:18:48 UTC] radicaldreamer1: a little bit @Micgelo09

[2017-02-28 23:19:40 UTC] micgelo09: at least wait on release date
[2017-02-28 23:19:42 UTC] boxman222: why the fuck is the sound mostly only coming out from right speaker when they are speaking?
[2017-02-28 23:19:44 UTC] radicaldreamer1: watch the TGS 2016 gameplay trailer :P
[2017-02-28 23:20:01 UTC] masternutella: I've never played metal gear solid games, so idk why it has so much dislike
[2017-02-28 23:20:02 UTC] dukaduka: nothing i could do! Kreygasm
[2017-02-28 23:20:08 UTC] radicaldreamer1: its just a shitty multiplayer based game now
[2017-02-28 23:20:12 UTC] kinggoken: dspNothing
[2017-02-28 23:20:12 UTC] micgelo09: direction of speaker @boxman222
[2017-02-28 23:20:14 UTC] radicaldreamer1: why should i wait that long?
[2017-02-28 23:20:15 UTC] iconicmaster1: It's awesome Kong
[2017-02-28 23:20:16 UTC] 0megaj0ker: this chick had no head tracking
[2017-02-28 23:20:27 UTC] dukaduka: why couldnt she just turn her head 90 degrees? Kappa
[2017-02-28 23:20:27 UTC] 0megaj0ker: *has
[2017-02-28 23:20:30 UTC] boxman222: mcgelo09: makes no sense since that one character was on left side of camera
[2017-02-28 23:20:37 UTC] kinggoken: lol awesome kong
[2017-02-28 23:20:51 UTC] bobbi_ling: do the beth dance cmon now TheRinger / \ TheRinger
[2017-02-28 23:20:56 UTC] kharimane: so theyer using the wonderful engine kojima and crew made to ruin the series
[2017-02-28 23:20:59 UTC] kharimane: how interesting
[2017-02-28 23:21:09 UTC] bradleymason1993: ^^
[2017-02-28 23:21:14 UTC] radicaldreamer1: i know its better to wait until you judge about something but this is just plain wrong
[2017-02-28 23:21:22 UTC] capstonegaming: rain all of the sudden
[2017-02-28 23:21:24 UTC] micgelo09: well they may change it hell might even have a beta for true judgement instead of watching a game not finished in development yet @radicaldreamer1
[2017-02-28 23:21:31 UTC] boxman222: so how is this game anyways?? another overrated exclusive?
[2017-02-28 23:21:34 UTC] freshsqueezedbabyoil: Robots love rain
[2017-02-28 23:21:37 UTC] boxman222: overhyped*
[2017-02-28 23:21:42 UTC] vendatus: Awesome Kong vs. Nia Jax at WM book it WWE VoHiYo
[2017-02-28 23:21:43 UTC] kharimane: look at all this stuff they didnt use guys
[2017-02-28 23:21:50 UTC] quinn800: @boxman222 its great
[2017-02-28 23:22:00 UTC] kharimane: we can practically make a whole new game LOL FUCK KOJIMA
[2017-02-28 23:22:02 UTC] bradleymason1993: boxman222, honestly it doesnt look anything special tbh :/
[2017-02-28 23:22:09 UTC] kinggoken: Does Awesome Kong still wrestle?
[2017-02-28 23:22:11 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Rain, that mean the robos are weak now, or are they Samsung water proof TriHard
[2017-02-28 23:22:15 UTC] boxman222: phil does not sound very enthusiastic about it at least
[2017-02-28 23:22:15 UTC] ambervisage: its has nice story
[2017-02-28 23:22:16 UTC] stuart360: No one knows what went on with Konami and Kojima, and we probably never will know the 100% truth. I'd be willing to bet that Kojima was getting too big for his boots though so to speak
[2017-02-28 23:22:23 UTC] betheboom: vendatus ewww that is like the female version of brock vs goldberg
[2017-02-28 23:22:27 UTC] kinggoken: also these graphics are TIGHT and DSP isn't even playing on the PS4 Pro
[2017-02-28 23:22:33 UTC] bobbi_ling: cover your hair its raining
[2017-02-28 23:22:39 UTC] radicaldreamer1: kojima wasted too much money for developing the fox engine
[2017-02-28 23:22:40 UTC] quinn800: @boxman222 his been playing for like 3 hours
[2017-02-28 23:22:41 UTC] radicaldreamer1: could be a rumor
[2017-02-28 23:22:50 UTC] boxman222: and still the audio comes from right speaker... no matter where the characters are actually located
[2017-02-28 23:22:55 UTC] stuart360: The Pro looks just the same except higher res
[2017-02-28 23:22:57 UTC] bradleymason1993: stuart360, I heard kojima was getting fed up of making shitty sequels for konami just for more money so he left
[2017-02-28 23:23:03 UTC] shotinthedeep: Lol
[2017-02-28 23:23:06 UTC] casemoney: @boxman222 sure buddy
[2017-02-28 23:23:11 UTC] radicaldreamer1: and with most konami games they have to face an unfair deadline in terms of development
[2017-02-28 23:23:12 UTC] vendatus: but Bethe still betrer than every match on Raw Kappa
[2017-02-28 23:23:13 UTC] masternutella: Why do this type of games their teeth and hair are clean af

[2017-02-28 23:23:19 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: ResidentSleeper SAII
[2017-02-28 23:23:26 UTC] quinn800: @betheboom not even kong is a amazing wrestler
[2017-02-28 23:23:27 UTC] kharimane: death stranding might be the game of the century
[2017-02-28 23:23:35 UTC] stuart360: Well lets not forget that Kojima said MGS2 was the last Metal Gear. He says it after every game
[2017-02-28 23:23:38 UTC] micgelo09: no @boxman222 its basically after the evens of metal gear operations you and 4 people play as the mother base operatives sucked in a portal and stuck in a world of monsters your goal is to find a way home
[2017-02-28 23:23:47 UTC] radicaldreamer1: what you see in a trailer on e3 or TGS is mostly the finished game
[2017-02-28 23:23:50 UTC] lightweightbro: wtf, why are the views so low
[2017-02-28 23:23:59 UTC] masternutella: Because ppl left?
[2017-02-28 23:24:00 UTC] kinggoken: because this game is kind of zzzzzzz
[2017-02-28 23:24:01 UTC] radicaldreamer1: which in the end gets downgraded because consoles cant handle what they show in a trailer
[2017-02-28 23:24:04 UTC] lightweightbro: is it boring?
[2017-02-28 23:24:04 UTC] bradleymason1993: stuart360, yeah exactly, and then konami milk even more out of the franchise from him
[2017-02-28 23:24:05 UTC] bobbi_ling: please i need 3 apples do my quest
[2017-02-28 23:24:11 UTC] revolt_evolve: why does the main character sound like Chloe from Life is Strange?
[2017-02-28 23:24:13 UTC] kinggoken: although dans gaming had like 11k people watching him for whatever reason..
[2017-02-28 23:24:17 UTC] soulrider95: It's boring to watch, playing it is a lot of fun
[2017-02-28 23:24:21 UTC] dukaduka: T H O K K
[2017-02-28 23:24:21 UTC] lightweightbro: whos dans gaming
[2017-02-28 23:24:27 UTC] kinggoken: a twitch streamer
[2017-02-28 23:24:29 UTC] micgelo09: y should u care about views @LightWeightBro
[2017-02-28 23:24:33 UTC] wersk: god the voice acting is so bad

[2017-02-28 23:24:47 UTC] lightweightbro: just stating the obvious
[2017-02-28 23:24:47 UTC] darksteel78: You can do these before The Proving
[2017-02-28 23:24:49 UTC] stuart360: He didn't have to keep making them though
[2017-02-28 23:24:54 UTC] mfd4419: I think most games are getting boring to watch latly
[2017-02-28 23:24:57 UTC] kinggoken: and yes there should be more people here @LightWeightBro
[2017-02-28 23:24:59 UTC] boxman222: seems like whoever did the sound work for this game had no idea what they were doing
[2017-02-28 23:25:00 UTC] kinggoken: DSP is THE guy
[2017-02-28 23:25:04 UTC] lightweightbro: right
[2017-02-28 23:25:04 UTC] dukaduka: @Vendatus, new games are free views and that means more $$
[2017-02-28 23:25:09 UTC] stuart360: I think Kojima was pissed off that Konami was quitting games, at that time
[2017-02-28 23:25:14 UTC] micgelo09: y state the obvious when the obvious is already here

[2017-02-28 23:25:54 UTC] capstonegaming: lol
[2017-02-28 23:25:55 UTC] radicaldreamer1: but it sounds reasonable for me that the fox engine was expensive as fuck
[2017-02-28 23:25:55 UTC] lightweightbro: you're fighting with me
[2017-02-28 23:25:57 UTC] kinggoken: dsp must REALLY like this game since he hasn't taken a break yet

[2017-02-28 23:26:31 UTC] stuart360: Fox engine struggled on XB1 at first as well, 720p lol.

[2017-02-28 23:26:46 UTC] radicaldreamer1: because the consoles are shitty dood
[2017-02-28 23:26:53 UTC] ambervisage: i like games that have a story you want to figure out quickly cause its so compelling
[2017-02-28 23:27:01 UTC] vendatus: duka we'll bang okay? just like Dan and Kaidan KappaPride

[2017-02-28 23:27:24 UTC] stuart360: The funny thing is that PES takes hardly any resources on PC, i play at 4k/60fps with plenty of room to spare lool
[2017-02-28 23:27:36 UTC] radicaldreamer1: yea
[2017-02-28 23:27:42 UTC] bradleymason1993: radicaldreamer1, good job Scorpio is on the horizon then
[2017-02-28 23:27:44 UTC] radicaldreamer1: works better on a powerful PC eh? :P

[2017-02-28 23:28:10 UTC] stuart360: My PC isn't even that powerful anymore, overclocked 970
[2017-02-28 23:28:15 UTC] radicaldreamer1: and which games are we play on it? Halo and Gow4? DansGame

[2017-02-28 23:28:28 UTC] radicaldreamer1: well
[2017-02-28 23:28:32 UTC] ambervisage: you dont need a stronger console if there are no games for it
[2017-02-28 23:28:33 UTC] ambervisage: LUL
[2017-02-28 23:28:35 UTC] mfd4419: Wat lol

[2017-02-28 23:28:50 UTC] bradleymason1993: lol there are no games for it cos it isnt coming out any time soon
[2017-02-28 23:28:53 UTC] radicaldreamer1: you know that consoles always have to give some RAM for the interface right?
[2017-02-28 23:28:59 UTC] mfd4419: It is a wall
[2017-02-28 23:29:00 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: i want to go rock climbing now
[2017-02-28 23:29:02 UTC] radicaldreamer1: which is a big flaw compared to the pc
[2017-02-28 23:29:12 UTC] metarrixxxx: ahahahhahaa
[2017-02-28 23:29:13 UTC] ambervisage: love the scale
[2017-02-28 23:29:14 UTC] stuart360: Well to be fair, multiplatform games make up like 95% of all games so if Scorpuio runs them games better, people will want to play on Scorpio, just like now with PS4
[2017-02-28 23:29:15 UTC] freshsqueezedbabyoil: Stick the prayer beads up your ass.

[2017-02-28 23:29:37 UTC] radicaldreamer1: :D
[2017-02-28 23:29:44 UTC] dukaduka: its also a pc, so its a multi tool compared to a dedicated console
[2017-02-28 23:29:45 UTC] radicaldreamer1: ps4 pro 2.0
[2017-02-28 23:29:46 UTC] dball3r429: Ta

[2017-02-28 23:30:25 UTC] boxman222: you have no idea what the scorpio will cost

[2017-02-28 23:31:00 UTC] dukaduka: the reliability, price, and consistency of consoles is why they are popular. remove those and its basically a pc

[2017-02-28 23:33:27 UTC] shotinthedeep: It's gonna probably be$800+ stuart
[2017-02-28 23:33:27 UTC] marshmelons: native 4k console at $400 sounds suspicious
[2017-02-28 23:33:27 UTC] mfd4419: Wst
[2017-02-28 23:33:28 UTC] radicaldreamer1: I'd rather buy a nice PC for 800
[2017-02-28 23:33:31 UTC] bradleymason1993: MasterNutella, why are you saying that in the form of a question?! Noone knows
[2017-02-28 23:33:32 UTC] ambervisage: @theycallmejimbob, Agreed! xD
[2017-02-28 23:33:38 UTC] radicaldreamer1: 800 for a console
[2017-02-28 23:33:39 UTC] masternutella: Someone said
[2017-02-28 23:33:39 UTC] boxman222: stuart360: that was because it was both more expensive and underpowered compared to the ps4 in first place
[2017-02-28 23:33:40 UTC] radicaldreamer1: lol
[2017-02-28 23:33:41 UTC] doctorzzz: they lead you to tge path
[2017-02-28 23:33:45 UTC] micgelo09: MOTHA
[2017-02-28 23:33:47 UTC] shotinthedeep: It's said to be "high-end"
[2017-02-28 23:33:56 UTC] masternutella: If it's $800 imma lol
[2017-02-28 23:33:59 UTC] mfd4419: I'm getting it
[2017-02-28 23:34:05 UTC] boxman222: and that is ignoring all the drama surrounding the DRM crap
[2017-02-28 23:34:06 UTC] mfd4419: Will see
[2017-02-28 23:34:06 UTC] rgnine: is this on the ps4 pro?
[2017-02-28 23:34:11 UTC] radicaldreamer1: a pc will always be better than this so called high end console :P
[2017-02-28 23:34:12 UTC] boxman222: which was also a big part of why it did ot sell very well
[2017-02-28 23:34:26 UTC] mikebpfallon: you have healing potions
[2017-02-28 23:34:29 UTC] vendatus: $800 isn't that much MingLee
[2017-02-28 23:34:35 UTC] masternutella: lol
[2017-02-28 23:34:39 UTC] masternutella: Funny
[2017-02-28 23:34:42 UTC] ambervisage: if its 800$ then we'll ask for microsoft to point us out to where they buy their fine weed from
[2017-02-28 23:34:56 UTC] boxman222: my bet is that it is going to be $499
[2017-02-28 23:35:09 UTC] betheboom: running and sneaking around killing robots and exploring :D
[2017-02-28 23:35:10 UTC] bradleymason1993: $499 sounds more reasonable lol
[2017-02-28 23:35:12 UTC] stuart360: Yeah that was my point, it needs to match the Pro in price for it to be desirable to the masses
[2017-02-28 23:35:13 UTC] capstonegaming: phil still crankin away at it
[2017-02-28 23:35:14 UTC] shotinthedeep: No way boxman
[2017-02-28 23:35:16 UTC] betheboom: i love it
[2017-02-28 23:35:26 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: dependson how you value your money. i make enough to buy it, but it seems absurd to do it.
[2017-02-28 23:35:35 UTC] shotinthedeep: Bethefun
[2017-02-28 23:35:38 UTC] bradleymason1993: stuart360, although you say that, by all accounts its gonna be more powerful than the pro
[2017-02-28 23:35:38 UTC] micgelo09: 499? good luck getting a gud performance for yer pc
[2017-02-28 23:35:42 UTC] micgelo09: lol
[2017-02-28 23:35:42 UTC] masternutella: I mean if it's going to be $800 it better play at 60 fps all games
[2017-02-28 23:35:45 UTC] mfd4419: Side quests are as repetitive as the dragon age inquisition
[2017-02-28 23:35:48 UTC] boxman222: shotinthedeep: remember it is basically a new generation of the AMD apu's.. does not meant it has to be that much more expensive
[2017-02-28 23:35:54 UTC] vendatus: base model $500 deluxe model $800 SeemsGood
[2017-02-28 23:36:02 UTC] boxman222: we already know the specs.. it is basically a rx 480
[2017-02-28 23:36:14 UTC] radicaldreamer1: lol if you build you own pc you get something better for 400 than a ps4 pro Kreygasm
[2017-02-28 23:36:21 UTC] gameboy_xp: how long will phil stream? 8
[2017-02-28 23:36:22 UTC] lightweightbro: this is kinda boring

[2017-02-28 23:36:25 UTC] radicaldreamer1: as long as you know what to buy
[2017-02-28 23:36:26 UTC] stuart360: Its considerably more powerful than the Pro, but the masses are with Sony this gen, Microsoft have to price Scorpio well for people to bite
[2017-02-28 23:36:32 UTC] radicaldreamer1: sure
[2017-02-28 23:36:34 UTC] marshmelons: either microsoft takes heavy losses on every unit sold or scorpio upscales to 4k
[2017-02-28 23:36:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: another 25 mins Gameboy_XP

[2017-02-28 23:37:08 UTC] boxman222: it is going to be 30fps at 4k.. dont need insane power to do that with console optimizations
[2017-02-28 23:37:12 UTC] bradleymason1993: the more i watch of this game, the less interested i become in it lol
[2017-02-28 23:37:14 UTC] radicaldreamer1: if you don't know what to buy. yeah then you're fucked :P
[2017-02-28 23:37:15 UTC] betheboom: i think this is a game which is super Boring to watch
[2017-02-28 23:37:24 UTC] betheboom: but it is super fun to play

[2017-02-28 23:45:11 UTC] masternutella: I see what you did there then
[2017-02-28 23:45:18 UTC] stuart360: A few months ago the dev said that it was still coming. The guess is that it will turn into a Dark Souls clone and thats why its been so long in development
[2017-02-28 23:45:21 UTC] radicaldreamer1: I'd rather have a DMC5 than Deep Down tbh
[2017-02-28 23:45:30 UTC] stuart360: There are vids on Youtube of the game from last year
[2017-02-28 23:45:30 UTC] radicaldreamer1: oh
[2017-02-28 23:45:34 UTC] tormentedmayhem17: And why is that a bad thing...? You can play across multiple platforms. Sony should do the same, instead of forcing people to buy their console for 1 game.
[2017-02-28 23:45:38 UTC] radicaldreamer1: but 4 player co-op is no dark souls clone :o
[2017-02-28 23:45:43 UTC] radicaldreamer1: well its a dungeon crawler

[2017-02-28 23:47:02 UTC] stuart360: Microsoft releasing their games on PC is a good thing business wise. More money for them and they can sell consoles for the masses, and the hatrdcore will buy their games on PC
[2017-02-28 23:47:08 UTC] anondublo1: absolutely terrible

[2017-02-28 23:48:49 UTC] stuart360: Well very few people would buy a PC over a console to play Halo. Its not like they are losing console sales because they are releasing games on PC.

[2017-02-28 23:54:07 UTC] radicaldreamer1: that asian npc was blinking ;)
[2017-02-28 23:54:08 UTC] stuart360: It is nice to have the added dialogue options to be fair, as long as they actually mean something though
[2017-02-28 23:54:08 UTC] capstonegaming: stop smiling at me
[2017-02-28 23:54:09 UTC] defy1ng_gr4vity: Another KoToR needs to be made

[2017-02-28 23:54:28 UTC] radicaldreamer1: the blinks are too fast for you Kappa

[2017-02-28 23:54:55 UTC] messenger2009: padding the game
[2017-02-28 23:54:56 UTC] gladefinder: This game makes me overblink to overcompensate for the weird vibe
[2017-02-28 23:54:56 UTC] stuart360: Riddick is such a cool charactee, we need more games
[2017-02-28 23:54:56 UTC] vendatus: Pitch Black best of the 4 movies
[2017-02-28 23:54:57 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I was sooooo hoping Karl Urban would come back for another scene at the end, with the fear of Riddick in him when he finds out a ship left that planet
[2017-02-28 23:54:57 UTC] radicaldreamer1: OhMyDog
[2017-02-28 23:55:12 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: There eyes in this new world are constantly supplied with a saline solution across the scelra through the lacrimal canal and thus not requiring blinking NotATK
[2017-02-28 23:55:15 UTC] betheboom: there is 4?
[2017-02-28 23:55:22 UTC] betheboom: thought there were only 3
[2017-02-28 23:55:24 UTC] phoenixrising2015: One is an anime
[2017-02-28 23:55:25 UTC] bammbino: @shotinthedeep, do you know what he chose to say to Rost?
[2017-02-28 23:55:29 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Its only 40 minutes
[2017-02-28 23:55:33 UTC] micgelo09: he's not a genious
[2017-02-28 23:55:48 UTC] gladefinder: When does this take place? They've evolved the need to no longer blink, saline solution?
[2017-02-28 23:55:48 UTC] vendatus: Dark Fury is the animated one
[2017-02-28 23:55:51 UTC] ambervisage: take the plunge phil
[2017-02-28 23:55:51 UTC] stuart360: Butcher Bay is a still a good game, i played it a few months ago
[2017-02-28 23:55:53 UTC] gladefinder: Keeps them more alert?
[2017-02-28 23:55:54 UTC] phoenixrising2015: It shows what happened after Pitch Black and before Chronicles
[2017-02-28 23:55:57 UTC] ambervisage: you are experienced
[2017-02-28 23:56:04 UTC] micgelo09: this is a witcher moment i guarantee shes gonna die letting her stay with him
[2017-02-28 23:56:04 UTC] betheboom: ok an anime one im never gunna watch
[2017-02-28 23:56:09 UTC] anondublo1: blinking is for straight white men
[2017-02-28 23:56:14 UTC] shotinthedeep: He's always using the intelligent options.
[2017-02-28 23:56:16 UTC] imteyza: is this game worth $60

[2017-02-28 23:56:34 UTC] radicaldreamer1: better wait 2 or 3 months :o
[2017-02-28 23:56:36 UTC] gladefinder: People were telling me it's really repetitive
[2017-02-28 23:56:36 UTC] vendatus: It's good tho Bethe VoHiYo
[2017-02-28 23:56:39 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Yeah all it is is Riddick and the crew from Pitch Black facing problems, and I think it sets up Chronicles. I never watched it either
[2017-02-28 23:56:43 UTC] stuart360: If you like Tomb Raider and Far Cry etc, you will like this game
[2017-02-28 23:56:49 UTC] anondublo1: it looks generic as fuck imo
[2017-02-28 23:56:56 UTC] micgelo09: y is hanzo not in this game
[2017-02-28 23:56:59 UTC] ambervisage: night time is awesome

[2017-02-28 23:57:07 UTC] gladefinder: Why is Mitsurugi not in-game
[2017-02-28 23:57:07 UTC] micgelo09: the perfect bowman
[2017-02-28 23:57:19 UTC] defy1ng_gr4vity: Scrub bowman*
[2017-02-28 23:57:22 UTC] micgelo09: mr miagi
[2017-02-28 23:57:23 UTC] leonaras: When twitch and chill outperforms a new game, feelsbadman.
[2017-02-28 23:57:26 UTC] podusmonens: stuart did you see the amd vega conference?
[2017-02-28 23:57:29 UTC] stuart360: I'm one of the few people who really liked Chronicles of Riddick
[2017-02-28 23:57:29 UTC] defy1ng_gr4vity: He needs scatter shots to get kills
[2017-02-28 23:57:30 UTC] ambervisage: and i love night time so from the looks of it night stays for a good amount of time so
[2017-02-28 23:57:30 UTC] imteyza: lots of bugs rn tho i was running through rocks and shit
[2017-02-28 23:57:34 UTC] gladefinder: Err, I mean "Hanzo," Mitsurugi, whatever his name is

[2017-02-28 23:58:30 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: KappaPride
[2017-02-28 23:58:30 UTC] gladefinder: Hanzo is just the name Mitsurugi adopted when he decided to play with bows
[2017-02-28 23:58:31 UTC] defy1ng_gr4vity: I guess this is as close to Turok as I'll get
[2017-02-28 23:58:31 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But yeah, I like superhero Riddick.
[2017-02-28 23:58:39 UTC] stuart360: The race against the sun on that planet was great
[2017-02-28 23:58:44 UTC] anondublo1: go watch the first quiplash video for it
[2017-02-28 23:58:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I get the point of "Riddick" but I wanted revenge at the end
[2017-02-28 23:58:48 UTC] anondublo1: it's fucking brutal

[2017-02-28 23:59:22 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Riddick is good in that most of the film is just audio and visual

[2017-02-28 23:59:41 UTC] bammbino: @betheboom, i had left the stream and just took a break to see how far he got
[2017-02-28 23:59:41 UTC] capstonegaming: Batista = The Rock and Triple h combined
[2017-02-28 23:59:52 UTC] leonaras: A wise man once said: This stream should be titled Horizon : Zero views.
[2017-02-28 23:59:57 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh boy
