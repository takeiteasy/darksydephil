[2017-02-04 19:55:24 UTC] darksydephil: well you can't be THAT demanding with fighters, its never gonna be perfect. id say 60ms and under is acceptable
[2017-02-04 19:55:39 UTC] darksydephil: at least from what i saw yesterday,a nything around there was fine. above that had noticeable lag
[2017-02-04 19:55:54 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the 133ms pings were like slideshow at times

[2017-02-04 19:56:42 UTC] darksydephil: so im back to using my turtle beach xp seven headphones
[2017-02-04 19:56:55 UTC] darksydephil: for those who don't know, these are the headphones i started using in 2013 when i first went to direct capture, lol
[2017-02-04 19:57:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the ones that are damaged?
[2017-02-04 19:57:15 UTC] darksydephil: ive come full circle. started with turtle beach, then trittons, then astro a40s, back to trittons, now turtle beach
[2017-02-04 19:57:30 UTC] darksydephil: yeah, well i used the turtle beach for all of 2013 and into 2014, then they broke
[2017-02-04 19:57:53 UTC] darksydephil: so i got them fixed under warranty and started using the trittons. within like 5 months the trittons cracked and i sent THEM in under warranty
[2017-02-04 19:58:11 UTC] darksydephil: so then for the rest of 2014 and into 2016 i just used the astro a40s
[2017-02-04 19:58:24 UTC] bethe2670: well at least you had back-ups
[2017-02-04 19:58:49 UTC] darksydephil: but then when i started using the PSVR, i decided to switch back to the trittons and....now they broke again. so thats 4 months of use, AGAIN, and they cracked. the design is just shit, and they're no longer under warranty, so they're basically garbage now
[2017-02-04 19:59:45 UTC] darksydephil: the good thing about the turtle beach ones, they have the best mixer hardware. so like, you get GREAT base, voices stand out, you can even manually adjust the surround sound levels if something sounds off or too low, loud. i really liked them a lot when i was using them for that year
[2017-02-04 19:59:50 UTC] darksydephil: so hopefully they don't f'ing break again
[2017-02-04 20:00:58 UTC] bethe2670: hopefully they wont

[2017-02-04 20:07:14 UTC] neonbornspartan9: i mean, hector bellerin suffered a concussion after the first header goal on his side
[2017-02-04 20:07:16 UTC] bethe2670: barely any shots except the goal and that was cause chelsea backed off a bit because we knew we already won
[2017-02-04 20:07:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Costa was greedy near the end bethe he should of passed it instead of shooting from a bad angle
[2017-02-04 20:07:40 UTC] bethe2670: costa is always like that
[2017-02-04 20:08:03 UTC] bethe2670: who spartan :D

[2017-02-04 20:11:35 UTC] bethe2670: i like the animation
[2017-02-04 20:11:42 UTC] darksydephil: i love the awards shows, they just reward any movie that isn't the norm
[2017-02-04 20:11:49 UTC] bethe2670: true
[2017-02-04 20:11:53 UTC] darksydephil: remember that "silent film" with the dog a few years back??

[2017-02-04 20:12:22 UTC] darksydephil: black and white, no spoken dialogue
[2017-02-04 20:12:37 UTC] neonbornspartan9: i mean, that's the point i think. it's about movies that defeat the norm, are innovative, and required a lot work to produce.
[2017-02-04 20:12:41 UTC] darksydephil: i saw it, it was good but it didnt blow me away. they just reward stuff that's purposely not the mainstream
[2017-02-04 20:13:03 UTC] bethe2670: hmm so its like old black and white silent mick mouse shit
[2017-02-04 20:13:11 UTC] bethe2670: except with real people
[2017-02-04 20:13:18 UTC] darksydephil: just comes off as snooty to me, i dunno. like Journey winning game of hte year over stuff that was far better and took a lot more work
[2017-02-04 20:13:34 UTC] neonbornspartan9: oh, game is different lol
[2017-02-04 20:13:37 UTC] darksydephil: but to each their own
[2017-02-04 20:13:38 UTC] bethe2670: i dont believe award shows
[2017-02-04 20:13:41 UTC] neonbornspartan9: idk about game awards
[2017-02-04 20:13:45 UTC] darksydephil: ok let me tweet that we're live

[2017-02-04 20:14:43 UTC] darksydephil: i didnt see and wont ever see la la land so i have no idea lol
[2017-02-04 20:14:53 UTC] darksydephil: i have no desire to see those actors dancing and singing on cars
[2017-02-04 20:14:54 UTC] general_reginald: la la la ebola
[2017-02-04 20:15:14 UTC] neonbornspartan9: i mean yea, musical is not everyone's thing.
[2017-02-04 20:15:20 UTC] bethe2670: i might watch la la land when it comes on tv like 2 years from now :D
[2017-02-04 20:15:22 UTC] darksydephil: im not even sure if RYan Gossling or whatever is an actor, just a pretty face
[2017-02-04 20:15:34 UTC] ginosaji48: i havent watch the movie yet, but from short video i saw i can see its gonna be bs
[2017-02-04 20:15:47 UTC] general_reginald: Ryan Gosling was in a movie called Drive, it was really boring
[2017-02-04 20:15:58 UTC] neonbornspartan9: .....
[2017-02-04 20:16:02 UTC] bethe2670: i like musicals like mary poppins, oliver, seven brides for seven brothers, calamity jane and grease
[2017-02-04 20:16:30 UTC] peidinfull: Hey Phil :)
[2017-02-04 20:17:00 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Musicals aren't to be taken seriously. The choreography is good though.
[2017-02-04 20:17:16 UTC] bethe2670: i take em seriously Kappa
[2017-02-04 20:17:25 UTC] bethe2670: most of em are funny as fuck though
[2017-02-04 20:17:25 UTC] ginosaji48: fuck yakuza, but still better than fucking persona games
[2017-02-04 20:18:02 UTC] bethe2670: gino the only thing you like in yakuza is the beautiful sexy japanese girls :D
[2017-02-04 20:18:05 UTC] general_reginald: I want to see a musical with really bad choreography, with actors tripping down stairs and shit
[2017-02-04 20:18:07 UTC] 562801: @Ginosaji48 how do you not like persona
[2017-02-04 20:18:10 UTC] neonbornspartan9: i mean the story was really realistic, and i think Phil would relate to it with his life, but the dancing shouldn't be taken seriously. it's in it's own world, it's obviously not happening.
[2017-02-04 20:18:18 UTC] bethe2670: i dont like persona either
[2017-02-04 20:18:23 UTC] ginosaji48: /me slaps bethe2670
[2017-02-04 20:18:24 UTC] bethe2670: HOW DO YOU LIKE PERSONA

[2017-02-04 21:37:43 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Do you play as Maejima this entire game? Is it just an origin story of why he ends up the way he does?
[2017-02-04 21:37:44 UTC] bethe2670: assassins creed as better ai than this

[2017-02-04 21:38:28 UTC] football2008: you play as kiryu and majima @Phoenixrising2015
[2017-02-04 21:38:33 UTC] rosshardie: The AI is a lot better in actual fights though. Especially on hard mode.
[2017-02-04 21:38:35 UTC] kiyoshi_maeda: Lol mafia 1 had better ai
[2017-02-04 21:38:39 UTC] royal_phalanx91: this is not the worst AI in gaming I've seen

[2017-02-04 21:39:50 UTC] bethe2670: mafia 1 was probably even better ai
[2017-02-04 21:39:56 UTC] ginosaji48: they still can up the ai in m3 with those story dlc's
[2017-02-04 21:39:59 UTC] kiyoshi_maeda: It was @bethe2670

[2017-02-04 21:41:05 UTC] bethe2670: i didnt like that it was too easy to stealth everything in mafia 3 cause stupid ai otherwise i liked everything
[2017-02-04 21:41:15 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I like the whole "Punisher" aspect it had but they overdid the work needed for your vengeance
[2017-02-04 21:41:24 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I liked all the nice classic cars and shit
[2017-02-04 21:41:27 UTC] kiyoshi_maeda: I quit n had to watch Phil's playthrough on mafia 3
[2017-02-04 21:41:41 UTC] bethe2670: yeah gino once the story dlc comes out i'll be downloaded all the updates and the game again and all the dlcs lol
[2017-02-04 21:41:41 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Combat was decently hard hitting too
[2017-02-04 21:41:54 UTC] bethe2670: then ill be rusty as fuck :D
[2017-02-04 21:41:58 UTC] bethe2670: and die a lot

[2017-02-04 21:42:57 UTC] vince329: @kg12228 it's really fun to play. Side content is enjoyable to experience, but maybe not for a viewing audience
[2017-02-04 21:43:02 UTC] vince329: story is really great though (Y)
[2017-02-04 21:43:06 UTC] vince329: (thumbs up)
[2017-02-04 21:43:10 UTC] ginosaji48: i like the fact that story dlcs will be accesible in normal story mode and not separatedly

[2017-02-04 21:45:07 UTC] bethe2670: donovan?
[2017-02-04 21:45:16 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Mafia 3's problems were stealth was more pushed then just all out combat(Thats just my personal objection), keeping everyone happy to keep your perks you earned, losing them if you didn't, and the whole racket/district monotony was way too much
[2017-02-04 21:45:18 UTC] ginosaji48: Faster Baby
[2017-02-04 21:45:21 UTC] 0megaj0ker: is she someones kid I guess?

[2017-02-04 21:45:51 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The AI I actually enjoyed due to the fact I could run in and just take people out and run through like a warrior
[2017-02-04 21:45:58 UTC] bethe2670: oh ok gino
[2017-02-04 21:46:18 UTC] encelor: oh lord

[2017-02-04 21:48:50 UTC] phoenixrising2015: In fantasy gaming, I would actually like a Magnificent Seven Game. It could have prequel chapters for each member, and you could actually keep everyone alive in non canon
[2017-02-04 21:48:51 UTC] yacherdy: I remember lol
[2017-02-04 21:48:53 UTC] flyingminister: I hope he kills her

[2017-02-04 21:52:14 UTC] iconicmaster1: Yeah that him
[2017-02-04 21:52:19 UTC] silverizpro2: True @Vince329

[2017-02-04 21:52:20 UTC] vince329: and when you sell, there's an extra chance to get something in return like an elixer or bomb

[2017-02-04 21:52:31 UTC] focusdakid: he does a little bit. And the suit too
[2017-02-04 21:52:46 UTC] yacherdy: this game shall never end!
[2017-02-04 21:52:54 UTC] kg12228: @vince329 I did but you end up 15 mins in the menu selling 50 items for a small amount of points.
[2017-02-04 21:53:08 UTC] akioartorius: I guess it bad if I forgot this was Kiryu's friend
[2017-02-04 21:53:09 UTC] somone192: The money island will take forever but will help with upgrades
[2017-02-04 21:53:12 UTC] kg12228: esp if you had armor or weapon blessing on
[2017-02-04 21:53:14 UTC] silverizpro2: @bethe2670 they each get two chapters and switch
[2017-02-04 21:53:19 UTC] akioartorius: yes
[2017-02-04 21:53:25 UTC] iconicmaster1: When the twisted metal is going to come out
[2017-02-04 21:53:34 UTC] bethe2670: 30 hours if you do straight story
[2017-02-04 21:53:44 UTC] bethe2670: 60 hours if you do side shit as well

[2017-02-04 21:54:44 UTC] kg12228: @vince329 yup. I also didn't like the blacksmith in DS you had to grind for armor now in Nioh you just spend points to make any armor look like something else
[2017-02-04 21:55:06 UTC] bethe2670: NotLikeThis
[2017-02-04 21:55:09 UTC] focusdakid: that's good bethe. lol
