[2017-02-17 19:38:33 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bad thing :(
[2017-02-17 19:38:44 UTC] yacherdy: Sorry jimbob :(

[2017-02-17 19:40:56 UTC] yacherdy: 2007 was the year I went to Coachella and Mass Effect 1 came out...15 years old...damn
[2017-02-17 19:41:10 UTC] podusmonens: gino, you're lucky, phil can't afford going to the doctor
[2017-02-17 19:41:16 UTC] yacherdy: I was Derich's age lol
[2017-02-17 19:41:28 UTC] bethe2670: gino probably has free health care or no?
[2017-02-17 19:41:35 UTC] tehbreezy1: Are you okay Gino?
[2017-02-17 19:41:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: There's no need to worry about the Scarface montage Gino just hope you have a speedy recovery
[2017-02-17 19:42:00 UTC] podusmonens: leave TIHYDP to the trolls

[2017-02-17 19:42:54 UTC] bethe2670: what game do you like dragin lol
[2017-02-17 19:43:03 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I don't get the misconception that 'detractors' don't like the KOGaming TIHYDPs cos they're on his channel. Truth of the matter is simple, there's some TIHYDPs that aren't that good, sometimes cos of editing and sometimes cos it's not a good playthrough to make a TIHYDP for.
[2017-02-17 19:43:04 UTC] yacherdy: I chose magic and got rid of strength....I'm sure that's wrong somehow lol
[2017-02-17 19:43:11 UTC] kingjadvcmp: it's not as black and white as 'oh it's on this channel so they hate it'
[2017-02-17 19:43:28 UTC] podusmonens: right, I don't like mafia and KH so i must hate games in general
[2017-02-17 19:43:42 UTC] podusmonens: haaaaaaderp
[2017-02-17 19:43:43 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I didn't like the deadpool intro myself KingjadVCMP and the memes felt a bit too much at times imo
[2017-02-17 19:43:56 UTC] bethe2670: yacherdy i usually pick strength and magic
[2017-02-17 19:43:58 UTC] bethe2670: lol
[2017-02-17 19:43:59 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I did watch it and felt it was a bit cringe, people have their own styles
[2017-02-17 19:44:08 UTC] yacherdy: The thing about TIHYDP is...I'm gonna use a Phil word here, it became a FAD so now YouTube is overpopulated and the quality has gotten worse
[2017-02-17 19:44:25 UTC] yacherdy: @bethe2670 well I hope magic and defense is good enough because I'm stuck with lawl
[2017-02-17 19:44:28 UTC] podusmonens: quality content
[2017-02-17 19:44:38 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I thought he was gonna take off the deadpool mask at the end of the video and say "it was me Phil,it was me all along" but alas he didn't
[2017-02-17 19:44:41 UTC] kingjadvcmp: there's still good ones out there, in fact there are some gaining tens of thousands of views made this year - and some are about other YouTubers too
[2017-02-17 19:45:06 UTC] bethe2670: lol jimbob
[2017-02-17 19:46:19 UTC] yacherdy: jimbob Kappa
[2017-02-17 19:46:32 UTC] bethe2670: yachedy well it better be you got the sonald duck class
[2017-02-17 19:46:39 UTC] bethe2670: donald*
[2017-02-17 19:46:41 UTC] kingjadvcmp: have never made a TIHYDP but vast editing experience elsewhere, I feel the biggest priority is the kahntent itself - was the playthrough able to produce moments that made the viewer react in a specific manner. That makes the editing part easy in a way, if you have good stuff to work with.
[2017-02-17 19:46:53 UTC] yacherdy: so donald is magic and defense?
[2017-02-17 19:46:55 UTC] kingjadvcmp: if Phil stays calm and plays fairly competently for the most part, it won't make a good TIHYDP
[2017-02-17 19:47:08 UTC] yacherdy: Am I the only one who wants to go to a bar and get drunk with Goofy?
[2017-02-17 19:47:13 UTC] bethe2670: yacherdy yes goofy is the strength one
[2017-02-17 19:47:19 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Goofy would be an awful drunk.
[2017-02-17 19:47:24 UTC] yacherdy: that guy could probably pound em...maybe pick up a few sluts
[2017-02-17 19:47:30 UTC] bethe2670: goofy is already drunk lol

[2017-02-17 21:54:04 UTC] drilbit777: Stances change the flow of the game like high stance giving you more powerful swings in exchange for slower speeds, low stance giving you faster attacks and lower damage. Mid being balanced etc
