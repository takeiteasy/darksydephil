[2017-02-13 19:52:24 UTC] darksydephil: imagine if you relied on the wwe network to work for these shows and it constantly fucked up, and all they did was send you a twitter apology lol
[2017-02-13 19:52:29 UTC] yacherdy: good luck getting big time views reviewing wrestling..would need to have a website accompanied by it
[2017-02-13 19:52:29 UTC] bethe2670: they probably get special privileges
[2017-02-13 19:52:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: they'd probably buy the PPV on cable rather than risk the wwe network
[2017-02-13 19:53:00 UTC] darksydephil: most cable companies dropped the ppvs btw
[2017-02-13 19:53:01 UTC] deltaforce355: you still thinking of making a politic channle?

[2017-02-13 19:54:01 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob Yeah but do they make a living off it? Most people I follow are small timers. A few have a couple thousand subs though.
[2017-02-13 19:54:32 UTC] darksydephil: damn i had the wrong date in the channel info

[2017-02-13 20:00:18 UTC] fensthespook: @DeltaForce355 Well *** used to be a way to dog Phil and make fun of him. No he's using it to promote his channel/vidoes so eventually *** will be assosciated with Phils channel and not the hate vids

[2017-02-13 21:12:57 UTC] encelor: @Neuroblack77 yup
[2017-02-13 21:12:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: need backtracking and padding cahman Team Ninja
[2017-02-13 21:13:03 UTC] yacherdy: Gino can I post booty gifs in chat?
[2017-02-13 21:13:07 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: Lol perfect gesture
[2017-02-13 21:13:15 UTC] bethe2670: the mimic is like copy me does pose and then counts down from 5 lol
[2017-02-13 21:13:18 UTC] ginosaji48: no
[2017-02-13 21:13:19 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Game didn't give me OP BKH cahmaan d00d poorly designed
[2017-02-13 21:13:20 UTC] yacherdy: ok
[2017-02-13 21:13:21 UTC] jmon_1985: Only big booties
[2017-02-13 21:13:25 UTC] encelor: @YaCherdy is it the booty of b2 from nier automata
[2017-02-13 21:13:25 UTC] ginosaji48: :D
[2017-02-13 21:13:32 UTC] theunseenavenger: get to the boss phil!

[2017-02-13 21:13:38 UTC] akioartorius: mujina is impatient and a good liar
[2017-02-13 21:13:38 UTC] yacherdy: if you want
[2017-02-13 21:13:39 UTC] theycallmejimbob: needless* backtracking and padding cahman Team Ninja
[2017-02-13 21:13:40 UTC] honestyrosebud: wow so whiny... time to find another streamer
[2017-02-13 21:13:41 UTC] ginosaji48: or you can pm and i post it for you
[2017-02-13 21:13:44 UTC] dxfreedom: The thing is, the game gives you so many options to deal with enemies. But phil is still 1 stancing with the spear without investing much in skills or messing around with the combo system
[2017-02-13 21:13:45 UTC] thenotoriousclint: those yokai get wrecked. not hard at all.
[2017-02-13 21:13:50 UTC] xgameofpwns: @TheUnseenAvenger Phil's strategy now is out rage opponents an poke them. This boss is mostly range attacks so it might give him problems
[2017-02-13 21:13:51 UTC] bethe2670: i dont care for big booties if they fake
[2017-02-13 21:13:58 UTC] neuroblack77: @DXFreeDoM The items are extremely helpful too
[2017-02-13 21:14:03 UTC] encelor: @YaCherdy you dunno B2 from nier automata? its the white hair chick
[2017-02-13 21:14:04 UTC] akioartorius: Phil use your other stances and your dual katanas
[2017-02-13 21:14:04 UTC] shotinthedeep: yep gino likes posting that kinda stuff
[2017-02-13 21:14:06 UTC] bethe2670: cause that shit too obvious
[2017-02-13 21:14:10 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Rosebud, yea, time for you to fuck off TriHard
[2017-02-13 21:14:11 UTC] taurusoxford: @DXFreeDoM he should really be using his dual katanas more - it's a better option for smaller enemies
[2017-02-13 21:14:12 UTC] dxfreedom: he plays it like darksouls and he misses out on so many cool and indepth stuff this game has to offer
[2017-02-13 21:14:15 UTC] shotinthedeep: with a rick roll mixed in
[2017-02-13 21:14:18 UTC] vendatus: just rush towards the boss like Dan did Kappa
[2017-02-13 21:14:20 UTC] bethe2670: its like titties cant have fake ones lol
[2017-02-13 21:14:21 UTC] thenotoriousclint: phil. midstance spear all game. no combos, terrible ki pulse, no items, no stance change combos
[2017-02-13 21:14:21 UTC] xgameofpwns: @akioartorius NEVER EVER EVER
[2017-02-13 21:14:23 UTC] inthedarkarcade: Phil seems really hacked off :(
[2017-02-13 21:14:26 UTC] yacherdy: @Ginosaji48 Nah its okay thank you bb
[2017-02-13 21:14:28 UTC] theunseenavenger: @xgameofpwns I agree. I started with a spear build and it's mind-numbing in my opinion. katana has been much more fun since I switched and I can dodge attacks easier
[2017-02-13 21:14:30 UTC] jmon_1985: Yeah Khloé Kardashian butt look terrible
[2017-02-13 21:14:36 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :( this is starting to sound like the game that shall not be named
[2017-02-13 21:14:37 UTC] yacherdy: yeah fake asses are bad
[2017-02-13 21:14:39 UTC] yacherdy: they make me mad
[2017-02-13 21:14:42 UTC] bbt_2017: phil is In a very bad mood today hating on every little thing now lol
[2017-02-13 21:14:44 UTC] mfd4419: Take ur time and stop maoning and bit hing
[2017-02-13 21:14:44 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hope Phil can sell his balls in this game :(
[2017-02-13 21:14:47 UTC] theunseenavenger: @xgameofpwns I think this game is more fun if you play fast paced
[2017-02-13 21:14:48 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob SCARFACE
[2017-02-13 21:14:51 UTC] mfd4419: Bitching
[2017-02-13 21:14:56 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: game itself must force the player to use variety
[2017-02-13 21:14:59 UTC] encelor: them fake asses cost more than real asses Kappa
[2017-02-13 21:15:02 UTC] dxfreedom: like the spear in low stance has a move that flips you over the enemy and cool stuff like that. But he isnt using any of that.
[2017-02-13 21:15:02 UTC] mfd4419: Moaning
[2017-02-13 21:15:02 UTC] bethe2670: bobbi TIHYDP :D

[2017-02-13 21:15:15 UTC] yacherdy: @encelor oh I just looked her up...nice...stockings
[2017-02-13 21:15:22 UTC] dxfreedom: dual katana are also really cool
[2017-02-13 21:15:28 UTC] kelsper: out of stamina "I can't move"
[2017-02-13 21:15:31 UTC] bethe2670: you saw it bobbi
[2017-02-13 21:15:33 UTC] theunseenavenger: lol
[2017-02-13 21:15:37 UTC] xgameofpwns: @TheUnseenAvenger oh absolutely and it's a shame because the spear is the most combo heavy weapon but he'll never try them
[2017-02-13 21:15:40 UTC] yacherdy: Do girls fart?
[2017-02-13 21:15:41 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob i dont make you mad liar

[2017-02-13 23:57:10 UTC] mag1cal_man: traditionally samurai used pole weapons and the katana was just a back up weapon. *weebs get triggered*

[2017-02-13 23:58:13 UTC] jesussaltchrist: mr_vidar_viking ayyyy me too
[2017-02-13 23:58:37 UTC] yacherdy: Did you say "stay ballsy"?
[2017-02-13 23:58:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: gottem
[2017-02-13 23:58:54 UTC] popsicolo: I don't remember. I did say "I would like some balls" though
[2017-02-13 23:58:55 UTC] zombietron_exe: here we go MingLee
[2017-02-13 23:58:56 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: He had a small amount of ki
[2017-02-13 23:58:59 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: the katana is also very thin, it breaks easy and is bad when a person is wearing armour
[2017-02-13 23:58:59 UTC] bammbino: yoki doesnt have stamina lol
[2017-02-13 23:59:00 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Difference between reasonable and unreasonable ass hole.

[2017-02-13 23:59:05 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: I could see it
[2017-02-13 23:59:08 UTC] theycallmejimbob: this is the one this is the one we've been waiting for
[2017-02-13 23:59:11 UTC] xgameofpwns: is it just me or is Phil complaining more on this game than a dark souls game?
[2017-02-13 23:59:12 UTC] bethe2670: which i dont mean to do
[2017-02-13 23:59:14 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I miss the time when Phil had a good relationship with John Rambo. Made all his co-ops great
[2017-02-13 23:59:19 UTC] jesussaltchrist: makes it's own rules ... what are these rules exactly? OMGScoots
[2017-02-13 23:59:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hmmm bethe2670

[2017-02-13 23:59:32 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no praise like self praise I guess
[2017-02-13 23:59:37 UTC] encelor: @Xgameofpwns he kinda is because he finds the content becoming repetitive
[2017-02-13 23:59:41 UTC] mag1cal_man: @jesussaltchrist that phil can't play for shit
[2017-02-13 23:59:43 UTC] barbaro497: Katana was a backup weapon not a main weapon for samurai
[2017-02-13 23:59:44 UTC] bammbino: @Xgameofpwns, alot more, but its his own fault for not reading things from menus and help options
[2017-02-13 23:59:47 UTC] zombietron_exe: @jesussaltchrist, rules that don't exist so he has en excuse OpieOP
[2017-02-13 23:59:52 UTC] fuzzyblumpkinz: I was never a john rambo fan, but id rather him than panda lee for co ops
[2017-02-13 23:59:53 UTC] bethe2670: im just telling it how it is jimbob
[2017-02-13 23:59:56 UTC] royal_phalanx91: he never changes stance either
