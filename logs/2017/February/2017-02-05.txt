[2017-02-05 21:37:14 UTC] phillymann: I'm wounded with SFV. The combo system is far too stagnant for a street fighter game, they've gone backwards

[2017-02-05 21:37:34 UTC] bethe2670: i mean i wouldnt get bored if i know who phil is and was whipping his ass LIVE on stream
[2017-02-05 21:37:38 UTC] iconicmaster1: How many wins the dude got

[2017-02-05 21:37:48 UTC] eclair66: About 5 or 6.
[2017-02-05 21:37:48 UTC] shindigpsc: You know what I'd like? An unranked mode where you can opt-in to see each other's inputs.
[2017-02-05 21:37:50 UTC] bobbi_ling: who cares about content in a fighter. all you need is online and training mode
[2017-02-05 21:38:00 UTC] bethe2670: this dude has won lik 6-7 times
[2017-02-05 21:38:02 UTC] xthewrath93x: @iconicmaster1, its like 10-0 to the other guy lol

[2017-02-05 21:38:37 UTC] yacherdy: this is like the Warriors playing the Nets
[2017-02-05 21:38:40 UTC] bethe2670: bobbi street fighter only had that on their release and it was shit
[2017-02-05 21:38:42 UTC] factorz26: @Bobbi_Ling I also play offline sometimes
[2017-02-05 21:38:43 UTC] hapticbabyman: OTOH, it's prob fair to say SFV has a much better fighting engine than Injustice 2. That goes without saying
[2017-02-05 21:38:59 UTC] toast_king_john: does it have input delay
[2017-02-05 21:39:06 UTC] liar_ahead: Red_king 5000 is like "Holy crap this guy's a masochist."
[2017-02-05 21:39:12 UTC] weirdbutt: depends on whether you prefer combos or juggles
[2017-02-05 21:39:20 UTC] hapticbabyman: But besides that, it came out at the wrong time; they should've waited until at least more modes and maybe 2-4 more chars were finished
[2017-02-05 21:39:26 UTC] ginosaji48: phil you're not John Cena comon man
[2017-02-05 21:39:27 UTC] shindigpsc: It would be fair if both opted in @eclair66.
[2017-02-05 21:39:29 UTC] iconicmaster1: I wonder there a win 10 match in a row achievement
[2017-02-05 21:39:32 UTC] kingjadvcmp: so Phil has fought this same person at least half a dozen times, and hasn't won once?
[2017-02-05 21:39:33 UTC] vendatus: SFV was Crapcoms worst selling game Kappa
[2017-02-05 21:39:35 UTC] kinggoken: lol John cena
[2017-02-05 21:39:38 UTC] easton_taylor1: @darksydephil you can you Superman ability during combo pressure or mid combo
[2017-02-05 21:39:46 UTC] yacherdy: bodied
[2017-02-05 21:39:48 UTC] chaosmiku: win 10 matches in a row chieves are annoying
[2017-02-05 21:39:49 UTC] hapticbabyman: It would've helped a LOT if it had Cinematic Mode, an actual Arcade mode and the trails at launch
[2017-02-05 21:39:55 UTC] bethe2670: AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA
[2017-02-05 21:39:56 UTC] 0megaj0ker: right in the dick
[2017-02-05 21:39:58 UTC] pluralmite: @bobbi_ling I was saying that for the casuals . I could also care less if this game launched without a story . But nrs likes to cater to the casuals which is why their games sell so well compared to other fighting games

[2017-02-05 21:43:51 UTC] ginosaji48: this guy is getting heated up on phil
[2017-02-05 21:43:52 UTC] pluralmite: I consider fighting games kinda like paying for time as you will struggle down the line if you wait a year later to get all the dlc. You will literally be a year behind everyone else and it will be harder to get good by play online. But if you don't care about that than waiting for a complete edition for the game is completely understandable
[2017-02-05 21:44:00 UTC] phillymann: @eazel the xb1 is with DX12. It has true cloth physics they stated.

[2017-02-05 21:45:19 UTC] eclair66: He won't learn anything by getting bodied over and over again.
[2017-02-05 21:45:20 UTC] pluralmite: @eclair66 you would still be behind in matchup knowledge and experience
[2017-02-05 21:45:21 UTC] tigerpowered: forward x and u can enhance it

[2017-02-05 22:36:50 UTC] caldria29: does anyone know if this game's combat style is more like SFV or mortal kombat (like the moving back to block instead of a block button seems more SFV, but how are the combos, are they more hit confirm based like SFV or more predialed like MK?)

[2017-02-05 22:47:45 UTC] shadowbane1992: mangod112 There's no joy in playing a fighting game where all the other person knows how to do is a single combo, it's not about if you can't block it or not, playing someone who's like that has no fun nor is it challenging.

[2017-02-05 22:48:32 UTC] dweebenheimer20: @Shadowbane1992 theres plenty of people that dont do that, and if you cant figure out someone using the same combo, you just need to get better at the game
