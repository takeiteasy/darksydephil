[2017-02-01 00:00:37 UTC] astralabstraction: that's what I'm saying though. Why play RE7 in VR off stream and play Yakuza 0, a niche game, on stream?

[2017-02-01 20:09:14 UTC] blue_blur64: Per month would've killed me lol
[2017-02-01 20:09:15 UTC] shotinthedeep: good times
[2017-02-01 20:09:18 UTC] bethe2670: someone needs a tag team division
[2017-02-01 20:09:24 UTC] bethe2670: and a womens division
[2017-02-01 20:09:31 UTC] bethe2670: and i guess that is smackdown
[2017-02-01 20:09:32 UTC] yacherdy: You get online for free on PC Kappa
[2017-02-01 20:09:43 UTC] blue_blur64: But now it's only PC Kappa
[2017-02-01 20:09:51 UTC] snakie109: When ps3 switched is when I switched to xbox
[2017-02-01 20:09:55 UTC] shotinthedeep: Well pc games usually have their own servers
[2017-02-01 20:10:09 UTC] shotinthedeep: Well you've always had to pay for xbox
[2017-02-01 20:10:13 UTC] fensthespook: Whoa you have to pay for online for PS3 now?
[2017-02-01 20:10:17 UTC] snakie109: True but they are honest

[2017-02-01 20:10:47 UTC] blue_blur64: They also have a Superbowl commercial
[2017-02-01 20:10:54 UTC] fensthespook: even on PS3 tho? I knew that was on PS4 but they went backward and made PS3 have that pay feature as well?
[2017-02-01 20:10:58 UTC] deltaforce355: still the same for paying to play online bethe
[2017-02-01 20:11:03 UTC] ginosaji48: now i wonder why Bryan and Shane suck at picking "talents" - gays breeze and fandango, ascension, american alpha, zack ryder and the other dumbass and more tag teams, give me a break
[2017-02-01 20:11:12 UTC] shotinthedeep: Yeah, at least you get special deals with ps plus, so that is kinda cool
[2017-02-01 20:11:28 UTC] snakie109: Most people bought the ps3 over the xbox because it was free to play online
[2017-02-01 20:11:28 UTC] bethe2670: gino i said someone needs a tag division
[2017-02-01 20:11:38 UTC] bethe2670: and smackdown is that place
[2017-02-01 20:11:48 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh, and I guess this is kind of historic that the White House actually took a question from Skype Kappa
[2017-02-01 20:11:52 UTC] bethe2670: zack ryder is injured anyway
[2017-02-01 20:12:14 UTC] shotinthedeep: They did silent?

[2017-02-01 23:05:34 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Easton, it wouldn't make sense to play 2.8. The prologue (which is the collection's main bread and butter), takes place right after birth by sleep. Without playing birth by sleep, Phil won't know what in the hell's going on.
[2017-02-01 23:05:36 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Even when he was at EVO East? :D
[2017-02-01 23:05:38 UTC] encelor: ooh nvm
