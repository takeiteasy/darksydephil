[2017-05-26 20:12:07 UTC] daviddedavidson: Maybe the game got more hype then the devs predicted and blam too many people
[2017-05-26 20:12:16 UTC] amineo2: @DarksydePhil Hey, I think you should continue your Nier Automata playthrough, you didn't finish it if I recall correctly and you seemed to enjoy the game
[2017-05-26 20:12:17 UTC] dinohans: he could play some indie games on steam, they are cheap
[2017-05-26 20:12:21 UTC] agoodrpg: Hitman Blood Money please
[2017-05-26 20:12:41 UTC] philtheboss2367: Hitman is a dead series

[2017-05-26 20:12:42 UTC] bobbyhill_187: why was overwatch an option if you had no desire to play it? thats kind of giving fans false info

[2017-05-26 20:13:12 UTC] berniemac_: The fact is, Launch day is like school ending and everyone flooding the 4 foot wide hallway. Doesn't make sense expanding because they hype will die down fast.

[2017-05-26 20:15:06 UTC] jeffwadsworth: Yeah, the devs should have known better. This is unacceptable.
[2017-05-26 20:15:08 UTC] dspfandood: le neogaf boogeyman. Gtfo back to 4chan Stuart
[2017-05-26 20:15:09 UTC] cesar_istheman: If it works later tonight...
[2017-05-26 20:15:15 UTC] berniemac_: Fact is, people will sit on their ass trying to get into a not working game, making the game not work for even longer.
[2017-05-26 20:15:17 UTC] bobbyhill_187: he back

[2017-05-26 20:16:00 UTC] stoemp2: @Deep_Drive btw thanks for letting me know :)
[2017-05-26 20:16:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Trust me, guys. Ft13th is not that good from what i've seen of it. It looks like a beta game, and you have a 20 minute timer in the game, and if you can just camp out somewhere, Jason can't find you and you can win via time over
[2017-05-26 20:16:05 UTC] thirdeyethethird: also most devs don't deserve to be shat on. it's a lot of work to put together a game. it's not like flipping a burger and picking your nose

[2017-05-26 20:16:37 UTC] goldencolts: prove me wrong protip you cant
[2017-05-26 20:16:44 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I was looking forward to it but knew it may die fast. I watched it today and its not what I would hope for

[2017-05-26 20:17:44 UTC] berniemac_: Honestly the single player of F13 would suck anyway IMO, all about the MP
[2017-05-26 20:17:45 UTC] deep_drive: It's best to wait some time till the servers are more stable anyways
[2017-05-26 20:18:07 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Thats the Watchtower, I think @A_lern
[2017-05-26 20:18:23 UTC] berniemac_: @Deep_Drive Yup, if everyone had that mindset the servers would be stable in no time. Everyone flooding the already hurt servers just breaks things even further.

[2017-05-26 20:19:50 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I hope RDR2 lets you dual aim with guns to clear rooms

[2017-05-26 22:31:08 UTC] stuart360: Not really, it depends on the game. His Dark Souls streams always get big attendance
[2017-05-26 22:31:10 UTC] kushiyakitori: @Johnrunrun night streams have the least amount of people and that usually runs at 200 to 300 some
[2017-05-26 22:31:13 UTC] osumania123: phil can be good if he really wants to
[2017-05-26 22:31:19 UTC] dspisfeelinsalty: how can you give this a 8.5 when its exactly the same as injustice 1
[2017-05-26 22:31:26 UTC] johnrunrun: probably 200 bots then, my guess
[2017-05-26 22:31:26 UTC] kushiyakitori: @Johnrunrun more popular games raise the lower limits though
