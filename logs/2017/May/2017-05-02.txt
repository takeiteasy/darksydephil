[2017-05-02 17:30:36 UTC] kingjadvcmp: sounds pretty bad, you might wanna give it a quick look
[2017-05-02 17:31:28 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil must of walked under a ladder with regard to youtube
[2017-05-02 17:32:45 UTC] kingjadvcmp: least there's twitch. Just needs to keep growing. Quite a few folk make a living from Twitch, and he's really embraced it so he just needs to keep working hard at it, trying to push himself to a bigger audience.
[2017-05-02 17:33:47 UTC] grim_blades: could venture out to Vid.me
[2017-05-02 17:34:10 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I'm not sure if Phil mis-spoke though in the video - he did literally say it was costing him hundreds of dollars per day, YouTube monetizing being how it currently is. But he later said this wasn't the case - slip of the tongue?
[2017-05-02 17:36:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I wonder when they launched the new authorization method given he didn't run into any trouble joining Curse

[2017-05-02 17:37:18 UTC] anondublo1: @KingjadVCMP I don't put any thought into whatsoever. He's going to make another video in two weeks anyway.
[2017-05-02 17:38:34 UTC] kingjadvcmp: so do you not listen or care about those vlogs? You cheered and subbed, so I assume you care to an extent lol
[2017-05-02 17:40:04 UTC] anondublo1: I watch them for their comedic value.
[2017-05-02 17:40:55 UTC] anondublo1: But no, I really don't care. Again, he's gonna make another video in like a month. Saying the same shit he says literally every day in pre-stream.
[2017-05-02 17:41:22 UTC] theycallmejimbob: So does anyone know anything about this new Nioh DLC?
[2017-05-02 17:42:00 UTC] kingjadvcmp: not a thing. That's quite savage anon, each to their own I guess
[2017-05-02 17:42:51 UTC] anondublo1: Eventually you get tired of hearing the shit. I've got problem of my own too. Handle that shit.

You are struggling just now but you're risking sounding a bit ungrateful because it's not as much as you hoped it would be. The fact your fans can give you over $1000 on Patreon and whatever else Twitch provides, quite a lot are giving a lot as is. There is only so much they can regularly give you.

[2017-05-02 23:24:27 UTC] annihilattorr: his stream is anjoyable
[2017-05-02 23:24:30 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeah but the haters want to make it sound like it was all DSP's fault LOOL
[2017-05-02 23:24:32 UTC] annihilattorr: enjoyable
[2017-05-02 23:24:34 UTC] skyfx89: I don't think so much hate comes from nothing, so much shit has accumulated over time, its no wonder, I understand the haters
[2017-05-02 23:24:53 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I think it is more jealousy than anything else
[2017-05-02 23:25:03 UTC] loocina: Jealous of what
[2017-05-02 23:25:05 UTC] annihilattorr: how the heck there are 571 watching and only 5 typing
[2017-05-02 23:25:08 UTC] leokira997: jealousy of what?
[2017-05-02 23:25:11 UTC] loocina: pimping retards?
[2017-05-02 23:25:18 UTC] skyfx89: Jealousy? Hes poor, if you believe him
[2017-05-02 23:25:18 UTC] sanguinenite: jealous of how he can make a living without being not themselves
[2017-05-02 23:25:25 UTC] loocina: that's not really praise worthy
[2017-05-02 23:25:34 UTC] leokira997: he has to make videos begging for money constantly and is in a lot of debt what is there to be jealous of?
[2017-05-02 23:25:48 UTC] sanguinenite: lol so do other streamers do the same shit
[2017-05-02 23:25:56 UTC] leokira997: no
[2017-05-02 23:26:04 UTC] sanguinenite: so why haters use it as an argument to get on his case is beyond logical comprehension
[2017-05-02 23:26:11 UTC] skyfx89: Hes poor, infamous, a liar, and the list goes on. Sorry, I want to keep my dignity
[2017-05-02 23:26:33 UTC] sanguinenite: I am sure that DSP is not the only one that asks for donations or subs
[2017-05-02 23:26:44 UTC] leokira997: point me to a streamer that does what phil does
[2017-05-02 23:26:48 UTC] annihilattorr: everyone a liar
[2017-05-02 23:26:52 UTC] annihilattorr: at any given time
[2017-05-02 23:27:06 UTC] sanguinenite: definitely not on twitch, twitch is full of e-beggers but haters wants to make it sound like DSP did it the most or was the biggest liar of all time
[2017-05-02 23:27:08 UTC] sanguinenite: LOL
[2017-05-02 23:27:14 UTC] sanguinenite: Everyone's a sinner
[2017-05-02 23:27:36 UTC] annihilattorr: magnitude is different but yea everyone does it
[2017-05-02 23:27:41 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @sanguinenite It doesn't help that DSP used to shit on twitch streamers for being "e-beggers"
[2017-05-02 23:27:42 UTC] beanie5181: Phil never pretended to be crippled for donations like some streamers
[2017-05-02 23:27:43 UTC] sanguinenite: The double standards of sinners is amazing
[2017-05-02 23:27:47 UTC] ufccurbstomp: only to become one himself
[2017-05-02 23:27:55 UTC] leokira997: again point me to a streamer that does what phil does
[2017-05-02 23:28:02 UTC] beanie5181: Like in a wheelchair
[2017-05-02 23:28:15 UTC] annihilattorr: he is in a wheel chair?
[2017-05-02 23:28:15 UTC] sanguinenite: That is one point that I will agree with the haters is that phil badmouthed the practices that he eventually came to do
[2017-05-02 23:28:18 UTC] leokira997: zillianop was retarded
[2017-05-02 23:28:23 UTC] annihilattorr: I'm pretty new I don't know about him
[2017-05-02 23:28:45 UTC] skyfx89: Begging is one thing, throwing that money he couldnt pay his bills for to holidays in his own state is kinda throwing shit on his donators, and if you can afford a vacation, then it was obviously a lie that hes in dire help
[2017-05-02 23:29:03 UTC] spitzer_mcmlxii: Why was it Rambos fault for the falling out between them?
[2017-05-02 23:29:12 UTC] beanie5181: I would probably donate more if he didn't have 2 mortages considering I have 0
[2017-05-02 23:29:18 UTC] loocina: I guess being upfront about needing bills paid, plus fast food expenses and vacations makes him more amiable and earnest than the twitch people
[2017-05-02 23:29:49 UTC] sanguinenite: Rambo was not clear about the terms and apparent said word for word "Oh we are not doing P7 for money, we just wanted attention for our channels"
[2017-05-02 23:29:53 UTC] loocina: normie twitch streamers anyway
[2017-05-02 23:29:55 UTC] sanguinenite: Phil even offered money
[2017-05-02 23:30:01 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @skyfx89 I don't think he even lied about his monetary situation when he took that staycation - I think he foolishly assumed that KOGaming was gonna explode so he thought he could easily afford to waste money again
[2017-05-02 23:30:08 UTC] sanguinenite: when he was hashing out the terms and conditions of P7.
[2017-05-02 23:30:10 UTC] mikejdipietro: remember when phil jerked off his baby dick on stream lol
[2017-05-02 23:30:51 UTC] sanguinenite: Rambo should have been more explicit saying "If we dont get the attention that we think we should get, then we want monetary compensation" Phil would have been okay with it if they had been transparent
[2017-05-02 23:31:02 UTC] sanguinenite: So haters trying to get on Phil's case is Bullshit
[2017-05-02 23:31:21 UTC] skyfx89: @ufccurbstomp Only thing that exploded was his little dignity that was left
[2017-05-02 23:32:12 UTC] skyfx89: Getting a fair cut is kinda obvious from the start when you start a group project
[2017-05-02 23:32:45 UTC] spitzer_mcmlxii: Okay thanks for the answer
[2017-05-02 23:32:50 UTC] loocina: what about when he locked the rest of crash 2 behind a paywall when it was lucrative from get go?
[2017-05-02 23:33:10 UTC] loocina: was that extra avenue really pertinent
[2017-05-02 23:33:19 UTC] sanguinenite: Is crash 2 still behind a paywall now?
[2017-05-02 23:33:31 UTC] ufccurbstomp: No, because he finished it
[2017-05-02 23:33:33 UTC] leokira997: wheres persona 3
[2017-05-02 23:33:53 UTC] sanguinenite: He only said he would play a patreon choice game, HE NEVER promised to finish it
[2017-05-02 23:33:53 UTC] loocina: exactly, bringing up his atrocities is a sensitive subject
[2017-05-02 23:34:10 UTC] loocina: especially for misguided stalwarts
[2017-05-02 23:34:21 UTC] loocina: he never promises anything does he?
[2017-05-02 23:34:22 UTC] sanguinenite: And P3 final boss is a piece of garbage unless you like torturing yourself like the Japanese
[2017-05-02 23:34:24 UTC] leokira997: isnt it called patrons choice playthrough?
[2017-05-02 23:34:29 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @sanguinenite when people pay you to play a game, they are expecting it to be a full playthrough
[2017-05-02 23:34:31 UTC] loocina: ^
[2017-05-02 23:34:36 UTC] loocina: ^^^
[2017-05-02 23:34:47 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeah he does play the game, but he never said " I will FINISH a game of patreon's choosing"
[2017-05-02 23:34:55 UTC] leokira997: >playthrough
[2017-05-02 23:35:05 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Playthrough implies you PLAY IT THROUGH
[2017-05-02 23:35:12 UTC] ufccurbstomp: not play it till you get tired
[2017-05-02 23:35:29 UTC] sanguinenite: Get me a screen shot off from the Patreon page of DSP can show me the word "finish"
[2017-05-02 23:35:37 UTC] sanguinenite: or synonyms of finish
[2017-05-02 23:35:40 UTC] leokira997: a playthrough
[2017-05-02 23:35:45 UTC] ufccurbstomp: PLAYTHROUGH
[2017-05-02 23:35:45 UTC] loocina: playthrough
[2017-05-02 23:35:48 UTC] loocina: LOL
[2017-05-02 23:35:57 UTC] leokira997: go to his patreon and check read the goal
[2017-05-02 23:36:10 UTC] sanguinenite: playthrough just means playing a game and uploading it, does not imply that it must be completed from beginning to end
[2017-05-02 23:36:22 UTC] leokira997: April 2017's Patreon goal is the next Patrons' Choice playthrough! If you pledge $5 or more during April, and we hit the funding goal, you'll be able to nominate/vote on a game for me to create a FULL playthrough for, guaranteed!
[2017-05-02 23:36:25 UTC] sanguinenite: But haters want to play semantis
[2017-05-02 23:36:33 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Playthough means you play it through - as in the whole game
[2017-05-02 23:36:34 UTC] leokira997: boom bitch
[2017-05-02 23:36:40 UTC] loocina: semantics is a stretch
[2017-05-02 23:36:48 UTC] loocina: it's common sense
[2017-05-02 23:37:16 UTC] xstarfixx: by that logic, if you do a playthrough of skyrim, you have to play the whole thing without taking a break?
[2017-05-02 23:37:24 UTC] skyfx89: @sanguinenite So I can put up a patreon wall for a game of choice at $1000 and just play a part of it when he does full playtrhoughs? Is that fair to the donators? All in all, do you think hate over 8 years comes from nothing? Or is it earned? People has been so lenient towards Phil's lies over the time, but he still keeps lying and e-begging and spending that money on crap.
[2017-05-02 23:37:36 UTC] sanguinenite: full playthrough doesnt include an unreasonable boss fight like at the end of P3
[2017-05-02 23:37:37 UTC] loocina: he gets the money, stalls and many times acts retarded about the game and considers that him playing the game
[2017-05-02 23:37:53 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @sanguinenite wow, we're defending ragequits now?
[2017-05-02 23:37:53 UTC] leokira997: its the final boss
[2017-05-02 23:37:54 UTC] fabsgnecco: phil does what suits him
[2017-05-02 23:37:59 UTC] skyfx89: Phil has got too many chances to be famous. now hes infamous thanks to his own mind
[2017-05-02 23:38:05 UTC] leokira997: he aint done with the game
[2017-05-02 23:38:05 UTC] ufccurbstomp: You're clearly beyond help
[2017-05-02 23:38:09 UTC] sanguinenite: Sometimes, ragequits are DESERVED
[2017-05-02 23:38:19 UTC] ufccurbstomp: P3 ragequit wasn't deserved
[2017-05-02 23:38:20 UTC] leokira997: i feel sanguine is a troll
[2017-05-02 23:38:22 UTC] loocina: So this deserved a ragequit because
[2017-05-02 23:38:29 UTC] sanguinenite: unless you say Phil ragequits on 50% of all games he plays then you would have an argument
[2017-05-02 23:38:39 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @sanguinenite he has to be - what Phil fanboy only donates 1 bit?
[2017-05-02 23:38:48 UTC] loocina: ^
[2017-05-02 23:38:59 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I am not a "fanboy" just because I watch his content doesnt make me a fanboy LOL
[2017-05-02 23:39:11 UTC] ufccurbstomp: you are blindly defending him
[2017-05-02 23:39:11 UTC] leokira997: oh dear god
[2017-05-02 23:39:15 UTC] sanguinenite: I like free content on the internet, nothing is going to stop me from watching
[2017-05-02 23:39:21 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Even Vidar doesn't backseat this badly
[2017-05-02 23:39:55 UTC] sanguinenite: Blindly? lol so do the haters, for me it isnt blindly, I have reasons, reasons that haters may or may not accept
[2017-05-02 23:40:01 UTC] leokira997: sanguine i will give you credit on one thing
[2017-05-02 23:40:08 UTC] leokira997: rooSip
[2017-05-02 23:40:24 UTC] charlie_decker: any of ya'll able to watch the archive of this nioh stream?
[2017-05-02 23:40:25 UTC] ufccurbstomp: The "haters" don't hate Phil blindly - they have YEARS of data archived of all the stupid shit he has done
[2017-05-02 23:40:34 UTC] charlie_decker: it's just blank for me when I click the vidya
[2017-05-02 23:40:38 UTC] charlie_decker: wanted to see some belly rage.
[2017-05-02 23:42:11 UTC] skyfx89: @sanguinenite Its true what they said, you Phil fans really are a cult. You will defend his lies and faults to the bone no matter how obvious it is that Phil has fucked over the donators. How gullible can you get?
[2017-05-02 23:42:31 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @Charlie_Decker I don't think he leaves his archives public
[2017-05-02 23:42:34 UTC] sanguinenite: Who are these "donators"? You can be sure I am not one of them LOL
[2017-05-02 23:42:41 UTC] charlie_decker: said he would since he can't upload to jewtube
[2017-05-02 23:42:51 UTC] charlie_decker: didn't he? plus if an archive isn't public wouldn't that make it simply not here?
[2017-05-02 23:43:03 UTC] charlie_decker: i can see the nioh stream archive thing. can click it, but then shits blank.
[2017-05-02 23:43:09 UTC] ufccurbstomp: weird
[2017-05-02 23:43:37 UTC] charlie_decker: heard he died 96 times on a boss i beat in 2 tries. i need to see that shit man
[2017-05-02 23:44:01 UTC] skyfx89: @sanguinenite Donators&fans, you get the point, or don you with purpose maybe
[2017-05-02 23:44:30 UTC] sanguinenite: Well it definitely doesnt apply to me, what then?
[2017-05-02 23:44:41 UTC] ufccurbstomp: You're still a blind defender
[2017-05-02 23:44:52 UTC] sanguinenite: the haters make it sound like all fans of phil are all just handing him money lol
[2017-05-02 23:45:45 UTC] sanguinenite: lol you haters are still blind haters too.
[2017-05-02 23:46:19 UTC] ufccurbstomp: How? We have proof of his horrible attitude and poor business decisions
[2017-05-02 23:46:25 UTC] sanguinenite: Even all the accusations of racism are all taken out of context jokes, the haters are without a leg to stand on
[2017-05-02 23:46:59 UTC] ufccurbstomp: So when he said his fans were lazy because they didn't show up to his Pokemon streams, was that "out of context" too?
[2017-05-02 23:47:23 UTC] sanguinenite: For me, I enjoy making irrational people angry with my logic, it find it amusing how they have no points yet pretend as if they have some kind of legitimate argument
[2017-05-02 23:47:45 UTC] ufccurbstomp: We're making plenty of points - you're just ignoring them all
[2017-05-02 23:48:24 UTC] charlie_decker: "irrational people angry with my logic"in my experience, random people on the internet to often yell about how they love logic, are the ones who often don't actually know anything about how logic works.
[2017-05-02 23:48:32 UTC] leokira997: not really angry just confused how you can keep saying this stuff
[2017-05-02 23:48:45 UTC] sanguinenite: You are making a lot of useless points that are all circumstantial;
[2017-05-02 23:48:59 UTC] sanguinenite: @LeoKira997 confused? about what?
[2017-05-02 23:49:17 UTC] leokira997: >not really angry just confused how you can keep saying this stuff
[2017-05-02 23:49:27 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Yes or No, did Phil call his fans lazy because they didn't show up to his Pokemon stream?
[2017-05-02 23:49:31 UTC] leokira997: thought that was pretty clear
[2017-05-02 23:49:39 UTC] sanguinenite: and since you are a subber, leokira, why are you questioning my arguments that are pro-dsp?
[2017-05-02 23:49:50 UTC] sanguinenite: you sound like a troll yourself XD
[2017-05-02 23:49:52 UTC] vpzneox: how dare u all
[2017-05-02 23:49:53 UTC] leokira997: i aint a sub
[2017-05-02 23:49:59 UTC] ufccurbstomp: That's a twitch prime sub - he paid nothing for that
[2017-05-02 23:50:02 UTC] leokira997: the crown next to me is twitch prime
[2017-05-02 23:50:06 UTC] vpzneox: start without me and popcorn
[2017-05-02 23:50:13 UTC] sanguinenite: for which streamer?
[2017-05-02 23:50:23 UTC] leokira997: a diablo streamer
[2017-05-02 23:50:32 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Pretty sure Phil gets no money for that Twitch Prime sub either
[2017-05-02 23:50:39 UTC] sanguinenite: Then why are you here XD
[2017-05-02 23:50:40 UTC] leokira997: he does
[2017-05-02 23:50:46 UTC] charlie_decker: i like how you talked about how good your logic is, then assumed that if Leokira is a sub to DSP, they must support any argument that is pro-dsp
[2017-05-02 23:50:51 UTC] charlie_decker: good reasoning there
[2017-05-02 23:51:22 UTC] sanguinenite: Goes to show I am not a "fanboy" of anyone, including Phil XD
[2017-05-02 23:51:42 UTC] ufccurbstomp: then why are you defending him? shouldn't you be neutral on both Phil and the SoK?
[2017-05-02 23:51:56 UTC] sanguinenite: But you haters all assumed that I must be donated money to DSP, when I am clearly aint one of them XD
[2017-05-02 23:52:06 UTC] sanguinenite: Good reasoning there, idiots
[2017-05-02 23:52:34 UTC] charlie_decker: you know what my favorite detractor video was?
[2017-05-02 23:52:37 UTC] sanguinenite: I find it funny how SoK roasts Phil , I clicked on their vids before with adblocker
[2017-05-02 23:52:51 UTC] vpzneox: /me spills cola and popcorn around.
[2017-05-02 23:52:51 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Ignore the fucking donations - you're still blindly defending him while shitting on his "haters" with no good reason for either
[2017-05-02 23:52:51 UTC] charlie_decker: long time ago, philbert put up a video where he was yelling about some dumb shit. i don't remember what and he opened his internet tabs
[2017-05-02 23:53:08 UTC] charlie_decker: then some dude took phils video, zoomed in on the tabs, and one of them was just "hot latino girls xxx suck cock"
[2017-05-02 23:53:12 UTC] charlie_decker: i miss that video.
[2017-05-02 23:53:16 UTC] ufccurbstomp: hahahaha
[2017-05-02 23:53:24 UTC] sanguinenite: But then again, they are quite losers themselves for making 1 hour long vlogs about phil XD
[2017-05-02 23:53:38 UTC] ufccurbstomp: That must have been what he was looking at when he jerked off on the Nioh demo
[2017-05-02 23:53:49 UTC] lightweightbro: lol
[2017-05-02 23:54:02 UTC] sanguinenite: I side with no one but my own logic. Sure, Phil is FAR from perfect but for other people like SoK to make 1 hour long vlogs, they must have no life either XD
[2017-05-02 23:54:11 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Your logic makes zero sense
[2017-05-02 23:54:16 UTC] charlie_decker: "i side with no one but my own logic"
[2017-05-02 23:54:20 UTC] charlie_decker: you don't have "your own logic"
[2017-05-02 23:54:22 UTC] sanguinenite: Neither does the haters' logic
[2017-05-02 23:54:24 UTC] charlie_decker: logic is the study of reason
[2017-05-02 23:54:24 UTC] leokira997: they have lives
[2017-05-02 23:54:26 UTC] sanguinenite: so we are even
[2017-05-02 23:54:27 UTC] ufccurbstomp: They do have lives - they work normal jobs
[2017-05-02 23:54:30 UTC] charlie_decker: that's like saying you side with your own history.
[2017-05-02 23:54:46 UTC] leokira997: they do that stuff in their free time
[2017-05-02 23:55:04 UTC] vpzneox: encore! more Bravo!
[2017-05-02 23:55:08 UTC] leokira997: and many of them use to be fans of phil
[2017-05-02 23:55:10 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeah but hearing how excited they were to roast phil, kinda shows how they have no life
[2017-05-02 23:55:22 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Roasting Phil is not a 24/7 task for them, and most of their streams related to Phil take place on the weekends
[2017-05-02 23:55:43 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Everyone enjoys roasting Phil
[2017-05-02 23:55:50 UTC] leokira997: ^
[2017-05-02 23:55:53 UTC] sanguinenite: lol
[2017-05-02 23:56:00 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Slowbeef, super best friends play, the FGC
[2017-05-02 23:56:11 UTC] sanguinenite: You dont see me making 1 hour long videos to shit on someone, ever
[2017-05-02 23:56:27 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Cause no one would watch you
[2017-05-02 23:56:43 UTC] sanguinenite: lol no one would watch SoK either if Phil never existed
[2017-05-02 23:57:12 UTC] leokira997: sok wouldnt exist without phil so technically you are right?
[2017-05-02 23:57:21 UTC] sanguinenite: Like literally, the SoK owe their popularity to the existence of Phil.
[2017-05-02 23:57:30 UTC] ufccurbstomp: So we have no right to criticise Phil because he's the only reason we are here?
[2017-05-02 23:57:45 UTC] philtheboss2367: And Phil owes the Sok for making him relevant
[2017-05-02 23:57:45 UTC] leokira997: maybe, but its not like they are doing this money
[2017-05-02 23:57:50 UTC] sanguinenite: ...like yeah since you are all talentless hacks that need to ride on Phil's name notoriety
[2017-05-02 23:57:53 UTC] leokira997: this for*
[2017-05-02 23:57:55 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @sanguinenite the SoK wouldn't be popular if they shit on Phil for no good reason
[2017-05-02 23:58:08 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Phil has given them EVERY good reason and then some
[2017-05-02 23:58:25 UTC] sanguinenite: Like if you had any real talent, you wouldnt have had to make 1 hour long vlogs about someone else and shit on them just because
[2017-05-02 23:58:52 UTC] charlie_decker: i wish i had real talent....
[2017-05-02 23:59:09 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Their goal was never to become talented content creators - it was to talk about Phil's shitty attitude and actions
[2017-05-02 23:59:22 UTC] sanguinenite: LOL they dont put ads on their videos?
[2017-05-02 23:59:27 UTC] ufccurbstomp: no
[2017-05-02 23:59:34 UTC] leokira997: they dont
[2017-05-02 23:59:58 UTC] sanguinenite: Then why bother with the SoK brand?
