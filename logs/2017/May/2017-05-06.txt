[2017-05-06 01:23:36 UTC] itssoraaa: anyone else here before the stream?
[2017-05-06 01:39:46 UTC] darksydephil: yes, I am
[2017-05-06 01:46:16 UTC] itssoraaa: oh lol hey Phil. How did your dealer situation go? by the way, what kind of car are you looking to get?
[2017-05-06 01:49:10 UTC] darksydephil: the dealer situation went incredibly well. our credit got us a really good promotion and its going to lower our monthly car payment by a minimum of $200 if not more. pretty pleased right now
[2017-05-06 01:49:19 UTC] darksydephil: id rather not talk about the car until we have it though
[2017-05-06 01:51:06 UTC] ornightz: Whoh
[2017-05-06 01:52:02 UTC] grim_blades: Better be American made
[2017-05-06 01:52:26 UTC] itssoraaa: Well that's good. I have to go to the dealers out here in Connecticut when I return from vacation. That promotion sounds incredibly well for a monthly payment. And yeah we understand on the car.
[2017-05-06 01:54:15 UTC] grim_blades: I know I was looking at some cars, and it was actually cheaper to buy a new one. With allt he deals and incentives, compared to a used car on the lot
[2017-05-06 01:56:02 UTC] itssoraaa: Yeah, there's actually pretty good deals when you look around. I would love a monthly payment around $200-$300. Last time I checked was like 2 years ago and my payment was going to be like $700 cause of my credit and being only 20.
[2017-05-06 01:56:39 UTC] shootingstargaming0: Hi itssoraaa
[2017-05-06 01:57:27 UTC] deep_drive: Hopefully you don't have to do tons of repairs on the car...Getting a new car was probably a good choice anyways.
[2017-05-06 01:58:58 UTC] itssoraaa: @shootingstargaming0 hello
[2017-05-06 01:59:38 UTC] itssoraaa: Yeah, especially when the dealer covers repair and maintenance for the first couple of years. Thats the best.
[2017-05-06 01:59:47 UTC] darksydephil: if you can qualify with your credit, the incentives on buying a new car are absolutely insane
[2017-05-06 02:00:04 UTC] darksydephil: 0% financing for 72 months, plus 2 years free maintenance lol. what the holy hell
[2017-05-06 02:00:14 UTC] deep_drive: DAMN thats good
[2017-05-06 02:00:16 UTC] darksydephil: you need at least good credit though
[2017-05-06 02:01:43 UTC] grim_blades: I always tired to get a fixed rate, even if its more at the start. Don't want them jacking the rate up to insane numbers
[2017-05-06 02:02:31 UTC] itssoraaa: @DarksydePhil Do you think it's a good idea for someone to get a credit card while young to try and get their credit up?
[2017-05-06 02:03:07 UTC] kushiyakitori: @itssoraaa if you're paying the bill of every month its good. not having credit is pretty shitty.
[2017-05-06 02:03:25 UTC] deep_drive: Well, trying to get a loan for a house without credit is nearly impossible
[2017-05-06 02:03:29 UTC] kushiyakitori: having someone have you as an authorized user is good too cause it makes it look like you've been using a card for a while
[2017-05-06 02:03:31 UTC] itssoraaa: @KushiYakitori Yeah, I've heard having shitty credit is better than no credit at all.
[2017-05-06 02:04:06 UTC] kushiyakitori: @Deep_Drive absolutely. you have to build credit unless you are ridiculously rich and can somehow manage to get anything paid full in cash. even then some places wont bother
[2017-05-06 02:04:22 UTC] kushiyakitori: @itssoraaa neither is ideal but bad credit is slightly (barely) better than no credit.
[2017-05-06 02:04:40 UTC] darksydephil: no credit is worse than bad credit, this is correct
[2017-05-06 02:04:49 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Hello! KonCha
[2017-05-06 02:04:54 UTC] darksydephil: okay
[2017-05-06 02:04:54 UTC] kushiyakitori: if you decide to get a card, make sure its paid every single month. don't spend more than you can pay. and consider a secure credit card. those are designed to help raise credit
[2017-05-06 02:04:57 UTC] darksydephil: setting up for tonights 2nd stream now
[2017-05-06 02:05:04 UTC] soulrider95: DarksydePhil what make is it?
[2017-05-06 02:05:07 UTC] kushiyakitori: nice. this game is pretty interesting. been waiting to see more :)
[2017-05-06 02:05:31 UTC] itssoraaa: I recently got my first credit card to pay for simple things like: phone bill, light, gas, cable/internet and In a few months my credit has improved a bit.
[2017-05-06 02:05:49 UTC] itssoraaa: Excited to continue on Prey
[2017-05-06 02:06:12 UTC] deep_drive: Well at the very least it is easier to build your credit up from scratch...but without credit the only thing banks will give you is a credit card with very high intrest rates
[2017-05-06 02:06:15 UTC] kushiyakitori: me too. I don't know anything about other games of the same title before this reboot but this seems somewhat interesting to me
[2017-05-06 02:06:33 UTC] deep_drive: then after getting credit you can get better ones
[2017-05-06 02:06:51 UTC] soulrider95: well don't put anything on the credit card if you can't pay it off before the interest kicks in lmao
[2017-05-06 02:07:03 UTC] soulrider95: to build credit
[2017-05-06 02:07:25 UTC] itssoraaa: Yeah, this game has been pretty interesting so far, and the jump scares are pretty spot on
[2017-05-06 02:07:54 UTC] itssoraaa: and yeah, I only put simple things because I know I'll have the money to pay for those for sure.
[2017-05-06 02:08:46 UTC] deep_drive: I'm hoping theres some jump scares for something other than those mimics lol
[2017-05-06 02:08:58 UTC] deep_drive: pretty easy to kill also
[2017-05-06 02:09:05 UTC] deep_drive: but so far very fun
[2017-05-06 02:09:40 UTC] soulrider95: Maybe easy if you're playing on Easy Kappa

[2017-05-06 04:21:48 UTC] bethebaby: The recoil would indeed knock you around, and there's no consensus on whether or not a gun would work in space. It's not the zero G, it's the lack of oxygen.

[2017-05-06 04:22:54 UTC] doctorzzz: i mean rockets burn in space
[2017-05-06 04:23:39 UTC] bootycheekwarrior: Modern bullets have their own oxidizer so there's no need for oxygen in the air.

[2017-05-06 18:03:32 UTC] darksydephil: that should become a meme
[2017-05-06 18:03:33 UTC] bbt_2017: Woot almost time for more prey 😃

[2017-05-06 18:05:53 UTC] jonathan_snow: people are early today woohooo
[2017-05-06 18:05:57 UTC] ufccurbstomp: That's generally why bigger streamers have 5 dollar/500 bit requirements for notifications to show up - trolling gets expensive then :P
[2017-05-06 18:06:12 UTC] supremedeadly: Wassup
[2017-05-06 18:06:24 UTC] darksydephil: maybe ill up the requirement to at least $2
[2017-05-06 18:06:24 UTC] sanguinenite: @ufccurbstomp I didnt know that big streamers make trolling expensive LOL
[2017-05-06 18:06:31 UTC] darksydephil: because ive seen a lot of spammed $1 tips
[2017-05-06 18:06:42 UTC] jwalker70: I'm teething right now :(
[2017-05-06 18:06:56 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeah make trolling expensive and then maybe maybe they will start thinking of getting a life
[2017-05-06 18:06:59 UTC] supremedeadly: @darksydephil I don't know, bits are pretty easy to get just from watching the ads and shit
[2017-05-06 18:07:31 UTC] dooley258: How many bits do you get from the ads?
[2017-05-06 18:07:38 UTC] sanguinenite: 10 bits
[2017-05-06 18:07:45 UTC] blue_blur64: between 5 and 100 bits
[2017-05-06 18:07:55 UTC] supremedeadly: It's rng
[2017-05-06 18:07:59 UTC] darksydephil: ok i changed it to a $2 tip requirement
[2017-05-06 18:08:01 UTC] supremedeadly: But people spam the shits
[2017-05-06 18:08:23 UTC] dooley258: I see, they're pretty expensive if u buy them
[2017-05-06 18:08:33 UTC] darksydephil: btw you can now cheer on mobile
[2017-05-06 18:08:37 UTC] ufccurbstomp: How do you spam it, just have multiple streams going at once?
[2017-05-06 18:08:37 UTC] darksydephil: but you cant' buy the bits on mobile
[2017-05-06 18:08:39 UTC] darksydephil: so...lol

[2017-05-06 18:08:56 UTC] jwalker70: I just tip. It's easier
[2017-05-06 18:09:18 UTC] darksydephil: they created custom bit emotes for cheers in excess of 1000 i think, not 100% sure
[2017-05-06 18:09:23 UTC] supremedeadly: Btw how is everyone?
[2017-05-06 18:09:31 UTC] ufccurbstomp: good here

[2017-05-06 18:14:52 UTC] ufccurbstomp: well the difference is that everything was "eh" in bioshock infinite
[2017-05-06 18:15:07 UTC] captcaveman4201: i just watched Dr Strange movie. was pretty good
[2017-05-06 18:15:43 UTC] 0megaj0ker: To bad in this Prey, you have no spirit Eagel

[2017-05-06 18:18:39 UTC] phoenixrising2015: This Prey is actually like The Thing after I saw it which someone said it was like and I disagreed. The only difference is you don't get absorbed. You just get copied. So sorry to that person.
[2017-05-06 18:18:43 UTC] 0megaj0ker: there your example TriHard

[2017-05-06 18:19:31 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like in The Thing the monster would eat you, and then put out a perfect copy. In this, you can just be a clone and pretend to not be and have the real you and a clone pointing at each other saying "Its them!"

[2017-05-06 18:31:09 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and actually observe it
[2017-05-06 18:31:17 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and go through puzzles with your body on a button

[2017-05-06 18:32:27 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The Original Prey relied on messing with your vision too
[2017-05-06 18:32:43 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Most rooms had lifts that would have you wall running, ceiling running
[2017-05-06 18:32:45 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Portals etc
[2017-05-06 18:32:50 UTC] falconhoof1: Great playthrough 👍
[2017-05-06 18:33:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and it was legit like you had to adjust and be like "WAIT am I upside do--Woah I teleported!"
[2017-05-06 18:33:11 UTC] 0megaj0ker: original Prey is like a lite version of Doom with emotion, since Doom is all about Rip & Tear :D

[2017-05-06 20:59:43 UTC] pcgamehunter: Didn't he play metro ?
[2017-05-06 20:59:45 UTC] helljumphaze: @phoenixrising2015 Adrian chase is fucking up Oliver bad lol
[2017-05-06 20:59:54 UTC] vendatus: Phoenix I thought it was Waller CoolStoryBob
[2017-05-06 21:00:00 UTC] bethebaby: /me flails in pool
[2017-05-06 21:00:02 UTC] stuart360: I think this is more of a mystery thriller game, than a scary game
[2017-05-06 21:00:02 UTC] bethebaby: :D :D
[2017-05-06 21:00:25 UTC] sunlightmedal: \ Kappa /
[2017-05-06 21:00:27 UTC] betheallen: i played metro 1 and 2 they were fun
[2017-05-06 21:00:33 UTC] theycallmejimbob: POORLY MADE
[2017-05-06 21:00:33 UTC] stuart360: He's played both Metro's
[2017-05-06 21:00:41 UTC] pcgamehunter: Yeah I thought he did
[2017-05-06 21:00:41 UTC] blue_blur64: wow that generated room was awful lol
[2017-05-06 21:00:52 UTC] betheallen: /me splashes water over bethebaby face
[2017-05-06 21:01:07 UTC] phoenixrising2015: yeah I quit Arrow when Laurel died
[2017-05-06 21:01:12 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I was so angry
[2017-05-06 21:01:13 UTC] vendatus: gotta get the cabbage Artyom MingLee
[2017-05-06 21:01:26 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You don't kill off the freaking Black Canary
[2017-05-06 21:01:28 UTC] betheallen: :D
[2017-05-06 21:01:33 UTC] phoenixrising2015: And I can't watch The Flash anymore
[2017-05-06 21:01:36 UTC] fairhair96: are all the enemies in this game small critters?
[2017-05-06 21:01:39 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Hulu took it off the site
[2017-05-06 21:01:41 UTC] encelor: no
[2017-05-06 21:01:50 UTC] helljumphaze: @phoenixrising2015 i know and now her sistet is a freaking time traveler wtf lol
[2017-05-06 21:01:52 UTC] phoenixrising2015: its like a deal to get it on netflix faster after the season is over
[2017-05-06 21:01:53 UTC] kinggoken: you can watch the flash on the cws app :)
[2017-05-06 21:01:59 UTC] kinggoken: for free
[2017-05-06 21:02:03 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Oh I love me some Sara though
[2017-05-06 21:02:15 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Oh sweet
[2017-05-06 21:02:22 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Yeah I love the Flash
[2017-05-06 21:02:26 UTC] deep_drive: so the gun has a display that says the bullets loaded in the gun AND how many shells you have on you...i call bullshit on that
[2017-05-06 21:02:26 UTC] bethebaby: @fairhair96 Nah there are these big black dudes running around.
[2017-05-06 21:02:28 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and Supergirl is so adorable on the Flash
[2017-05-06 21:02:31 UTC] helljumphaze: Sara is white canary now and she knows some league moves
[2017-05-06 21:02:31 UTC] betheallen: GIMME SUPERGIRL
[2017-05-06 21:02:35 UTC] betheallen: all i need
[2017-05-06 21:02:40 UTC] vendatus: But Phoenix she'll be back next season as Black Siren full time MingLee
[2017-05-06 21:02:43 UTC] betheallen: gotham and walking dead too
[2017-05-06 21:02:47 UTC] blue_blur64: most futuristic games do that deep drive
[2017-05-06 21:02:58 UTC] deep_drive: dspHmm
[2017-05-06 21:02:59 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I didn't like the first Flash crossover with Supergirl
[2017-05-06 21:03:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Barry was pretty much worthless in the fight
[2017-05-06 21:03:08 UTC] encelor: @DarksydePhil you can upgeade your health
[2017-05-06 21:03:12 UTC] helljumphaze: @betheallen is Gotham any good?
[2017-05-06 21:03:16 UTC] dondom9: Something I don't understand about CoD WWII is if Sony has the marketing rights... Why not make it an exclusive
[2017-05-06 21:03:22 UTC] vendatus: Gotham so good this season VoHiYo
[2017-05-06 21:03:23 UTC] fairhair96: @bethebaby that sounds... racially sensitive
[2017-05-06 21:03:23 UTC] phoenixrising2015: He literally spent 60% of the fight knocked out
[2017-05-06 21:03:33 UTC] pcgamehunter: Honestly this has gone away from the survival horror to more combat, not really that interesting to watch :/
[2017-05-06 21:03:35 UTC] blue_blur64: because Activision wouldn't let it be an exclusive
[2017-05-06 21:03:44 UTC] blue_blur64: They gotta do what makes them the most money of course
[2017-05-06 21:03:44 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Me as a fan: ....This is not what would happen
[2017-05-06 21:03:45 UTC] stuart360: lol do you have any idea how much money it would take to make COD exclusive?
[2017-05-06 21:03:51 UTC] betheallen: if you like detective work and batman lore then yes gotham is great and it is action-y
[2017-05-06 21:03:53 UTC] mk4eva: lol Gotham. i'm only waiting till Jerome becomes fully the Joker and little Bruce Wayne becoming fully Batman
[2017-05-06 21:03:55 UTC] kinggoken: tons and tons of money
[2017-05-06 21:04:02 UTC] musasplanet: Was hoping for a COD Modern Warfare 4... Fight Isis and stuff lol
[2017-05-06 21:04:10 UTC] kinggoken: more money than the duck from duck tales has
[2017-05-06 21:04:11 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Supergirl in the crossovers was so adorkable
[2017-05-06 21:04:17 UTC] phoenixrising2015: "What makes her so super?"
[2017-05-06 21:04:21 UTC] phoenixrising2015: *She floats up*
[2017-05-06 21:04:22 UTC] mfd4419: Cod goat
[2017-05-06 21:04:26 UTC] bigowlbear: i like how FF13 got panned for putting all the story in datalogs, but when every other game does it, it's fine lmao
[2017-05-06 21:04:27 UTC] blue_blur64: that could be interesting musas
[2017-05-06 21:04:28 UTC] bethebaby: @fairhair96 What do you want me to say? They're big, and they're black. Like, black-black. Like a black hole. And they're kinda wormy, like the little critters.
[2017-05-06 21:04:28 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and has that cute smile
[2017-05-06 21:04:31 UTC] betheallen: the main stories of gotham are bruce wayne, gordon and penguin
[2017-05-06 21:04:31 UTC] mybusinessdood: Uggggggh
[2017-05-06 21:04:33 UTC] shadowdoomx: hi
[2017-05-06 21:04:37 UTC] helljumphaze: I get really confused who the actual flash is because the new justice league coming out has a different flash
[2017-05-06 21:04:37 UTC] betheallen: more than any others
[2017-05-06 21:04:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Thats another universe
[2017-05-06 21:04:49 UTC] stuart360: Sony would probably go broke if they paid what it would take to get COD exclusive
[2017-05-06 21:04:56 UTC] conky89: I find it funny that everyone bashes COD saying its fanbase lacks the braincells to play any other game yet no one talking ill about COD4
[2017-05-06 21:04:58 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The flash everyone knows atm is Grant Gustin on the CW
[2017-05-06 21:05:15 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I didn't like how Arrow tried turning Oliver into Bruce Wayne
[2017-05-06 21:05:16 UTC] kinggoken: cod 4 was epic
[2017-05-06 21:05:24 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like the Ra's Al Ghul stuff
[2017-05-06 21:05:28 UTC] phoenixrising2015: That was Batman's role
[2017-05-06 21:05:29 UTC] kinggoken: it went downhill from there though
[2017-05-06 21:05:30 UTC] helljumphaze: they need to bring green arrow into the movies
[2017-05-06 21:05:31 UTC] dondom9: Blame like any CoD fanboy would HAVE to get a PS4/Pro...
[2017-05-06 21:05:36 UTC] betheallen: bruce wayne is bruce NO ONE ELSE CAN BE
[2017-05-06 21:05:38 UTC] bethebaby: @Conky89 Nostalgia clouds their judgment and butchers their objectivity. CoD4 is every bit as fucked up, broken, and unbalanced as its sequels.
[2017-05-06 21:05:39 UTC] musasplanet: cod 4 was like 10 years ago. advanced warfare killed it for me
[2017-05-06 21:05:42 UTC] phoenixrising2015: In the comics Ra's wants BATMAN to be the leader
[2017-05-06 21:05:44 UTC] musasplanet: the black ops were good though
[2017-05-06 21:05:48 UTC] betheallen: stupid arrow is stupid
[2017-05-06 21:05:57 UTC] phoenixrising2015: They literally pushed Oliver into Batman's role
[2017-05-06 21:06:00 UTC] blue_blur64: same with the arkham games phoenix, right?
[2017-05-06 21:06:03 UTC] phoenixrising2015: yes
[2017-05-06 21:06:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: And in real life
[2017-05-06 21:06:09 UTC] kinggoken: arrow has went downhill
[2017-05-06 21:06:18 UTC] phoenixrising2015: It took ten real life years of comics before Batman was able to beat Ra's in a fight
[2017-05-06 21:06:31 UTC] vendatus: But it made sense on Arrow imo
[2017-05-06 21:06:39 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like for ten real years issues would come out of Batman fighting crime
[2017-05-06 21:06:40 UTC] mk4eva: Poising Ivy in Gotham tho. she's fine af
[2017-05-06 21:06:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and finally he beats Ra's
[2017-05-06 21:06:50 UTC] dondom9: Well any CoD Fanboy who has a Xbox One or PC would have to get a PS4 yes exclusivity is Anti Consumer but nothing like a push
[2017-05-06 21:06:55 UTC] betheallen: ras al ghul is a BATMAN villain
[2017-05-06 21:07:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Also
[2017-05-06 21:07:14 UTC] phoenixrising2015: How in the world did Oliver beat Nyssa?
[2017-05-06 21:07:14 UTC] kinggoken: batman should cameo on Arrow
[2017-05-06 21:07:19 UTC] kinggoken: that would be an awesomoe episode
[2017-05-06 21:07:27 UTC] vendatus: he can't
[2017-05-06 21:07:32 UTC] phoenixrising2015: There is no way Oliver should have beaten Nyssa in the show
[2017-05-06 21:07:39 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The first time they fought Oliver owned her
[2017-05-06 21:07:40 UTC] stuart360: They couldn't do it, it would simply cost too much moiney. Even Microsoft haven't tried to get COD exclusive and they have money to burn
[2017-05-06 21:07:41 UTC] dondom9: Anyone expects anything outta Sonys E3 Conference
[2017-05-06 21:07:41 UTC] helljumphaze: yeah oliver uses gatchets and they even reference thre bat cave by saying arrow cave as a joke lol
[2017-05-06 21:07:47 UTC] thesaurusboy: waddddddaaaapppp'????
[2017-05-06 21:07:58 UTC] betheallen: well ARROW is now the GREEN arrow
[2017-05-06 21:08:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Still
[2017-05-06 21:08:07 UTC] phoenixrising2015: He was only training for five years
[2017-05-06 21:08:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Nyssa was training since childhood
[2017-05-06 21:08:21 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and Oliver fought with her over Sara
[2017-05-06 21:08:23 UTC] kinggoken: has DSP said what he thinks of this game yet?
[2017-05-06 21:08:26 UTC] blue_blur64: what kind of ammo is that turret shooting? O_o
[2017-05-06 21:08:27 UTC] kinggoken: it seems like he likes it
[2017-05-06 21:08:33 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and literally tied with her if not beat it
[2017-05-06 21:08:34 UTC] helljumphaze: Hes a quick learner
[2017-05-06 21:08:42 UTC] dondom9: My friend is expecting more on God of War PS4 nothing else
[2017-05-06 21:08:44 UTC] roadsamurai: Use your EMP
[2017-05-06 21:08:59 UTC] rivainimage: Is this Half-Life 3?
[2017-05-06 21:09:14 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I was so hoping Batman would beat Damien Darhk
[2017-05-06 21:09:15 UTC] abbe35: no 4
[2017-05-06 21:09:16 UTC] helljumphaze: Anyway the arrow cave is doomed
[2017-05-06 21:09:22 UTC] conky89: They are turning God of War into The last of us...
[2017-05-06 21:09:23 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like out of nowhere smoke fills the room
[2017-05-06 21:09:27 UTC] mk4eva: God of War 4 coming in 2018 i believe
[2017-05-06 21:09:31 UTC] betheallen: heh heh heh phil died
[2017-05-06 21:09:33 UTC] mk4eva: can't wait
[2017-05-06 21:09:38 UTC] vendatus: You can argue DeathStroke is a Batman villain but he was the best part of Arrow S2 MingLee
[2017-05-06 21:09:40 UTC] kinggoken: i thought god of war 4 was coming this year
[2017-05-06 21:09:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and you heard Damien say "YOU!" and a Batman voice go "ME." and then Batman and damien are gone
[2017-05-06 21:09:47 UTC] mk4eva: nope
[2017-05-06 21:09:52 UTC] theycallmejimbob: welp NotLikeThis
[2017-05-06 21:09:52 UTC] phoenixrising2015: setting up the next season
[2017-05-06 21:09:52 UTC] kinggoken: dang :(
[2017-05-06 21:09:56 UTC] helljumphaze: people are saying batman might come into arrow lol
[2017-05-06 21:09:58 UTC] dondom9: Am
[2017-05-06 21:10:09 UTC] blue_blur64: Not confirmed yet king
[2017-05-06 21:10:09 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Deathstroke is the only person Batman can't beat
[2017-05-06 21:10:17 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Forget the Arkham games
[2017-05-06 21:10:20 UTC] phoenixrising2015: they ruined it
[2017-05-06 21:10:28 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Deathstroke legit has Batman's number
[2017-05-06 21:10:29 UTC] mk4eva: also, the rumor of that leaked Playstation All Stars sequel in the works
[2017-05-06 21:10:34 UTC] vendatus: Arrow died when Olicity happened MingLee
[2017-05-06 21:10:35 UTC] thepastryarchy: Aww almost had it!
[2017-05-06 21:10:40 UTC] mk4eva: *leaked info
[2017-05-06 21:10:42 UTC] blue_blur64: mk4 O_o
[2017-05-06 21:10:44 UTC] kinggoken: playstation all stars was actually pretty tight
[2017-05-06 21:10:45 UTC] blue_blur64: please no
[2017-05-06 21:10:47 UTC] thekasamoto: Batman also can't beat Heartattack.
[2017-05-06 21:10:49 UTC] kinggoken: just needed a better roster of characters
[2017-05-06 21:10:49 UTC] xgameofpwns: Phil you need to improve your aim
[2017-05-06 21:10:50 UTC] conky89: That was bullshit in Akrham Knight how quickly Batman took down Deathstroke
[2017-05-06 21:10:55 UTC] phoenixrising2015: It was
[2017-05-06 21:10:55 UTC] helljumphaze: @vendatus lmao ikr
[2017-05-06 21:11:03 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I will saw Arkham Origins I liked that he won
[2017-05-06 21:11:10 UTC] dondom9: Anyone expecting Sony to make a copy of the Nintendo Switch
[2017-05-06 21:11:14 UTC] phoenixrising2015: because it made Batman look like he legit was amazing
[2017-05-06 21:11:22 UTC] mk4eva: i like it. i din't mind the "super" only killing move
[2017-05-06 21:11:26 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and Deathstroke saying "Who are you?!"
[2017-05-06 21:11:28 UTC] kinggoken: arkham knight was kind of disappointing
[2017-05-06 21:11:29 UTC] helljumphaze: @vendatus its happening again too
[2017-05-06 21:11:37 UTC] blue_blur64: I really hope they don't dondom, we don't need another Wii copycat situation
[2017-05-06 21:11:41 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I did like that in Arkham Origins
[2017-05-06 21:11:42 UTC] vendatus: Yup
[2017-05-06 21:11:54 UTC] phoenixrising2015: but even then Deathstroke was a problem. He wasn't a quick boss
[2017-05-06 21:11:57 UTC] mk4eva: but this time, the leaked info said Super will return but will not be the only way to kill
[2017-05-06 21:11:58 UTC] dondom9: Well depends how they do it...
[2017-05-06 21:12:03 UTC] kinggoken: lol sony will copy off Nintendo
[2017-05-06 21:12:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Oh speaking of Supergirl
[2017-05-06 21:12:06 UTC] kinggoken: they always do
[2017-05-06 21:12:16 UTC] kinggoken: The ps move was just like the wii mote and nunchuck
[2017-05-06 21:12:21 UTC] conky89: Arkham Origins was an unnecessary game overall. It only got made so that WB could keep their cashcow flowing
[2017-05-06 21:12:22 UTC] phoenixrising2015: In one episode of Season 2, they showed why Man of Steel and Batman vs superman are bad Superman movies
[2017-05-06 21:12:30 UTC] vendatus: Also screw Iris let her die bring Patty back Kreygasm
[2017-05-06 21:12:32 UTC] mk4eva: my main was Zeus
[2017-05-06 21:12:35 UTC] mk4eva: lol
[2017-05-06 21:12:39 UTC] phoenixrising2015: One simple episode of Supergirl with Superman showed why Superman should be fun
[2017-05-06 21:13:17 UTC] dondom9: Ok the PS5 rumor anyone think that's possible
[2017-05-06 21:13:26 UTC] conky89: I do not really like this trend of trying to make Superman into a dark, edgy character like Batman. That is not the point of Superman
[2017-05-06 21:13:30 UTC] kinggoken: to soon for them to annoucne a new playstation
[2017-05-06 21:13:30 UTC] blue_blur64: too soon dondom
[2017-05-06 21:13:31 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The entire time Superman was on Supergirl, it was fun, filled with excitement, and everything was just happy. Why? Because Superman was there and Superman never lets anything bad happen
[2017-05-06 21:13:33 UTC] mk4eva: and Radec
[2017-05-06 21:13:40 UTC] kinggoken: the ps4 pro came out not that long ago
[2017-05-06 21:13:48 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The part with the children was the most telling part
[2017-05-06 21:13:49 UTC] kinggoken: i think next year they will announce ps5
[2017-05-06 21:13:50 UTC] blue_blur64: Like, 2019-2020 would be the proper time
[2017-05-06 21:13:55 UTC] phoenixrising2015: where Superman blocked them from being hit
[2017-05-06 21:14:01 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and they awed in wonder
[2017-05-06 21:14:08 UTC] vendatus: Batman won't be on CW because Gotham gut once it tanks Kappa
[2017-05-06 21:14:08 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and Superman simply turned his head, and winked at them
[2017-05-06 21:14:18 UTC] thesaurusboy: everyone is talking about this game rn but prey 1 was ass
[2017-05-06 21:14:21 UTC] vendatus: but*
[2017-05-06 21:14:24 UTC] mk4eva: the PS4 will only be 4 years old this November
[2017-05-06 21:14:26 UTC] bigdaddycool28716: the Redbox near my house got this today im thinking about going to get it for a couple days
[2017-05-06 21:14:29 UTC] phoenixrising2015: That is what Superman show be in the movies
[2017-05-06 21:14:32 UTC] thekasamoto: Supergirl should be a Trans-Man and Superman a Trans-Woman. For more diversity!
[2017-05-06 21:14:34 UTC] mk4eva: still so young
[2017-05-06 21:14:39 UTC] dondom9: Funnily if they did it's almost like all 3 consoles were "Wii Us" cus they all ended early
[2017-05-06 21:14:46 UTC] kinggoken: lol

[2017-05-06 21:17:25 UTC] kinggoken: do you like the game dsp?
[2017-05-06 21:17:35 UTC] thekasamoto: This will be just like Skyrim-playthrough: Whole game explored but no missions done.
[2017-05-06 21:17:36 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like maybe he wakes up but is weak
[2017-05-06 21:17:38 UTC] thepastryarchy: It's important to distinguish "lost" from "sidetracked" though ;)

[2017-05-06 21:24:49 UTC] stuart360: TDKR isn't a bad film ,but there is a lot of syupid stuff in it. You could tell Nolan was ready to move on
[2017-05-06 21:24:51 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Nolan should have have them use his music

[2017-05-06 21:33:41 UTC] conky89: There is really not much reason to play on consoles these days. Really only for exclusive games
[2017-05-06 21:33:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: It legit looked like what it would be like if Batman existed and was like a ninja
