[2017-05-16 16:30:44 UTC] errnoent: How are you doing today?
[2017-05-16 16:37:10 UTC] deadpylons: any one else got injustice
[2017-05-16 16:39:22 UTC] errnoent: I don't, I have been considering it though. I am a Netherrealm fan but not really DC
[2017-05-16 16:39:43 UTC] deadpylons: then you may enjoy th dlc
[2017-05-16 16:40:16 UTC] whitewolf64: i have crippling depression
[2017-05-16 16:40:26 UTC] deadpylons: wanna talk about it
[2017-05-16 16:40:28 UTC] errnoent: I'm almost there wolf
[2017-05-16 16:40:41 UTC] zahvone: Hello hello
[2017-05-16 16:40:45 UTC] apexhell117: I would have but its not on pc, been playing the mobile version though
[2017-05-16 16:41:41 UTC] deadpylons: the mobile game is pretty fun tba
[2017-05-16 16:41:48 UTC] deadpylons: but give it time and thepc por will come
[2017-05-16 16:41:54 UTC] whitewolf64: it was just a meme hope nobody took it seriously
[2017-05-16 16:44:13 UTC] deadpylons: it is usually a joke when someone says that the are depressed in a twitch chat
[2017-05-16 16:44:24 UTC] deadpylons: or that is what I have seen at least
[2017-05-16 16:49:00 UTC] errnoent: Not in here it's not
[2017-05-16 16:49:14 UTC] errnoent: Poor cherdy is a good example
[2017-05-16 16:49:34 UTC] zahvone: o.o
[2017-05-16 16:49:38 UTC] deadpylons: im not familiar with that individual
[2017-05-16 16:49:45 UTC] errnoent: You will be, just wait
[2017-05-16 16:50:32 UTC] deadpylons: im guessing that he comes here regularly
[2017-05-16 16:50:42 UTC] errnoent: Almost every day, right Z?
[2017-05-16 16:50:47 UTC] greenjenni: I've been here all day!!
[2017-05-16 16:51:55 UTC] deadpylons: I guess ill be getting to know you people alittle more since he is going doing a ru through of injustice
[2017-05-16 16:52:57 UTC] whitewolf64: injustice 2 seems shit
[2017-05-16 16:53:19 UTC] deadpylons: How if you don't mind me asking?
[2017-05-16 16:54:00 UTC] errnoent: All I need to know is if it's better, worse or the same as MKX
[2017-05-16 16:54:11 UTC] errnoent: because I loved that game so much
[2017-05-16 16:55:03 UTC] deadpylons: I think it Is easy to pull of combos and move around areas than MKX
[2017-05-16 16:55:05 UTC] apexhell117: looks like its trending toward better than mkx
[2017-05-16 16:56:03 UTC] zahvone: Sorry, I've been gone
[2017-05-16 16:56:07 UTC] zahvone: Yes, Cherdy is usually here always.
[2017-05-16 16:56:25 UTC] zahvone: Welcome to the channel, Dead.
[2017-05-16 16:56:32 UTC] deadpylons: Thank you
[2017-05-16 16:56:50 UTC] whitewolf64: injustice 1 was meh since it really just felt like a mk reskin with dc heroes and injustice 2 is pretty much the exact same game with better graphics and customization
[2017-05-16 16:56:52 UTC] zahvone: :)
[2017-05-16 16:57:20 UTC] deadpylons: im curious as to whether or not DSP has singed up for the tournament for injustice for a chance at the pot
[2017-05-16 16:57:41 UTC] zahvone: I'm not sure
[2017-05-16 16:57:46 UTC] zahvone: I bet you could ask him, though.
[2017-05-16 16:58:26 UTC] deadpylons: @WhiteWolf64 I can see that in all honesty but I`m just a sucker for fighters so I love both of the games so far
[2017-05-16 16:58:41 UTC] whitewolf64: doesnt he always sign up for fighting game tournaments? isn't that like his thing
[2017-05-16 16:58:58 UTC] errnoent: WhiteWolf64 Kappa
[2017-05-16 16:59:45 UTC] deadpylons: @Zahvone Im not sure he will answer because im a new face here and from what I can see about him it I kind of difficult if you are semi new to his streams
[2017-05-16 17:00:34 UTC] whitewolf64: i am a fan of fighters too and with that i mean only mk doa tekken and mvc
[2017-05-16 17:00:52 UTC] errnoent: Deadpylons as long as you're not trolling he'll answer anything
[2017-05-16 17:01:53 UTC] whitewolf64: just went to his channel and oh shit he already finished Prey
[2017-05-16 17:02:02 UTC] whitewolf64: ive barely touched that game lmao
[2017-05-16 17:02:37 UTC] deadpylons: what is considered a troll here because I got banned from another streamers chat for giving him information about a music guy he wanted and I got labled as a troll
[2017-05-16 17:02:50 UTC] zahvone: @Deadpylons I'll ask him for you, at some time.
[2017-05-16 17:03:01 UTC] deadpylons: Thank you
[2017-05-16 17:03:02 UTC] whitewolf64: @Deadpylons that sounds...odd
[2017-05-16 17:03:46 UTC] errnoent: Deadpylons trolls here are typically people that make snide comments about his financial situation, his fiancee, make fun of his nasal drip and so on
[2017-05-16 17:04:24 UTC] whitewolf64: but i can semi relate as i got perma banned from a channel for saying i didnt want the nameless king's spear and i was giving it to anyone who asked
[2017-05-16 17:04:37 UTC] whitewolf64: so if i say *snort* i get banned?
[2017-05-16 17:04:37 UTC] nightbot: WhiteWolf64 -> I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS! [warning]
[2017-05-16 17:04:52 UTC] deadpylons: wait what
[2017-05-16 17:04:53 UTC] whitewolf64: yes the answer is yes lmao
[2017-05-16 17:04:54 UTC] errnoent: ??
[2017-05-16 17:05:10 UTC] deadpylons: why did half of what you said get removed
[2017-05-16 17:05:54 UTC] whitewolf64: you can press on the <message delete> to read what it said if you are intrested
[2017-05-16 17:06:19 UTC] whitewolf64: unless you are on mobile it doesnt work there
[2017-05-16 17:06:30 UTC] deadpylons: it wont let me. which is why I was also confused
[2017-05-16 17:06:52 UTC] nuclear_armed_hogs: Im on PC and it doesn't let me

[2017-05-16 17:09:08 UTC] whitewolf64: i just said ***
[2017-05-16 17:09:19 UTC] errnoent: God damn you guys remember when Phil did that DSP tries it of the batman cereal, and was wearing that ridiculous batman mask?
[2017-05-16 17:09:32 UTC] errnoent: my sides
[2017-05-16 17:09:45 UTC] deadpylons: I think dsp should stream earlier and end at the same time to have a higher chance of getting new people to come in
[2017-05-16 17:09:58 UTC] whitewolf64: phil has made so many dsp tries it that at this point its impossible to follow
[2017-05-16 17:10:04 UTC] zahvone: Nahhhh
[2017-05-16 17:10:42 UTC] whitewolf64: the only memorable dsp tries it was that slushy magic because the slush looked horrible and the axe one which was pure gold
[2017-05-16 17:11:39 UTC] deadpylons: Axe? the tool or shampoo
[2017-05-16 17:11:55 UTC] whitewolf64: shampoo
[2017-05-16 17:11:57 UTC] zahvone: the body thing
[2017-05-16 17:12:04 UTC] errnoent: god damn I gotta look that one up now
[2017-05-16 17:12:06 UTC] whitewolf64: that video was pure gold
[2017-05-16 17:12:45 UTC] deadpylons: that's sounds like a strange thing to review

[2017-05-16 17:13:42 UTC] deadpylons: so I guess no links
[2017-05-16 17:14:25 UTC] errnoent: Yeah no links, nightbot is a little ridiculous about that. Also no emote spam
[2017-05-16 17:15:34 UTC] errnoent: Also no caps abuse, SoK bullshit, and spoilers
[2017-05-16 17:15:51 UTC] deadpylons: I don't know an emotes so I think I`m good in that department but I think it should be ok to post a youtube link
[2017-05-16 17:16:10 UTC] deadpylons: Sok Bullshit?
[2017-05-16 17:16:22 UTC] deadpylons: oh wait nvm I know what you mean
[2017-05-16 17:16:37 UTC] errnoent: Yeah nightbot should be smarter about link handling
[2017-05-16 17:17:11 UTC] errnoent: about a lot of things actually
[2017-05-16 17:18:00 UTC] deadpylons: nightbot is strange but i like it the way my mod set it up a while back
[2017-05-16 17:18:15 UTC] errnoent: it just needs some tweaking, I don't have access to it though
[2017-05-16 17:19:28 UTC] deadpylons: DSP could set it up before todays stream
[2017-05-16 17:20:39 UTC] deadpylons: it will take like 5 min of his time
[2017-05-16 17:23:34 UTC] errnoent: Yeah, thekingofhate.com
[2017-05-16 17:23:34 UTC] nightbot: errnoent -> Wake up, get up, get timed out! (Don't post links) [warning]

[2017-05-16 17:30:29 UTC] deadpylons: How long does it take for him to set up a stream?
[2017-05-16 17:31:05 UTC] apexhell117: well he starts in 30 mins and then talks for 40 mins with pictures flying by
[2017-05-16 17:31:45 UTC] deadpylons: why does ho talk for 40 min?
[2017-05-16 17:32:08 UTC] apexhell117: prestream talking segment lol
[2017-05-16 17:32:32 UTC] deadpylons: That sounds weird
[2017-05-16 17:33:16 UTC] deadpylons: he was going to talk for more 40 why not get the stream 40 min early to talk about what ever and start on a specific time
[2017-05-16 17:33:42 UTC] apexhell117: idk its just how he does him
[2017-05-16 17:34:09 UTC] ratchefan12: not big fans of the prestream
[2017-05-16 17:34:13 UTC] ratchefan12: i see
[2017-05-16 17:34:18 UTC] apexhell117: I would totally do what u just said though bet then again I would probably just talk about what i need to talk about during gameplay dspHmm
[2017-05-16 17:34:22 UTC] zahvone: @Deadpylons It gives people a chance to filter in, while discussing things and to "Warm up
[2017-05-16 17:34:38 UTC] zahvone: It's actually a good idea, but the quality of execution is purely subjective
[2017-05-16 17:34:53 UTC] zahvone: Sorry, objective?
[2017-05-16 17:35:13 UTC] zahvone: Yeah, no subjective. I can't english lately.
[2017-05-16 17:35:34 UTC] apexhell117: in a fighting game we warmup in practice mode Kappa
[2017-05-16 17:35:38 UTC] deadpylons: @Zahvone i totally get that but it still seems strange
[2017-05-16 17:35:40 UTC] zahvone: :o
[2017-05-16 17:35:52 UTC] zahvone: @Deadpylons Do you know of anyone else who does that?

[2017-05-16 17:36:56 UTC] ratchefan12: whitewolf then dont watch it andcome back later
[2017-05-16 17:37:19 UTC] whitewolf64: eh i still have stream chat to keep me busy
[2017-05-16 17:37:29 UTC] whitewolf64: if it doesnt fill with spam
[2017-05-16 17:37:30 UTC] ratchefan12: there ya go
[2017-05-16 17:37:55 UTC] ratchefan12: just chat with people
[2017-05-16 17:38:03 UTC] errnoent: Yeah I really like the pre-streams
[2017-05-16 17:38:12 UTC] deadpylons: when i helped set up for SKILLS USA we would always stream everything but we set a starting time and do a prestream for hour or so before the starting time and we would announce what would take place and what could possible happen
[2017-05-16 17:38:40 UTC] deadpylons: that was the warm up time for us at least
[2017-05-16 17:39:30 UTC] whitewolf64: i mean tbh its a fighting game no real story or anything so the entire time would be perfect for him to say the prestream but i guess that depends on if he goes on online matches or not
[2017-05-16 17:39:44 UTC] errnoent: some prestreams are shorter than others
[2017-05-16 17:40:02 UTC] errnoent: they can be pretty entertaining
[2017-05-16 17:40:27 UTC] deadpylons: i personally think he should do online matchers since the stor has already been beaten for about a month now
[2017-05-16 17:40:28 UTC] errnoent: if he's playing a game I'm not interested in I'll usually just watch prestream and then peace out
[2017-05-16 17:41:00 UTC] ratchefan12: i like the prestreams gives me a chance to say hi to phil beforehand
[2017-05-16 17:41:20 UTC] zachty200: hey everyone
[2017-05-16 17:41:27 UTC] ratchefan12: he likes to start with the story though
[2017-05-16 17:41:54 UTC] whitewolf64: im probably gonna sound way too negative for this and sound like im shitting all over phil but to me interactivity is half the stream and phil doesnt talk too much to his viewers during gameplay
[2017-05-16 17:42:09 UTC] deadpylons: why though
[2017-05-16 17:42:10 UTC] errnoent: He is doing more of that now
[2017-05-16 17:42:24 UTC] errnoent: watch the week in preview vlogs dude
[2017-05-16 17:43:03 UTC] whitewolf64: maybe i just havent caught up with the recent dsp
[2017-05-16 17:43:04 UTC] ratchefan12: dead is the way he does fightig games
[2017-05-16 17:43:36 UTC] whitewolf64: fighting games are a diffrent topic since online needs concentration
[2017-05-16 17:45:03 UTC] yacherdy: oi
[2017-05-16 17:45:06 UTC] whitewolf64: doesnt he already start at around this time

[2017-05-16 17:45:34 UTC] yacherdy: and then actual game play after 12:00
[2017-05-16 17:45:36 UTC] errnoent: Yeah he joins the chat right around 11AM PDT
[2017-05-16 17:45:44 UTC] errnoent: then he'll chat in stream for like 15 to 30 mins
[2017-05-16 17:45:47 UTC] errnoent: then start talking on stream
[2017-05-16 17:46:10 UTC] whitewolf64: we dont share timezones so i have no idea when that is
[2017-05-16 17:46:10 UTC] apexhell117: dspWowdude
[2017-05-16 17:46:23 UTC] errnoent: 11AM PDT is not when the stream starts, it's when he starts setting up and talking to people
[2017-05-16 17:46:37 UTC] yacherdy: 45 minutes is when pre stream starts and and hour to hour 15 minutes from now is when gameplay starts
[2017-05-16 17:47:07 UTC] yacherdy: he really likes to "build anticipation" Kappa

[2017-05-16 23:48:05 UTC] shadowbane1992: Phoenixrising2015 the mask contains Dr Fate, the spirit (or whatever) of Order, and he looks for those who have enough magical restraint to wield his power, and indentures them into the service of Order.
[2017-05-16 23:48:13 UTC] kushiyakitori: @BeTheAllen my sound glitched for half a second at that point
