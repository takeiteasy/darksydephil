[2017-05-18 02:22:13 UTC] vendatus: Bane has Luchadore gear MingLee
[2017-05-18 02:22:27 UTC] derichloveslemur: Banes like a grappler and damage dealer
[2017-05-18 02:22:30 UTC] hindae: @thirdeyethethird He uploads in 720 for the sake of bitrate
[2017-05-18 02:22:36 UTC] derichloveslemur: cause he does do a lot of damage.
[2017-05-18 02:22:43 UTC] alicerises: Bane needs more green :P
[2017-05-18 02:22:44 UTC] thirdeyethethird: oh ok

[2017-05-18 02:22:50 UTC] gooptroop: could you read this slower so i can keep up????
[2017-05-18 02:22:53 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DJLunaEclipse Hopefully the Lex Express is a DLC of Injustice 2.
[2017-05-18 02:23:06 UTC] nukacolaking: Tom Hardy Bane voice dlc just $5 Kappa
[2017-05-18 02:23:14 UTC] hindae: @Bammbino I know that, but I think Phil didnt bother with it

[2017-05-18 02:24:47 UTC] kozatof: That is bane?
[2017-05-18 02:24:54 UTC] kozatof: Joke, he is so small
[2017-05-18 02:24:57 UTC] nukacolaking: "something something cheerleading tryouts"
[2017-05-18 02:24:57 UTC] dspfandood: Dr.Phil im cia
[2017-05-18 02:25:06 UTC] derichloveslemur: Bane is a cool character in Injustice.
[2017-05-18 02:25:12 UTC] kozatof: He is not a big guy
[2017-05-18 02:25:14 UTC] blk_mage_ctype: Phil has said in the past that he won't do Charity streams because he views them as disingenuous publicity stunts, and prefers to donate to charity anonymously.
[2017-05-18 02:25:38 UTC] monsterenvy: Do Darkseid traning next
[2017-05-18 02:25:46 UTC] derichloveslemur: He went through all of Deadshots bullets that is sick!
[2017-05-18 02:25:54 UTC] bammbino: @kozatof this is the alternate people

[2017-05-18 02:26:05 UTC] derichloveslemur: He is basically: nope! nope! nope!
[2017-05-18 02:26:17 UTC] batmangamer181: level 3 vemon does a lot damage
[2017-05-18 02:26:30 UTC] young_wobblez: is this game in the top 10 of the year so far for you Phil?
[2017-05-18 02:26:35 UTC] katexo234: sick superman skin
[2017-05-18 02:26:47 UTC] kozatof: @bammbino huh?
[2017-05-18 02:26:57 UTC] bammbino: @Young_Wobblez he seems to refuse to answer anything like that, but he keeps making fun of SF5
[2017-05-18 02:27:03 UTC] kozatof: Did you see how big bane was in injustice 1
[2017-05-18 02:27:04 UTC] derichloveslemur: @katexo234 Bane's probably gonna be a Phil Mainer.
[2017-05-18 02:27:25 UTC] rawky7: grundataker
[2017-05-18 02:27:25 UTC] monsterenvy: Don't forget to use Venom
[2017-05-18 02:27:26 UTC] young_wobblez: @Bammbino I mean it's clear as day that this game is better than the shit that is SF5
[2017-05-18 02:27:44 UTC] vendatus: Pretty sure the Godfall skin was in i1 CoolStoryBob
[2017-05-18 02:28:08 UTC] derichloveslemur: Bane has a tombstone, piledriver, powerbomb definitely a striker a grappler
[2017-05-18 02:28:25 UTC] bammbino: @Young_Wobblez oh yeah, we all see it but im just saying thats what phil mentions when we ask about how he places the game and what not to protect his thoughts for a review
[2017-05-18 02:28:39 UTC] katexo234: maybe or batman @derichloveslemur
[2017-05-18 02:28:56 UTC] young_wobblez: @Bammbino I mean it's fair
[2017-05-18 02:29:02 UTC] young_wobblez: and he seems to be enjoying the game
[2017-05-18 02:29:20 UTC] derichloveslemur: Bane is a good character he has great moves.
[2017-05-18 02:29:29 UTC] bammbino: @kozatof injustice is based on an alternate universe
[2017-05-18 02:29:46 UTC] bammbino: @kozatof superman is different and so is bane, joker and more
[2017-05-18 02:29:54 UTC] nukacolaking: Anyone else think that SuperMan in this looks a little like Bill Paxton?
[2017-05-18 02:30:06 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, You can meter burn the spinebuster
[2017-05-18 02:30:26 UTC] d3a7h_proof_1978: welp i decided to buy this guise.... gonna play the story tonight after phil finishes his khantent on here 4Head
[2017-05-18 02:30:28 UTC] bammbino: @kozatof theres even articles that are recent that cover how wild and confusing it can be based on the character lore that NRS chose to use
[2017-05-18 02:30:31 UTC] andreii1984: hello
[2017-05-18 02:30:41 UTC] young_wobblez: Does this game have a long learning curve if i never played an injusitce game? I'm getting this the first week of June.
[2017-05-18 02:30:43 UTC] kozatof: @bammbino yeah I played injustice one and bane was huge
[2017-05-18 02:30:49 UTC] mightysandwich: There's a tournament on right now with a Bane player tick throwing people to death. lol
[2017-05-18 02:30:57 UTC] thesaurusboy: Gorilla grodd ftw
[2017-05-18 02:30:59 UTC] derichloveslemur: What is the spine buster for Bane I wonder.
[2017-05-18 02:31:10 UTC] jmon_1985: kappa100
[2017-05-18 02:31:20 UTC] monsterenvy: Don't forget to use venom to increase your power
[2017-05-18 02:31:30 UTC] thesaurusboy: It's an Ariel grab I think
[2017-05-18 02:31:31 UTC] bammbino: @Young_Wobblez i played injustice 1 and its a bit on the easier end to get into, but good players in the fighting community dominate online
[2017-05-18 02:31:49 UTC] sp1cymaymay: Play some multiplayer, the majority of people are probably rubbish anyway
[2017-05-18 02:32:01 UTC] young_wobblez: @Bammbino so you're saying i should not play online until i get good? I'll get destoryed
[2017-05-18 02:32:13 UTC] young_wobblez: @Bammbino is it harder to pull of combos than in Street fighter?
[2017-05-18 02:32:18 UTC] derichloveslemur: Bane has a Spinebuster which can be meter burned and can probably be combo'ed
[2017-05-18 02:32:24 UTC] bammbino: @Young_Wobblez do not jump into MP any time soon! this game is balanced around an armor system
[2017-05-18 02:32:34 UTC] rawky7: who's Phil's favourite characters so far?
[2017-05-18 02:32:36 UTC] bammbino: @Young_Wobblez have you played witcher or any gear based rpg?
[2017-05-18 02:32:46 UTC] young_wobblez: @Bammbino Fallout?
[2017-05-18 02:32:52 UTC] mightysandwich: You can get even more with the trait, Phil
[2017-05-18 02:32:55 UTC] derichloveslemur: Bane has some sick combos
[2017-05-18 02:33:01 UTC] johnmatrix31: bane has a rko?
[2017-05-18 02:33:03 UTC] derichloveslemur: I am enjoying this.
[2017-05-18 02:33:05 UTC] dspfandood: phil likes swamp thang
[2017-05-18 02:33:14 UTC] monsterenvy: Check how much damage it does with venom on
[2017-05-18 02:33:17 UTC] dspfandood: he also said supergal is his waifu
[2017-05-18 02:33:18 UTC] hindae: Outta NOWHERE
[2017-05-18 02:33:21 UTC] dubh13: Gear is disabled in ranked...
[2017-05-18 02:33:21 UTC] johnmatrix31: @darksydephil how do u do the rko with bane
[2017-05-18 02:33:25 UTC] katexo234: I wonder if we're going to get any movie skins for injustice 2?
[2017-05-18 02:33:33 UTC] bammbino: @Young_Wobblez good enough! you can equip armor in this game like RPGs that give X Y or Z stats and some bonuses to skills, moves, combos, and more
[2017-05-18 02:33:41 UTC] vendatus: you can do ranked mp it nullifies the gear
[2017-05-18 02:33:48 UTC] dspfandood: DC movies? KappaHD
[2017-05-18 02:33:48 UTC] nerozero88: @katexo234 we will, as well as tv show skins
[2017-05-18 02:34:03 UTC] young_wobblez: @Bammbino So should i main a character or 2 and get lots of gear before playing online?
[2017-05-18 02:34:03 UTC] johnmatrix31: dark knight rises bane plzz
[2017-05-18 02:34:05 UTC] katexo234: :)
[2017-05-18 02:34:10 UTC] derichloveslemur: that's a spine buster?
[2017-05-18 02:34:19 UTC] johnmatrix31: thats not a spine buster
[2017-05-18 02:34:20 UTC] derichloveslemur: It looks like a mandible claw hold and cancel
[2017-05-18 02:34:23 UTC] bammbino: @Young_Wobblez you're gonna want to do the story and then go back and do the "alternate" fights so you unlock loot chests
[2017-05-18 02:34:32 UTC] nerozero88: definitely using stephen amell green arrow
[2017-05-18 02:34:45 UTC] johnmatrix31: @darksydephil that dosent look like a spine buster triple h does
[2017-05-18 02:34:45 UTC] dubh13: No you don't need gear to play online just play ranked and gear doesn't matter
[2017-05-18 02:34:45 UTC] bammbino: @Young_Wobblez after that, do the tutorial for each character to get more loot and then do multiverse
[2017-05-18 02:34:45 UTC] randomron005: Try cutting the jab after that.
[2017-05-18 02:34:50 UTC] young_wobblez: @Bammbino I'm thinking of using Scarecrow and Mr Freeze mostly
[2017-05-18 02:34:53 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, Lol I thought Bane was gonna do a Triple H like a spine buster.
[2017-05-18 02:34:55 UTC] d3a7h_proof_1978: omg i hate twitch .. i gotta quit coming this site... you people are fucking dick licks .... why can't the world blow up and you all just die?

[2017-05-18 02:36:15 UTC] bammbino: so bane
[2017-05-18 02:36:29 UTC] young_wobblez: is it worth it to buy the game with all the DLC or just the base game? In Canada the base game is $90 and the game with all the DLC is $135.
[2017-05-18 02:36:31 UTC] rawky7: bring back the Grunditaker

[2017-05-18 03:57:16 UTC] epicnessunleashedcontent: The catch 22 with this streaming business is the following: You need to stream new premium priced video games to have a modicum of a chance to earn views. However, without the partnership you cannot monetize your content and therefore cannot afford to finance the purchase of new games which you will need just to have an iota of chance for a partnership.

[2017-05-18 17:45:40 UTC] kozatof: He should up difficulty for ladder
[2017-05-18 17:45:52 UTC] kozatof: It's easy as hell
[2017-05-18 17:47:04 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The gamefaqs for Injustice 2 is vicious
[2017-05-18 17:47:21 UTC] phoenixrising2015: They actually have a thread up of a guy who admitted he was going to buy this game solely to troll
[2017-05-18 17:47:37 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and someone made a thread about him showing him rage quit when he got owned by the topic creator

[2017-05-18 17:48:15 UTC] grim_blades: you guys watching the Destiny 2 reveal
[2017-05-18 17:50:01 UTC] kozatof: I guess phil dropped multi verse for those shit ladder modes
[2017-05-18 17:50:24 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Too bad all the good gear is there
[2017-05-18 17:50:30 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and you can change entire move sets with them
[2017-05-18 17:50:52 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You can even make Green Lantern into a different character entirely from what I just heard
[2017-05-18 17:50:52 UTC] kozatof: Ladder mode isn't even entertaining except for the brainiac fights
[2017-05-18 17:51:05 UTC] kozatof: It's crap
[2017-05-18 17:51:19 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Apparently with the right gear Green Lantern gets all his Injustice 1 moves back
[2017-05-18 17:51:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I think DSP needs to learn Captain Cold
[2017-05-18 17:51:51 UTC] phoenixrising2015: He would wreck Deadshot with him
[2017-05-18 17:52:07 UTC] kozatof: Dead shot is the best character in game
[2017-05-18 17:52:11 UTC] phoenixrising2015: All he would have to do is Ice wall
[2017-05-18 17:52:14 UTC] phoenixrising2015: then rush
[2017-05-18 17:52:20 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and start the beat down
[2017-05-18 17:52:25 UTC] kozatof: Dead shot is the best character in game.
[2017-05-18 17:52:34 UTC] kozatof: Believe me
[2017-05-18 17:52:42 UTC] phoenixrising2015: And believe me, I've seen it happen
[2017-05-18 17:52:53 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The Ice Wall Captain Cold does blocks all of his bullets
[2017-05-18 17:52:54 UTC] kozatof: Then they were awful with him
[2017-05-18 17:53:05 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and then it is sent all the way to the other side of the map
[2017-05-18 17:53:06 UTC] kozatof: A good dead shot is unbeatable
