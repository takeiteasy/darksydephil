[2017-05-31 02:03:37 UTC] theadamlee23: 112 crimes?! Holy shit.
[2017-05-31 02:04:10 UTC] theadamlee23: How many years? Actually, I don't wanna know.
[2017-05-31 02:04:22 UTC] darthvidarviking: aww Mort.
[2017-05-31 02:04:23 UTC] darksydephil: yeah its mass fraud
[2017-05-31 02:04:37 UTC] darksydephil: it would mean serious jailtime if caught and they have his name and address. he's a fucking retard
[2017-05-31 02:04:37 UTC] litterial: you're disputing them all now?
[2017-05-31 02:04:51 UTC] chrisbreezy00: wait what happened?
[2017-05-31 02:04:55 UTC] theadamlee23: What was I about say is, I had shitty luck joining a game with Phil.
[2017-05-31 02:04:56 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Mass fraud wtf
[2017-05-31 02:05:03 UTC] taurusoxford: RIP Mort
[2017-05-31 02:05:18 UTC] deep_drive: awww and i thought he was a fan all along
[2017-05-31 02:05:19 UTC] litterial: a troll tipper disputed all his donations
[2017-05-31 02:05:23 UTC] taurusoxford: @chrisbreezy00 Mort disputed every tip he gave Phil - 112 of them
[2017-05-31 02:05:37 UTC] theadamlee23: If I somehow join Phil in a quickplay game, that would be the balls.
[2017-05-31 02:05:49 UTC] chrisbreezy00: LOL mort is playing a serious game the Paypal does not like getting jewed
[2017-05-31 02:05:55 UTC] darksydephil: in total Mort tipped about $200 over time, and i kept every single dollar in the account in case he did this. and now he did
[2017-05-31 02:06:00 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Paypal will be sending hitmen to his house ASAP
[2017-05-31 02:06:10 UTC] mythstorm24: Sup everyone
[2017-05-31 02:06:15 UTC] darksydephil: at the very least his account will be closed
[2017-05-31 02:06:29 UTC] theadamlee23: suspended?
[2017-05-31 02:06:31 UTC] mythstorm24: Oh no what happened now?
[2017-05-31 02:06:44 UTC] blue_blur64: So I don't know if anyone saw the release date trailer for Sonic Mania, but man that game it going to be great! Also gave me a new profile pic for the forums :P
[2017-05-31 02:06:45 UTC] belvin_21: lol what happened now?
[2017-05-31 02:07:01 UTC] taurusoxford: @MythStorm24 Mort is trying to reclaim all the tips he gave Phil
[2017-05-31 02:07:02 UTC] blue_blur64: Basically Mort potentially committed mass fraud
[2017-05-31 02:07:10 UTC] litterial: Some troll disputed all his donations (112 of them)
[2017-05-31 02:07:10 UTC] mythstorm24: Really?
[2017-05-31 02:07:14 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Mort finally realized he spent all his rent money on donations and had to pull out LOL
[2017-05-31 02:07:20 UTC] darksydephil: not potentially, this IS mass fraud
[2017-05-31 02:07:24 UTC] darksydephil: he'd go to jail for a while if caught
[2017-05-31 02:07:30 UTC] mythstorm24: Wasn't he the guy who donated for StarTrek VR or is that another guy?
[2017-05-31 02:07:37 UTC] blue_blur64: Different person
[2017-05-31 02:07:39 UTC] mythstorm24: well tipped
[2017-05-31 02:07:43 UTC] theadamlee23: What a fucking loser Mort was. What a dumbass.
[2017-05-31 02:07:44 UTC] bentboxer: speaking of which, when is phil going to play star trek vr
[2017-05-31 02:07:47 UTC] mythstorm24: ah ok well at least that's alright
[2017-05-31 02:07:54 UTC] blue_blur64: I actually listened to the prestream today about that too xD
[2017-05-31 02:07:57 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Yea US government takes Fraud very seriously especially on your taxes
[2017-05-31 02:08:02 UTC] litterial: @MythStorm24 no a different person that constantly donated small tips
[2017-05-31 02:08:04 UTC] mythstorm24: He's not sure if he wants to do it anymore.
[2017-05-31 02:08:07 UTC] belvin_21: Damn they dont wanna see phil winnin
[2017-05-31 02:08:09 UTC] mythstorm24: Yeah I
[2017-05-31 02:08:21 UTC] chrisbreezy00: So does PHil get to keep the money or not
[2017-05-31 02:08:29 UTC] blue_blur64: They're legit tips so yeah
[2017-05-31 02:08:36 UTC] theadamlee23: He's basically Leaf Apollo which I hate that guy so much.
[2017-05-31 02:08:39 UTC] litterial: he should it's unlikey they will side with the troll
[2017-05-31 02:08:40 UTC] belvin_21: they wanna see him in penatention
[2017-05-31 02:08:51 UTC] litterial: considering these are donations over 2 months
[2017-05-31 02:08:58 UTC] blue_blur64: Exactly
[2017-05-31 02:09:09 UTC] mythstorm24: I have seen him tip before repeatedly but I thought I heard him talking about the massive $200 dollars DSP got like in a 50 and a 150 earlier today.
[2017-05-31 02:09:09 UTC] gadnukbreakerofworld: have i missed the stream?
[2017-05-31 02:09:12 UTC] taurusoxford: no
[2017-05-31 02:09:14 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Wow what was mort thinking
[2017-05-31 02:09:15 UTC] bentboxer: whats so funny about disputing all the 100+ donations?
[2017-05-31 02:09:17 UTC] taurusoxford: Phil is gonna be late
[2017-05-31 02:09:29 UTC] taurusoxford: he's busy disputing 112 tips that Mort is trying to reclaim
[2017-05-31 02:09:30 UTC] gadnukbreakerofworld: okay ty
[2017-05-31 02:09:32 UTC] belvin_21: he is late!
[2017-05-31 02:09:40 UTC] blue_blur64: Because that = mass fraud bentboxer
[2017-05-31 02:09:50 UTC] belvin_21: jk do ya thing phil
[2017-05-31 02:09:54 UTC] special_agent_dimitri: I just came here, what's going on?
[2017-05-31 02:09:57 UTC] chrisbreezy00: i wonder who mort really is i would feel bad if hes some 12 year old kid LOL
[2017-05-31 02:10:02 UTC] bentboxer: im trying to see how the guy would get entertainment out of this
[2017-05-31 02:10:06 UTC] litterial: I know what Mort is wrong, but how is it fraud?
[2017-05-31 02:10:07 UTC] gadnukbreakerofworld: who is mort? and damn 112 different tips? that would be a kick in the nuts
[2017-05-31 02:10:18 UTC] blue_blur64: Basically Mort is trying to reclaim every tip he gave Phil
[2017-05-31 02:10:20 UTC] theadamlee23: Mort and Leaf Apollo are fucking idiots. That's all I can say.
[2017-05-31 02:10:22 UTC] taurusoxford: 12 year old kids don't have access to 200+ dollars
[2017-05-31 02:10:34 UTC] bentboxer: how old do you have to be to get a credit card
[2017-05-31 02:10:42 UTC] mythstorm24: He's claiming they were unauthorized when clearly they weren't @Litterial
[2017-05-31 02:10:50 UTC] darksydephil: by the way, I have the guy's real name which he had to give Paypal to send me money and then refund it. he's a literal idiot
[2017-05-31 02:10:52 UTC] litterial: ok makes sense
[2017-05-31 02:11:15 UTC] mythstorm24: Unless it's an alias? @DarksydePhil
[2017-05-31 02:11:15 UTC] deep_drive: The claim that someone didn't realize someoneused their account for 2 months is preposterous
[2017-05-31 02:11:19 UTC] goldencolts: yeah but you could just register a fake name on a visa prepaid card right
[2017-05-31 02:11:27 UTC] darksydephil: it cant be an alias, its the name of what he used to pay with lol
[2017-05-31 02:11:36 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Wow it would be one thing if he was some kid taking his parents card but an actual adult tried this
[2017-05-31 02:11:45 UTC] blue_blur64: Well the real question is, would you report him to the police or somebody else, or wait until you get contacted about it?
[2017-05-31 02:11:50 UTC] gadnukbreakerofworld: they will obviosly see these tips were given over a period of time in a pattern when you are live
[2017-05-31 02:12:03 UTC] eliskor: There's no way he can get his money back, isn't it all considered donations? Thus not really refundable?
[2017-05-31 02:12:08 UTC] gwentandchill: you can just buy cash cards at a store and use those
[2017-05-31 02:12:15 UTC] belvin_21: Heard, someone stole there moms card to get a shoutout from phil! LMAO
[2017-05-31 02:12:17 UTC] deep_drive: yup Eliskor
[2017-05-31 02:12:27 UTC] belvin_21: THIER*
[2017-05-31 02:12:29 UTC] chrisbreezy00: You have a better chance of winning the lottery before you get paypal to give you a refund
[2017-05-31 02:12:33 UTC] special_agent_dimitri: @Deep_Drive I'm confused, what happened?
[2017-05-31 02:12:37 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, so it's useless regardless brownLUL
[2017-05-31 02:12:48 UTC] bentboxer: dont say how to get the money back on here
[2017-05-31 02:13:07 UTC] chrisbreezy00: what was mort actually thinking
[2017-05-31 02:13:10 UTC] deep_drive: someone is trying to dispute 112 of his tips Special_Agent_Dimitri
[2017-05-31 02:13:18 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Did he somehow think they would just give him all his money back LOL
[2017-05-31 02:13:18 UTC] special_agent_dimitri: oh shit
[2017-05-31 02:13:19 UTC] gadnukbreakerofworld: can you imagine giving a street performer money and then coming back a week later for your tip back
[2017-05-31 02:13:24 UTC] gadnukbreakerofworld: after youd heard them play
[2017-05-31 02:13:25 UTC] taurusoxford: @chrisbreezy00 Pretty sure he wasn't...
[2017-05-31 02:13:26 UTC] mythstorm24: Paypal has been getting pretty good with chargebacks and streamers. Usually the streamer wins the dispute now though it was not always like that.
[2017-05-31 02:13:27 UTC] blue_blur64: He probably thought it'd be funny to give Phil plenty of money and then magically take it away
[2017-05-31 02:13:50 UTC] deep_drive: problem is it doesn't work and you can get in big trouble for it
[2017-05-31 02:13:53 UTC] blue_blur64: And never thought of the consequences of doing so
[2017-05-31 02:14:06 UTC] goldencolts: consequences will never be the same
[2017-05-31 02:14:46 UTC] chrisbreezy00: i mean its not very surprising all his tips were troll messages LOL
[2017-05-31 02:14:47 UTC] darksydephil: the only real hassle to me is diong all these disputes etc
[2017-05-31 02:14:52 UTC] gwentandchill: Getting one of those $50 - $100 cash cards from stores and using that is safer than using your real credit card
[2017-05-31 02:14:54 UTC] darksydephil: i kept the money on purpose thinking all along he'd do that
[2017-05-31 02:15:12 UTC] blue_blur64: Well it's gonna be different depending on the situation, but there are still consequences regardless
[2017-05-31 02:15:20 UTC] popsicolo: People who reference Love Live can't be trusted KappaHD
[2017-05-31 02:15:34 UTC] mythstorm24: Wouldn't that just cause you more hassle by keeping it when you know he's most likely a troll?
[2017-05-31 02:15:51 UTC] theadamlee23: Good thing I'm not a streamer just yet.
[2017-05-31 02:15:51 UTC] gwentandchill: Paypal just closes their accounts, its not in the tens of thousands, so its nothing to Paypal
[2017-05-31 02:15:52 UTC] mythstorm24: I mean yeah now you have a case with PayPal but it's their judgement call.
[2017-05-31 02:15:54 UTC] blue_blur64: Well no reason to give it back Myth since it's a tip :P
[2017-05-31 02:16:03 UTC] deep_drive: You gotta love niconiconii pops :D
[2017-05-31 02:16:10 UTC] darksydephil: this guy got 112 on screen messages, so his money is mine. plain and simple.
[2017-05-31 02:16:11 UTC] blue_blur64: Unless the person asks for it back of course as discussed in today's prestream
[2017-05-31 02:16:12 UTC] darthvidarviking: I find it weird if you don't get to keep the money. one time could be an accident. 100 times is pretty premeditated or whatever
[2017-05-31 02:16:15 UTC] theadamlee23: I was but today, it's been different.
[2017-05-31 02:16:26 UTC] mythstorm24: Right.
[2017-05-31 02:16:28 UTC] bentboxer: thats not funny at all. this is how you be funny.
[2017-05-31 02:16:37 UTC] bentboxer: whats 6 inches long 2 inches wide and makes women go crazy
[2017-05-31 02:16:43 UTC] gadnukbreakerofworld: adding up to a total of how much is he trying to screw you out of?
[2017-05-31 02:16:50 UTC] taurusoxford: 224 dollars
[2017-05-31 02:16:53 UTC] blue_blur64: Half a footlong sub at Subway? Kappa
[2017-05-31 02:16:58 UTC] bentboxer: a hundred dollar bill
[2017-05-31 02:17:05 UTC] taurusoxford: assuming every tip was 2 bucks which it usually was
[2017-05-31 02:17:12 UTC] mythstorm24: Not a footlong just a foot
[2017-05-31 02:17:17 UTC] theadamlee23: @DarksydePhil I'm considering to buy the red DSPGaming Logo T-Shirt for my birthday this June.
[2017-05-31 02:17:30 UTC] litterial: is a dollar bill actually 6 inches long?
[2017-05-31 02:17:34 UTC] kingjezal: What's going on? I missed it. I'm guessing it's about mort
[2017-05-31 02:17:36 UTC] litterial: or specially a 100
[2017-05-31 02:17:41 UTC] blue_blur64: yes
[2017-05-31 02:17:42 UTC] mythstorm24: Not that I'm aware of.
[2017-05-31 02:17:42 UTC] taurusoxford: Yes Jezal
[2017-05-31 02:17:53 UTC] taurusoxford: Mort is trying to dispute all his tips
[2017-05-31 02:17:55 UTC] blue_blur64: He's trying to reclaim every tip he gave Phil
[2017-05-31 02:17:57 UTC] taurusoxford: 112 of them
[2017-05-31 02:17:57 UTC] mythstorm24: Well I'm Canadian our money is different.
[2017-05-31 02:17:57 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Mort tried to pull a Jew but didnt work
[2017-05-31 02:18:12 UTC] mythstorm24: A jew? Isn't that offensive...
[2017-05-31 02:18:15 UTC] gadnukbreakerofworld: lol pull a jew
[2017-05-31 02:18:19 UTC] blue_blur64: Which he's kind of dumb for trying :P
[2017-05-31 02:18:28 UTC] kingjezal: Is mort a detractor or just someone messing around?
[2017-05-31 02:18:37 UTC] blue_blur64: Probably a detractor
[2017-05-31 02:18:38 UTC] mythstorm24: Might be either idk
[2017-05-31 02:18:45 UTC] deep_drive: at this point hes a detractor
[2017-05-31 02:18:45 UTC] kingjezal: That's great, then.
[2017-05-31 02:18:58 UTC] yaslothy: What's up.
[2017-05-31 02:19:02 UTC] gadnukbreakerofworld: its like attempted sabotage
[2017-05-31 02:19:05 UTC] deep_drive: hi yaslothy
[2017-05-31 02:19:18 UTC] mythstorm24: True true. If he did infact tip too much he could have asked phil for a refund on some of them.
[2017-05-31 02:19:24 UTC] theadamlee23: I'll be sure to tweet DSP with my picture of my new DSPGaming shirt.
[2017-05-31 02:19:24 UTC] blue_blur64: Because for multiple months of giving 2 dollars tips a day, it had to be planned out
[2017-05-31 02:19:46 UTC] mythstorm24: But by doing a charge back he's definitely trying to screw Phil.
[2017-05-31 02:19:50 UTC] micgelo09: hm
[2017-05-31 02:20:00 UTC] mythstorm24: Why today though?
[2017-05-31 02:20:05 UTC] blue_blur64: He's trying, but it's not gonna work
[2017-05-31 02:20:17 UTC] nin10dont: is that all this channel is?
[2017-05-31 02:20:21 UTC] micgelo09: oh im sure EVERY1 is out for phil (sarcasm)
[2017-05-31 02:20:24 UTC] darksydephil: it didnt work last time someone did this, and that was about 10 transactions
[2017-05-31 02:20:27 UTC] nin10dont: ive been here a few days but all there is is weird drama
[2017-05-31 02:20:30 UTC] deep_drive: It's unfortunate that you have to dispute each chargeback individually
[2017-05-31 02:20:31 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Idk how he could get a chargeback the money he tipped is already in his bank account
[2017-05-31 02:20:37 UTC] gadnukbreakerofworld: i would expect there is some kind of cooling off period after which you cannot ask for a refund? im totally ignorant on the law of this topic
[2017-05-31 02:20:45 UTC] mythstorm24: At least there's precedent then in your favour.
[2017-05-31 02:20:48 UTC] kingjezal: Shame on Twitch if it does work. Incompetence at its finest.
[2017-05-31 02:21:01 UTC] blue_blur64: He probably figured that he gave enough money to negatively affect Phil, if he understood how law works xD
[2017-05-31 02:21:05 UTC] mythstorm24: Not Twitch's fault. It's PayPal.
[2017-05-31 02:21:06 UTC] nin10dont: its not Twitch fault...
[2017-05-31 02:21:33 UTC] chrisbreezy00: i remember one streamer got several grand and someone tried to refund it but got denied
[2017-05-31 02:21:38 UTC] blue_blur64: I could look that up quick and find out if possible
[2017-05-31 02:21:50 UTC] kingjezal: Paypal, then. In the back of my mind I figured it wasn't down to Twitch.
[2017-05-31 02:22:00 UTC] deep_drive: yup i remember something like that too chris
[2017-05-31 02:22:06 UTC] rnrs: up

[2017-05-31 02:29:56 UTC] blue_blur64: Well he's attempting to charge back every tip he gave Phil
[2017-05-31 02:29:59 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Has Mort ever came to chat?
[2017-05-31 02:30:02 UTC] blue_blur64: nope

[2017-05-31 02:31:09 UTC] yaslothy: maybe he actually clicked the charge back button
[2017-05-31 02:31:10 UTC] kingjezal: You'd think someone would plan ahead more when messing around with that much money. Certainly not a mastermind, this mort.
[2017-05-31 02:31:11 UTC] yaslothy: 112 times
[2017-05-31 02:31:14 UTC] mythstorm24: I wish Phil could play Farpoint on PSVR. That game actually looks worth checking out.
[2017-05-31 02:31:16 UTC] yaslothy: accidentally*
[2017-05-31 02:31:20 UTC] dspfandood: Doesn't char backs fuck up your credit or something. What is more thinking?

[2017-05-31 02:34:19 UTC] micgelo09: could play some more rocket league or overwatch competitive if you dont have much to play
[2017-05-31 02:34:27 UTC] yaslothy: gotcha
[2017-05-31 02:34:39 UTC] dspfandood: Holy shit I read 12 charge backs

[2017-05-31 02:34:46 UTC] dspfandood: mort is crazy
[2017-05-31 02:34:49 UTC] kingjezal: Mort is a laughingstock, even was as it was going on.

[2017-05-31 02:35:16 UTC] yaslothy: God I'm such a fat fuck.
[2017-05-31 02:35:22 UTC] taurusoxford: Maybe Mort will try to argue that he deserves the money back cause Phil stopped reading his troll messages. :P
[2017-05-31 02:35:41 UTC] goldencolts: wat brand of mac n cheese
[2017-05-31 02:35:46 UTC] blue_blur64: That'd be a poor argument because he doesn't have to read any messages brownLUL

[2017-05-31 02:43:14 UTC] blue_blur64: no, they're real tips
[2017-05-31 02:43:25 UTC] dspfandood: lel 50000? damn
[2017-05-31 02:43:30 UTC] dspfandood: thats crazy
[2017-05-31 02:43:32 UTC] echito: o.O
[2017-05-31 02:43:37 UTC] blue_blur64: It's just that he's trying to get the money back so that Phil could possibly get in trouble
[2017-05-31 02:43:39 UTC] kinggio007: thats stupid
[2017-05-31 02:43:44 UTC] blue_blur64: In case he spent any of that money
[2017-05-31 02:43:46 UTC] rnrs: whos mort
[2017-05-31 02:43:48 UTC] katexo234: so mort was trolling the whole time
[2017-05-31 02:43:50 UTC] rnrs: 112 tips?
[2017-05-31 02:43:54 UTC] rnrs: totaling how much
[2017-05-31 02:43:58 UTC] ellietsantiara: @micgelo09 Actually here in MX it's called Pinol
[2017-05-31 02:44:02 UTC] blue_blur64: Yup, but he gave over $200 to try to troll him
[2017-05-31 02:44:14 UTC] blue_blur64: And as history shows, Paypal doesn't take troll tips too kindly
[2017-05-31 02:44:16 UTC] rnrs: lmao
[2017-05-31 02:44:17 UTC] ellietsantiara: Wow what s dick
[2017-05-31 02:44:20 UTC] deep_drive: over 200 dollars rnrs
[2017-05-31 02:44:24 UTC] ellietsantiara: *a
[2017-05-31 02:44:26 UTC] rnrs: phil can't catch a break
[2017-05-31 02:44:39 UTC] blue_blur64: So Phil's going to keep the money :P
[2017-05-31 02:44:40 UTC] rnrs: I'm actually starting to feel bad
[2017-05-31 02:44:40 UTC] micgelo09: same 4 sok
[2017-05-31 02:44:41 UTC] ellietsantiara: Phil should ban Mort then
[2017-05-31 02:44:41 UTC] deep_drive: im guessing paypal isn't gonna allow the chargeback though
[2017-05-31 02:44:42 UTC] katexo234: mort is do stupid that is what he gets sorry not sorry
[2017-05-31 02:44:48 UTC] dspfandood: Phil already spent the money on v8s KappaHD
[2017-05-31 02:44:50 UTC] blue_blur64: Mort isn't even a viewer here :P
[2017-05-31 02:44:57 UTC] micgelo09: same 4 sok being misunderstood
[2017-05-31 02:45:02 UTC] sok_pepe: Should have got into V8 stock early.
[2017-05-31 02:45:14 UTC] goldencolts: i wish i bought bitcoins BibleThump
[2017-05-31 02:45:19 UTC] litterial: @EllietSantiAra what's called pinol in MX?
[2017-05-31 02:45:21 UTC] theadamlee23: and Phil exposed the fuck out of Mort
[2017-05-31 02:45:30 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yeah I don't think paypal would put up with that shit, I hope everything is fine
[2017-05-31 02:45:32 UTC] belvin_21: Phil whats your favorite beer?
[2017-05-31 02:45:34 UTC] bobbyhill_187: rip to my MOTHAFUCKIN MORT
[2017-05-31 02:45:34 UTC] young_wobblez: Is phil going to play more tonight or just deal with this?
[2017-05-31 02:45:37 UTC] belvin_21: lmao
[2017-05-31 02:45:41 UTC] bobbyhill_187: Kappa
[2017-05-31 02:45:45 UTC] blue_blur64: He'll play more soon Wobblez
[2017-05-31 02:45:53 UTC] blue_blur64: stream will just end later
[2017-05-31 02:45:54 UTC] kinggio007: @young_wobblez hes gonna be late
[2017-05-31 02:46:13 UTC] dspfandood: He would have spent most of his time in matchmaking anyways
[2017-05-31 02:46:19 UTC] kinggio007: can people get off of Phil's dick tho?
[2017-05-31 02:46:20 UTC] ellietsantiara: Cleaner liquid that smells like forest. you drink, you did
[2017-05-31 02:46:21 UTC] rnrs: if I was Phil i'd do bits only
[2017-05-31 02:46:23 UTC] ellietsantiara: *die
[2017-05-31 02:46:28 UTC] rnrs: so he'd never have to deal with this
[2017-05-31 02:46:37 UTC] rnrs: if theres a chargeback it'll be twitch problem
[2017-05-31 02:46:37 UTC] theadamlee23: It's a lucky chance if I join a session with Phil. I never got the chance to play with him since that shitty invite system doesn't work.
[2017-05-31 02:46:39 UTC] kinggio007: @dspfandood true
[2017-05-31 02:47:08 UTC] darksydephil: its pretty unbelievable that the invites dont work, on top of all the other problems the game has lol
[2017-05-31 02:47:21 UTC] dspfandood: the game looks fun tho
[2017-05-31 02:47:23 UTC] kinggio007: @darksydephil hey dude
[2017-05-31 02:47:25 UTC] dspfandood: wasted potential
[2017-05-31 02:47:26 UTC] micgelo09: how does it work then
[2017-05-31 02:47:30 UTC] taurusoxford: It's fun when it works
[2017-05-31 02:47:30 UTC] gwentandchill: gotta play the superior PC version
[2017-05-31 02:47:35 UTC] micgelo09: im sure i can help with that
[2017-05-31 02:47:38 UTC] ellietsantiara: It could have been a good game
[2017-05-31 02:47:39 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, chances are I would've bought the game :P
[2017-05-31 02:47:40 UTC] taurusoxford: But that's the problem
[2017-05-31 02:47:50 UTC] ellietsantiara: it's a cool premise but, badly executed
[2017-05-31 02:47:51 UTC] blue_blur64: But instead I spent my money preordering Sonic Mania brownLUL
[2017-05-31 02:47:57 UTC] darksydephil: friday the 13th is literally the SFV of 2017
[2017-05-31 02:47:58 UTC] ellietsantiara: Evolve anyone?
[2017-05-31 02:48:00 UTC] darksydephil: same exact situaion
[2017-05-31 02:48:03 UTC] deep_drive: lol phil
[2017-05-31 02:48:18 UTC] ellietsantiara: True Phil
[2017-05-31 02:48:24 UTC] theadamlee23: Playstation 4 is a good system but has a shitty invite system that doesn't work when it is necessary to do so.
[2017-05-31 02:48:27 UTC] katexo234: :D phil
[2017-05-31 02:48:31 UTC] micgelo09: its a gud game it just needs polishing and some more variety
[2017-05-31 02:48:42 UTC] blue_blur64: adam, half the time things don't even load for me xD
[2017-05-31 02:48:44 UTC] eliskor: even when you get into a match it's just repetitive imo there's not much variety, kind of boring if you ask me
[2017-05-31 02:48:57 UTC] gwentandchill: play with friends
[2017-05-31 02:48:59 UTC] litterial: Well it's not the SFV of 2017 yet, they still have to release the underwhelming story mode, but yeah its a similar situtation
[2017-05-31 02:49:01 UTC] micgelo09: but for now max i'd pay 10$ maybe 15
[2017-05-31 02:49:02 UTC] blue_blur64: I end up backing out and retrying multiple times until something happens
[2017-05-31 02:49:12 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yeah Eliskor , it feels like a beta to Me still
[2017-05-31 02:49:21 UTC] yaslothy: PC Kreygasm
[2017-05-31 02:49:36 UTC] theadamlee23: The only way to play the game with Phil is to bypass the invite system or some random chance I get in.
[2017-05-31 02:49:40 UTC] yaslothy: Oblivion still a beautiful game 11 years later
[2017-05-31 02:49:44 UTC] yaslothy: Kreygasm
[2017-05-31 02:49:54 UTC] yaslothy: well besides the ugly character models
[2017-05-31 02:49:56 UTC] ellietsantiara: Same cut scenes all the time, same characters, same deaths and executions. Just plain lazy developers
[2017-05-31 02:49:58 UTC] belvin_21: hell no lol
[2017-05-31 02:50:05 UTC] gwentandchill: LUL
[2017-05-31 02:50:05 UTC] taurusoxford: Speaking of underwhelming story modes, I REALLY fucking hope Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite is Capcom's answer to Netherrealm Studios
[2017-05-31 02:50:22 UTC] katexo234: you think bethesda will ever make another skyrim
[2017-05-31 02:50:23 UTC] kinggio007: @taurusoxford most likely not
[2017-05-31 02:50:24 UTC] darksydephil: dont count on it haha
[2017-05-31 02:50:41 UTC] young_wobblez: I really wish base games didn't cost $90 in Canada. :/
[2017-05-31 02:50:43 UTC] hyperior21: Hey what's happening Phil and chat
[2017-05-31 02:50:44 UTC] ellietsantiara: @taurusoxford I wouldn't get .Y ho
[2017-05-31 02:50:46 UTC] rnrs: phil when you starting?
[2017-05-31 02:50:49 UTC] young_wobblez: i'd already have injustice 2
[2017-05-31 02:50:49 UTC] ellietsantiara: *get my hopes up
[2017-05-31 02:50:54 UTC] rnrs: do I have time to go smoke?
[2017-05-31 02:50:59 UTC] theadamlee23: I hope though. It would be the balls.
[2017-05-31 02:51:04 UTC] belvin_21: yea lol i did
[2017-05-31 02:51:10 UTC] yaslothy: you mean elder scrolls? I think something is in the works.
[2017-05-31 02:51:11 UTC] belvin_21: light it up!!
[2017-05-31 02:51:16 UTC] taurusoxford: Because it's starting to get really embarrassing for them at this point
[2017-05-31 02:51:21 UTC] yaslothy: its already been 6 years since skyrim
[2017-05-31 02:51:30 UTC] taurusoxford: They have all these amazing characters and they write a story worth a fuck with them
[2017-05-31 02:51:31 UTC] wolf_engine: Hey
[2017-05-31 02:51:37 UTC] ellietsantiara: Also maybe Fallout and Borderlands 3
[2017-05-31 02:51:38 UTC] young_wobblez: i heard the Player count on injustice 2 is already dead, is that bullshit?
[2017-05-31 02:51:38 UTC] matchingunderwear: Phil a lot of us are worried based on your tweet. is it bad news?
[2017-05-31 02:51:38 UTC] micgelo09: nice to see they removed regen from cod ww2
[2017-05-31 02:51:43 UTC] taurusoxford: they can't*
[2017-05-31 02:51:55 UTC] wolf_engine: whats this about the chargebacks?
[2017-05-31 02:51:57 UTC] blue_blur64: Wasn't the latest news that they weren't working on ES 6?
[2017-05-31 02:52:01 UTC] katexo234: I'm still waiting for the wolf among us season 3
[2017-05-31 02:52:02 UTC] belvin_21: first time tuning in to a live stream
[2017-05-31 02:52:11 UTC] ellietsantiara: @micgelo09 Yeah they went back to classic Call of duty
[2017-05-31 02:52:12 UTC] micgelo09: (slowly faps to the m14) (hears the reload) aaaaaahhhh
[2017-05-31 02:52:13 UTC] theadamlee23: WTH is going on my side of the game?!
[2017-05-31 02:52:16 UTC] wolf_engine: they are working on ES 6
[2017-05-31 02:52:19 UTC] wolf_engine: they got to be
[2017-05-31 02:52:24 UTC] theadamlee23: It glitched didn't it.
[2017-05-31 02:52:34 UTC] wolf_engine: You know how much money skyrim made right
[2017-05-31 02:52:40 UTC] blue_blur64: I doubt it since they're still heavy on ES Online
[2017-05-31 02:52:42 UTC] yaslothy: really @blue_blur64 ? wel;l fuck
[2017-05-31 02:52:43 UTC] litterial: @MatchingUnderwear Phil has to dispute illegit chargebacks (112 of them from the same guy)
[2017-05-31 02:52:50 UTC] wolf_engine: Thats zenimax
[2017-05-31 02:52:55 UTC] blue_blur64: There's the Morrowind expansion coming out soon
[2017-05-31 02:52:56 UTC] wolf_engine: Not bethesda game studios
[2017-05-31 02:52:59 UTC] darksydephil: 18 to go lol
[2017-05-31 02:53:02 UTC] theadamlee23: Wow. Nice bug! I can't play the game. LOL
[2017-05-31 02:53:05 UTC] yaslothy: ESO is fine and all but...
[2017-05-31 02:53:10 UTC] goldencolts: GingerPower
[2017-05-31 02:53:12 UTC] yaslothy: mah main ES games :(
[2017-05-31 02:53:20 UTC] jwalker70: so what happened?
[2017-05-31 02:53:27 UTC] theadamlee23: That was the first time it happened.
[2017-05-31 02:53:33 UTC] micgelo09: not gonna lie the m14 in any game excites me
[2017-05-31 02:53:35 UTC] blue_blur64: Mort being an idiot jwalker :P
[2017-05-31 02:53:35 UTC] pcgamehunter: es online is made by a different dev blue
[2017-05-31 02:53:37 UTC] wolf_engine: Morrowind patrons choice when @DarksydePhil
[2017-05-31 02:53:38 UTC] wolf_engine: :P
[2017-05-31 02:53:44 UTC] goldencolts: troll charged back dozens of small tips for over 200 dollars
[2017-05-31 02:53:46 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh
[2017-05-31 02:53:53 UTC] ellietsantiara: I want to see new games, New IPs
[2017-05-31 02:53:56 UTC] blue_blur64: Not dozens, over a 100 tips
[2017-05-31 02:54:12 UTC] goldencolts: over 100 can be dozens, i didnt remember the exact ammount
[2017-05-31 02:54:24 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, but dozens doesn't sound as big
[2017-05-31 02:54:26 UTC] wolf_engine: tbh I don't know whether to laugh or cry about that
[2017-05-31 02:54:32 UTC] jwalker70: thats the drama of the day? really?
[2017-05-31 02:54:38 UTC] pcgamehunter: Also Bethesda not working on TES is kind of like Activision not working on CoD
[2017-05-31 02:54:40 UTC] darksydephil: in that case, a million is "dozens" lol
[2017-05-31 02:54:43 UTC] charizard545: same happened with Etika, now hes homeless
[2017-05-31 02:54:45 UTC] blue_blur64: Well Phil has to dispute every single charge back :P
[2017-05-31 02:54:53 UTC] pcgamehunter: Especially since they're done with Fallout 4 now.
[2017-05-31 02:54:59 UTC] goldencolts: well i assume he did like a dozen a day
[2017-05-31 02:55:03 UTC] goldencolts: or something iunno
[2017-05-31 02:55:08 UTC] eliskor: I can see ES6 being announced at next year's E3
[2017-05-31 02:55:11 UTC] theadamlee23: Ok, I had a database login error and I got connected. I think it was just my internet.
[2017-05-31 02:55:11 UTC] blue_blur64: Isn't he working on getting a new place Charizard?
[2017-05-31 02:55:13 UTC] jwalker70: technically it is phil
[2017-05-31 02:55:18 UTC] ellietsantiara: Fuck that, I wanna see Fallout 5 or New Vegas 2
[2017-05-31 02:55:20 UTC] deep_drive: your name is very suspect Wolf_Engine lol
[2017-05-31 02:55:21 UTC] charizard545: yea he moved in already
[2017-05-31 02:55:27 UTC] jwalker70: just a lot of dozens
[2017-05-31 02:55:31 UTC] pcgamehunter: Doubt it will be announced before 2019
[2017-05-31 02:55:32 UTC] litterial: I'll take a wild guess that once Paypal looks at this issue it will take less time to make a verdict on the issue than the time it's taking Phil to dispute the chargeback.
[2017-05-31 02:55:38 UTC] uneven_sideburns: @Deep_Drive good looking out; always gotta be vigilant of trolls!
[2017-05-31 02:56:02 UTC] micgelo09: nice to know they fixed the rainbow six matchmaking.........somewhat
[2017-05-31 02:56:07 UTC] blue_blur64: Well it's easy for Paypal because they can probably get a list of every tip easily
[2017-05-31 02:56:14 UTC] jwalker70: a million is 83333.333333 dozens
[2017-05-31 02:56:24 UTC] yaslothy: FO4 season pass is so fucking expensive NotLikeThis
[2017-05-31 02:56:24 UTC] taurusoxford: Well, by the time Phil finishes and starts the stream up, he'll have time for one FT13 match. :P
[2017-05-31 02:56:25 UTC] yaslothy: cahman
[2017-05-31 02:56:27 UTC] pcgamehunter: Also beat TWD, it was ... alright i guess. Of course immediately at the end they announced more TWD :D
[2017-05-31 02:56:27 UTC] wolf_engine: How so?
[2017-05-31 02:56:30 UTC] blue_blur64: @jwalker70 NERRRRRRRRRRD! Kappa
[2017-05-31 02:56:53 UTC] ellietsantiara: @yaslothy To be fair, that's like 4 dlc and they're all good
[2017-05-31 02:56:57 UTC] taurusoxford: assuming the matchmaking is good
[2017-05-31 02:57:00 UTC] theadamlee23: You just had to make a NC vs AVGN reference didn't you? @blue_blur64
[2017-05-31 02:57:04 UTC] blue_blur64: Sorry, had to do the DBZ abridged quote Kappa
[2017-05-31 02:57:05 UTC] darksydephil: on the final 10 now
[2017-05-31 02:57:07 UTC] theadamlee23: LOL
[2017-05-31 02:57:10 UTC] jwalker70: dividing a million by 12 makes me a nerd?
[2017-05-31 02:57:14 UTC] yaslothy: i know but the season pass is barely ever on sale
[2017-05-31 02:57:16 UTC] goldencolts: PogChamp in the final dozen
[2017-05-31 02:57:16 UTC] blue_blur64: I've never watched AVGN or NC
[2017-05-31 02:57:17 UTC] yaslothy: oh well
[2017-05-31 02:57:25 UTC] deep_drive: Well Wolf engine = jackie chin was the account that gave phil a false copyright strike
[2017-05-31 02:57:40 UTC] uneven_sideburns: @blue_blur64 Don't waste your time; Phil is a lot better. AVGN is overhyped.
[2017-05-31 02:57:44 UTC] wolf_engine: its the name of a game engine
[2017-05-31 02:57:46 UTC] ellietsantiara: Ban Him just in case
[2017-05-31 02:57:53 UTC] deep_drive: im not saying you are him
[2017-05-31 02:57:56 UTC] blue_blur64: I was joking jwalker :P
[2017-05-31 02:58:01 UTC] deep_drive: just that it is suspicous
[2017-05-31 02:58:07 UTC] wolf_engine: I'd link but rules
[2017-05-31 02:58:20 UTC] jwalker70: i was joking back :p
[2017-05-31 02:58:28 UTC] blue_blur64: brownJOKES
[2017-05-31 02:58:29 UTC] deep_drive: lol EllietSantiAra
[2017-05-31 02:58:30 UTC] uneven_sideburns: oh no not false caaahpy right strikes
[2017-05-31 02:58:33 UTC] gwentandchill: Who is Steve Jones?!
[2017-05-31 02:58:35 UTC] uneven_sideburns: ban the heritic
[2017-05-31 02:58:54 UTC] ellietsantiara: Your grandpa
[2017-05-31 02:58:55 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's 5am and I can't sleep, what a day at work this shall be MingLee
[2017-05-31 02:59:17 UTC] blue_blur64: I can't wait for work tomorrow, so many herbs to prep
[2017-05-31 02:59:23 UTC] ellietsantiara: It's 10pm here and I have to close up shop soon
[2017-05-31 02:59:32 UTC] pcgamehunter: Blue works at a weed store or something ? Kappa
[2017-05-31 02:59:34 UTC] blue_blur64: Which btw guys, is such a long process brownFEELS

[2017-05-31 03:02:47 UTC] pcgamehunter: Honestly I hate birds ... my brain now associated bird chirping with 4am (around the time they start chirping) MingLee
[2017-05-31 03:02:54 UTC] arustybucket: yeah but paypal usually requires some sort of shout out to show that the payment was made willingly
[2017-05-31 03:03:00 UTC] goldencolts: its in the library of congress by now that jones video
[2017-05-31 03:03:04 UTC] rnrs: that actually could be a valid reason if he cuts enough video footage the right way
[2017-05-31 03:03:05 UTC] jwalker70: you mean the one with hitler?
[2017-05-31 03:03:12 UTC] blue_blur64: He does shout out though

[2017-05-31 05:08:15 UTC] ellietsantiara: Mort fucking got exposed
[2017-05-31 05:08:16 UTC] mustardish: wow
[2017-05-31 05:08:17 UTC] yaslothy: @insaiyan9000 MingLee

[2017-05-31 05:08:21 UTC] stormforcegamer: ...oh sorry it's early morning for me. lol
[2017-05-31 05:08:21 UTC] thirdeyethethird: did he succeed?
[2017-05-31 05:08:21 UTC] brokenheadsetgaming: oh shit
[2017-05-31 05:08:22 UTC] deep_drive: which phil had to individually dispute
[2017-05-31 05:08:24 UTC] jl_volken: Troll tipping is very much like cow tipping
[2017-05-31 05:08:27 UTC] deep_drive: for each one
[2017-05-31 05:08:31 UTC] micgelo09: y doesnt he save his previous broadcasts on twitch?
[2017-05-31 05:08:32 UTC] d1mech: so now what..? phil has to pay em back?

[2017-05-31 05:08:53 UTC] ellietsantiara: But Mort didn't succeed, the money is not his anyomre
[2017-05-31 05:09:06 UTC] d1mech: these trolls really take it to the next level -_-
[2017-05-31 05:09:08 UTC] thirdeyethethird: i thought you couldn't tip with paypal on twitch
[2017-05-31 05:09:11 UTC] unoriginaldavid: Tipping just to troll, what a moron
[2017-05-31 05:09:15 UTC] mustardish: smh the lengths these trolls go to
[2017-05-31 05:09:34 UTC] ellietsantiara: In total it must have been like over 300 dollars
[2017-05-31 05:10:07 UTC] unoriginaldavid: He had money to waste most probably
[2017-05-31 05:10:22 UTC] mustardish: anyway thanks for info. night yall
[2017-05-31 05:10:25 UTC] deep_drive: over 200 dollars
[2017-05-31 05:10:26 UTC] micgelo09: another rogue troll
[2017-05-31 05:10:29 UTC] jl_volken: Wait til you see what happens next. Tomorrow a new car will arrive at Phil's houise. Someone in the bushes takes pics and posts them. So rekt.
[2017-05-31 05:10:33 UTC] deep_drive: it was 2 dollars per tip
[2017-05-31 05:10:36 UTC] unoriginaldavid: I'm off, bye chat see you tomorrow
[2017-05-31 05:10:43 UTC] deep_drive: see ya david

[2017-05-31 05:10:57 UTC] deep_drive: bye d1mech
[2017-05-31 05:11:05 UTC] d1mech: bye deep
[2017-05-31 05:11:13 UTC] thirdeyethethird: wait, can you use payapl to tip on twitch, i'm tired of buying these stupid bits
[2017-05-31 05:11:15 UTC] ellietsantiara: Mort = VoteNay
[2017-05-31 05:11:15 UTC] deep_drive: hes gonna have a paparazzi
[2017-05-31 05:11:28 UTC] micgelo09: well yeah all sok is actually doing is pointing out what phil is doing wrong meanwhile their fans are shitting on phil withou a decent argument and then phi'ls fans are doing the same thing to sok
[2017-05-31 05:11:39 UTC] deep_drive: https://u.muxy.io/tip/darksydephil
[2017-05-31 05:11:47 UTC] deep_drive: its set up indpendently of twitch i think
[2017-05-31 05:11:56 UTC] deep_drive: but you get on screen notification and all that jazz
[2017-05-31 05:12:09 UTC] yaslothy: *yawns*
[2017-05-31 05:12:26 UTC] micgelo09: and email notifications
[2017-05-31 05:12:31 UTC] thirdeyethethird: thanks @Deep_Drive tired of doing all that crap through amazon and cc
[2017-05-31 05:12:40 UTC] ellietsantiara: @micgelo09 There is no logic in the hate from these assholes towards Phil, I mean the SoK think he's some sort of evil Hitler or something
[2017-05-31 05:13:08 UTC] micgelo09: no no no phil thinks that's the issues
[2017-05-31 05:13:34 UTC] micgelo09: let me ask u a question @EllietSantiAra have you actually seen a video from their side?
[2017-05-31 05:13:47 UTC] deep_drive: I will say that sok is over the top and misconscrues phil but it's best not to have a discussion about hater groups...it just gives them free advertisement
[2017-05-31 05:13:52 UTC] kekon3: Who started the movement
[2017-05-31 05:13:59 UTC] thirdeyethethird: i've seen most of SoK material, and I tune into their podcasts
[2017-05-31 05:14:02 UTC] ellietsantiara: I did once and it's always the same shit. They always contradict themselves
[2017-05-31 05:14:06 UTC] thirdeyethethird: I think it's hilarious
[2017-05-31 05:14:24 UTC] thirdeyethethird: only reason i know of dsp is because of tihydp
[2017-05-31 05:14:37 UTC] thirdeyethethird: i support both
[2017-05-31 05:14:37 UTC] micgelo09: im not promoting anything im just saying their is a big misunderstanding its the fans spewing nonsense not the fans themselves
[2017-05-31 05:14:41 UTC] ellietsantiara: They slam Phil for being "racist", yet they've sent me racist hate messages out of nowhere... uh hypocrites much?
[2017-05-31 05:15:08 UTC] micgelo09: when have they slammed phil
[2017-05-31 05:15:18 UTC] thirdeyethethird: but i'm also not a dumbass who would shit on phil just to do so, theat hate and animosity is for children
[2017-05-31 05:15:20 UTC] micgelo09: and what do you mean by slammed?
[2017-05-31 05:15:55 UTC] ellietsantiara: They make 4 hour long videos about every thing he says
[2017-05-31 05:16:24 UTC] ellietsantiara: Also, the same SoK member just sent me another racist message
[2017-05-31 05:16:25 UTC] thirdeyethethird: they mostly cover tihydp videos
[2017-05-31 05:16:26 UTC] micgelo09: and when they actually provide arguements about what he's doing
[2017-05-31 05:16:39 UTC] sanguinenite: @EllietSantiAra Exactly, they are the Ultimate Hypocrites
[2017-05-31 05:16:53 UTC] micgelo09: where's the proof that says sok themselves just slam phil
[2017-05-31 05:16:58 UTC] kekon3: about "what he's doing
[2017-05-31 05:17:02 UTC] micgelo09: i watch it from both sides
[2017-05-31 05:17:03 UTC] kekon3: "what he's doing"
[2017-05-31 05:17:07 UTC] deep_drive: thats all they do Micgelo09
[2017-05-31 05:17:16 UTC] micgelo09: both from phil and sok
[2017-05-31 05:17:26 UTC] ellietsantiara: Any video pretty much on the SoK channel
[2017-05-31 05:17:41 UTC] micgelo09: no the tihydp
[2017-05-31 05:17:45 UTC] sanguinenite: The only advice I give the trolls is - Ask your parents to send you to a mental hospital for some counseling, it might help
[2017-05-31 05:18:06 UTC] ellietsantiara: and even if they didn't "slam" him that way, they still literally dedicate hours of their lives to simply say he is a shit person or whatever
[2017-05-31 05:18:27 UTC] ellietsantiara: and that itself is messed up. These people need help
[2017-05-31 05:18:29 UTC] micgelo09: im on neither side im just seeing where this whole shitshow is going
[2017-05-31 05:18:40 UTC] ellietsantiara: They are obsessed with him
[2017-05-31 05:18:50 UTC] sanguinenite: yeah they need Jesus to get the demon possessing them out of them
[2017-05-31 05:18:52 UTC] ellietsantiara: Regardless of what Phil does
[2017-05-31 05:18:59 UTC] darksydephil: You do realize the SOK are the reason the shitshow exists and continues, right? They're the instigators. I just sit here and play games
[2017-05-31 05:19:17 UTC] micgelo09: im not talking about you yourself
[2017-05-31 05:19:19 UTC] darksydephil: You don't find videos or streams about drama shit unless it's absolutely necessary. That's ALL they put out
[2017-05-31 05:19:39 UTC] micgelo09: im talking about some of your fans blowing shit out of proprtion
[2017-05-31 05:19:43 UTC] yaslothy: uh oh
[2017-05-31 05:20:00 UTC] darksydephil: why do you think the fans do it? because the SOK start it and continue with it. It will never end until they grow the fuck up and move on from this nonsense
[2017-05-31 05:20:10 UTC] thirdeyethethird: it's entertainment, it doesn't hurt you phil. reasonable people know that there's two sides to a coin and they can see bothe of them if they stay on the rim
[2017-05-31 05:20:29 UTC] thirdeyethethird: morons will choose a tribe and stick with it
[2017-05-31 05:20:39 UTC] micgelo09: it really a battle between your dsp and sok
[2017-05-31 05:20:43 UTC] sanguinenite: entertainment? Shitting on someone to get fame? That is some TMZ shit right there @thirdeyethethird
[2017-05-31 05:20:46 UTC] darksydephil: Yeah, it's entertainment TO YOU. it's my fucking life and so many things have been fucked up because of this bullshit that has nothing to do with my daily gaming streams/videos. and it has to fucking stop at some point
[2017-05-31 05:21:40 UTC] thirdeyethethird: yeah i can see it from your side, tishydp is one thing, going after your personal life is crossing the line imo
[2017-05-31 05:21:46 UTC] kekon3: reasonable people would reel in their audience and slap them on the wrist for being as vile as they can get
[2017-05-31 05:21:49 UTC] ellietsantiara: And even if they want to give their personal opinion, that's one thing. But going as far as doing false copyright strikes, making blog sites and comploting against him, his family that is just messed up and their reasons don't even make sense . they are obsessed with him because their lives are so pathetic they NEED him to feel they are something more than insignificant and mentally ill microbes
[2017-05-31 05:21:58 UTC] darksydephil: how do you think i'll ever get a job anywhere when as soon as they go to do an internet search, they see a million videos saying i'm a pedophile, a masturbated on stream, and i mistreat my girlfriend? and then they go out of their way to try and ruin my livelihood by lying to MCNs/attacking them and/or anyone associated with me business wise. so i can't get a job other than youtube/twitch but they try to destroy my youtube/twitch as well. it's COMPLETELY fucked
[2017-05-31 05:22:12 UTC] yaslothy: PogChamp
[2017-05-31 05:22:29 UTC] micgelo09: sok didnt hack u (their fans did) dsp didnt put gas in the fire dsp's fans did
[2017-05-31 05:22:31 UTC] thirdeyethethird: the thing with these kind of groups is that it becomes a tribe, and in this case the majority of the tribe are dumb young kids who want to shit on everything
[2017-05-31 05:22:32 UTC] sanguinenite: Oh shit....
[2017-05-31 05:23:00 UTC] thirdeyethethird: atleast once a day someone whispers me to tell you something nasty with a cheer, or they straight up send death threats to you to me
[2017-05-31 05:23:18 UTC] micgelo09: its the fans fueling the flame of nonsense not you not sok JUST THE FANS
[2017-05-31 05:23:26 UTC] darksydephil: you can only blame the parents. lazy, good for nothing fucks who just popped out kids and never taught them morals. so they think its perfectly OKAY to destroy someone's life on the internet for theri own jollies, because there's no reprecussions to them. i wouldn't be able to sleep at night knowing i was doing something like that
[2017-05-31 05:23:45 UTC] thirdeyethethird: how fucking bad does your homelife have to be that you want someone dead that you have never even met before
[2017-05-31 05:23:52 UTC] sanguinenite: I agree, a lot of pieces of shit are breeding more pieces of shit in this world
[2017-05-31 05:24:01 UTC] micgelo09: yeah sadly
[2017-05-31 05:24:07 UTC] ellietsantiara: @thirdeyethethird Same as me, the same SoK guy keeps sending me racist messages, and telling me to "grow up". Coming from some kid that is obsessed with a man that did nothing wrong to him FailFish
[2017-05-31 05:24:07 UTC] sanguinenite: we need another Great Flood to cleanse the planet
[2017-05-31 05:24:41 UTC] deep_drive: just block them
[2017-05-31 05:24:47 UTC] yaslothy: lol
[2017-05-31 05:24:54 UTC] deep_drive: like i said best to not give them more attention
[2017-05-31 05:24:57 UTC] darksydephil: it's as ive said before, simply put: there are too many humans on earth for every life to be meaningful. and when your life has no meaning, you seek to make it mean something. so if the only impactful thing you can possibly do in your life is ruin someone else's life from behind your computer, you'll do it so you feel like you had some kind of impact on something. otherwise, you're nothing. that's the situation this "tribe" is in
[2017-05-31 05:25:29 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yeah, that is why I don't respond to those messages. I Just laugh at how pathetic that kid's lie Is
[2017-05-31 05:25:33 UTC] darksydephil: the vast majority of people who dislike me on the internet do so because they actually believe some lie about me that isn't true or is a half-truth, and sounds awful out of context. and i have no defense at all to any of it
[2017-05-31 05:25:57 UTC] masterwarlord: I personally find the whole saga of trolls really funny and it's the main reason I watch. A lot of your fans come from THIYDPs. The people who want to see you stop streaming at any cost are pathetic though. Like, why are they so invested in this? At best it should just be something funny to watch.
[2017-05-31 05:26:02 UTC] sanguinenite: @Deep_Drive We are not giving the trolls attention - We are trying to point out the real reason they do what they do. Because only by looking at the ROOT cause of their issues will the trolling ever stop and will the trolls ever get a real life
[2017-05-31 05:26:30 UTC] darksydephil: they won't stop until they find something else meaningful in their lives to spend their time on. I'll give you an example: DarksideGeoff
[2017-05-31 05:26:42 UTC] micgelo09: the problem is that both sides also dont see things in their viewpoint sok thinks phil had some issues that need to be taken care of and phil's fans think oh "nothing is wrong with phil in general " and fuel the fire even more
[2017-05-31 05:26:49 UTC] sanguinenite: Who's DarksideGeoff?
[2017-05-31 05:27:04 UTC] darksydephil: he used to bea huge troll of mine, made slanderous lie vids about me back in the days of SF4 etc. but he got a life, a job, grew up and now i've had meaningful convos with him. he realized what he did was wrong and how bad it's gotten with this new group and apologized to me for it
[2017-05-31 05:27:09 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yeah and most of the haters and detractors come.from seeing those videos.The SoK says something, and the kids automatically believe it. Long Time fans know Phil and how he has changed over the years, and know when they are Full of shit
[2017-05-31 05:27:10 UTC] thirdeyethethird: maybe pull back the curtain on your personal life more phil
[2017-05-31 05:27:33 UTC] dhizzykidd: Ah shit am I too late for the stream? 😂😂
[2017-05-31 05:27:39 UTC] yaslothy: EleGiggle
[2017-05-31 05:27:48 UTC] thirdeyethethird: and i know you're doing that by not mentioning the car u got
[2017-05-31 05:27:57 UTC] dhizzykidd: What'd I miss? :/
[2017-05-31 05:28:00 UTC] darksydephil: or how about DasBoSchitt who was a HUUUUGE critic of mine, even made skit videos about what i was doing was wrong on YT. but then talked with me, saw i wanted to improve and DID improve, and completely changed his attitude. shit he's a patron of mine
[2017-05-31 05:28:27 UTC] kekon3: I see Dasboschitt in the credits, made me happy
[2017-05-31 05:29:11 UTC] sanguinenite: I am happy that I was never a demon possessed troll of phil. Seems a lot of people go thru a phase of bullying phil and grow out of it
[2017-05-31 05:29:22 UTC] micgelo09: if they actually provided a arguement instead of spewing nonsense that would be a bit more understandable but hey guess i'll just say shit that's not true about you on stream FailFish
[2017-05-31 05:30:48 UTC] masterwarlord: Is it still the best for the youtube algorithm to upload lots of short videos instead of fewer long ones? It has annoyed subscribers.
[2017-05-31 05:31:10 UTC] dhizzykidd: Bro I just have to say Phil puts in work :) Everyday he's grinding and I have mad respect for him
[2017-05-31 05:31:14 UTC] kekon3: yeah, pretty much 10 minutes is still the sweetspot
[2017-05-31 05:31:17 UTC] ellietsantiara: I can empathize, because I know what it is to be a shit person and have everyone hate you, and have to change for the good of myself and my family, and gone through many changes in my way of being.Phil inspired me in that area and also made me believe that people have the opportunity to change and improve, no matter their mistakes in the past
[2017-05-31 05:31:30 UTC] kekon3: GameGrumps know this, their videos are short because of this, but they also stagger their uploads hard
[2017-05-31 05:31:39 UTC] damiennoctis: Considering the algorithm changes all the time, I'm not sure how important it is or will be MasterWarlord
[2017-05-31 05:31:55 UTC] darksydephil: it WAS about video length for like 2 years
[2017-05-31 05:32:01 UTC] darksydephil: it just recently changed last year to engagement rate
[2017-05-31 05:32:09 UTC] darksydephil: so, what % of your vids actually gets watched
[2017-05-31 05:32:16 UTC] darksydephil: the shorter the vid, the higher chance for higher engagement
[2017-05-31 05:32:41 UTC] ellietsantiara: lol wtf why does it say link deleted I never posted link
[2017-05-31 05:33:07 UTC] micgelo09: @Dhizzykidd not exactly he might run 3 channels but its not like he's other stream (me 4 example ) that normally stream alot long er 9+ hours and he does unedited videos (not hrs of editing on 20 videos ) just pressing upload dude
[2017-05-31 05:33:37 UTC] yaslothy: OpieOP
[2017-05-31 05:33:57 UTC] deep_drive: you probably put words right after a period instead of a space EllietSantiAra
[2017-05-31 05:34:09 UTC] deep_drive: nightbot sometime picks up on that but I don't see any deleted link
[2017-05-31 05:34:26 UTC] darksydephil: yeah we didnt' see it on our end
[2017-05-31 05:34:37 UTC] yaslothy: well this was interesting
[2017-05-31 05:35:09 UTC] micgelo09: not like that's a problem but dont make it seem like its hard to stream for 2-5 hrs and make it seem like phil puts an entire day into gaming like other unappreciated streamers
[2017-05-31 05:35:25 UTC] ellietsantiara: @micgelo09 Actually back in the 08-09 era walk through videos were very popular, a lot of gamers like it that way and most youtubers never uploaded edited content like they do these days, they do that because they mainly upload for younger audiences But short videos was always DSP style and we kinda prefered it
[2017-05-31 05:35:48 UTC] sanguinenite: Who cares about video length when you watch it in a playlist on youtube?
[2017-05-31 05:36:10 UTC] ellietsantiara: @deep_drive Yeah that is what I though, this phone keyboard and spelling checker sucks lol
[2017-05-31 05:36:28 UTC] sanguinenite: I will never type out comments using a phone ever
[2017-05-31 05:36:32 UTC] micgelo09: i know but dont make it seem like he's putting in so much more effort than other people when you do unedited videos @EllietSantiAra
[2017-05-31 05:36:42 UTC] damiennoctis: I don't know, I've never really cared about a video's lengths when watching full length let's plays
[2017-05-31 05:36:59 UTC] masterwarlord: The reason people do not like it is flooding subbox with 40 two minute Injustice videos. I am subscribed to more people than just DSP. I understand why he does it, of course.
[2017-05-31 05:37:31 UTC] yaslothy: If I had to pick a perfect time length for a gameplay video it would be 20-25 mins
[2017-05-31 05:37:52 UTC] darksydephil: Micgelo09 : it's about the overall body of work. I've individually played more games and created more playthroughs than any one person on the internet. Sure, you can argue that they edit their videos and therefore more effort goes into each individual vid. But that's never what I've been about. I work just as hard, if not HARDER, than the video editor guys. They have a ton of style and far less substance than what I put out, so tos peak.
[2017-05-31 05:38:13 UTC] micgelo09: apparently i can barely get 1 person to watch 15 min
[2017-05-31 05:38:25 UTC] nin10dont: that's what you call editing?
[2017-05-31 05:38:26 UTC] sanguinenite: I am subscribed to over 1000 channels, my invoice aint flooded with shit.
[2017-05-31 05:38:38 UTC] yaslothy: 1000 channels? PogChamp
[2017-05-31 05:38:43 UTC] ellietsantiara: @micgelo09 You're forgetting that mosto of those youtuber have a team of editors or at least an extra person that edits their videos, like Jacksepticeye for example. Phil works alone so it is his own effort when it comes to the uploading, the recording, streaming and I'm pretty sure there's more to it. I'd have no idea how to run a LiveStream let alone mantain 3 channels by myself
[2017-05-31 05:39:24 UTC] sanguinenite: @YaSlothy I am exagerrating but keep in mind that I have been on youtube for years since 2009, of course I would have come across many other channels which I subbed to because I liked them
[2017-05-31 05:39:52 UTC] micgelo09: @DarksydePhil im not saying you dont put in effort but its just that people overexaggerate who you r in generall i'll be honest im not the best at gaming either but i sure as hell am not the worst
[2017-05-31 05:40:09 UTC] yaslothy: @sanguinenite oh, well I have about 50 I subscribe to..some over the years I've unsubbed but I still have my main core of people I watch
[2017-05-31 05:40:15 UTC] nin10dont: what are you gonna do in a year? 3 years? 10? Still playing games?
[2017-05-31 05:40:25 UTC] sanguinenite: I remember a time when Youtube's history log was 10000
[2017-05-31 05:40:36 UTC] sanguinenite: Now it is 5000 or 7000 I think
[2017-05-31 05:40:36 UTC] micgelo09: not saying your the worst just saying every1 makes us seem like what were not
[2017-05-31 05:40:37 UTC] thirdeyethethird: best not to compare who works harder. that's a slippery slide down the shit rope
[2017-05-31 05:40:39 UTC] deep_drive: How do you have time to watch over 1000 channels worth of videos?
[2017-05-31 05:40:47 UTC] yaslothy: I've been on YT since 2005 but didn't seriously use it until 2007/2008
[2017-05-31 05:41:02 UTC] thirdeyethethird: stay humble and do what you can
[2017-05-31 05:41:13 UTC] ellietsantiara: @nin10dont I don't see video games dying anytime in the near future, less with the technologies becoming basic part of our existance
[2017-05-31 05:41:32 UTC] sanguinenite: Keep in mind, I hate movies so youtube became the replacement
[2017-05-31 05:41:50 UTC] sanguinenite: of all my main video entertainment sources
[2017-05-31 05:42:28 UTC] thirdeyethethird: I'd like to seriously know if anyone has a fucking clue where they will be in 10 years and what they will be doing. That's a bullshit question
[2017-05-31 05:42:54 UTC] darthvidarviking: @thirdeyethethird pretty much
[2017-05-31 05:43:02 UTC] sanguinenite: No one can say where they will be in 10 years unless they are god or in a situation where there is no hope
[2017-05-31 05:43:17 UTC] thirdeyethethird: 10 years ago I was a drug addict and alcoholic, I didn't think I'd be here with a job, sober, and happy
[2017-05-31 05:43:19 UTC] micgelo09: their is a fine line between humble and 3 yrs of gaming with no real change or viwership yeah its all about the interaction but whats the point if no1 is interacting?
[2017-05-31 05:43:21 UTC] deep_drive: unless you are in prison sanguinenite
[2017-05-31 05:43:26 UTC] ellietsantiara: YouTube and DSPGaming is basically the only entertainment in my life. I quit TV years ago, the shows I like I watch them online. Movies are meh, maybe once in a while some Netflix n Chill or wait till the movie comes out on dvd
[2017-05-31 05:43:42 UTC] micgelo09: anime?
[2017-05-31 05:43:48 UTC] micgelo09: WATCH it
[2017-05-31 05:44:10 UTC] leonaras: Attack on titan is worth watching Kappa
[2017-05-31 05:44:39 UTC] ellietsantiara: The only anime I like was Sword Art, Evangelion and DragonBall back in the day
[2017-05-31 05:44:42 UTC] sanguinenite: @Deep_Drive unless they are in prison. 10 years you probably know where you will be lol
[2017-05-31 05:45:09 UTC] masterwarlord: What are DSP's favorite animus, this is highly important.
[2017-05-31 05:45:16 UTC] leonaras: Hi Aegislash, you are the bestest pokemon.
[2017-05-31 05:45:27 UTC] micgelo09: i was hoping phil would play competitive on overwatch
[2017-05-31 05:45:33 UTC] yaslothy: welp
[2017-05-31 05:45:49 UTC] micgelo09: let him experience the cancer that is bronze
[2017-05-31 05:45:51 UTC] yaslothy: time for bed...everyone take care of each other
[2017-05-31 05:45:57 UTC] deep_drive: good night YaSlothy
[2017-05-31 05:46:14 UTC] yaslothy: Night :)
[2017-05-31 05:46:20 UTC] micgelo09: k
[2017-05-31 05:46:21 UTC] sanguinenite: Night Yacherdy
[2017-05-31 05:46:33 UTC] yaslothy: KonCha
[2017-05-31 05:46:37 UTC] thirdeyethethird: I don't follow anyone on twitch except for Phil (cleavage streamers don't count) because he's a funny dude, whether I laugh with him or at him, you can't have one. Maybe he sprinkles a little bullshit when he blames the game, so, I sprinkle a little bullshit in my life if it suits me. other streamers don't have the drama, the excitement and the humor that comes with DSP
[2017-05-31 05:46:38 UTC] dhizzykidd: Peace love and happiness y'all! Good night
[2017-05-31 05:47:13 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yeah me too, I gotta go work at the school tomorrow and I haven't even checked the class schedule lol, goodnight everyone, cya guys tomorrow for more GOTY Friday the 13th PogChamp
[2017-05-31 05:47:18 UTC] deep_drive: I follow other people (mainly people from phils chat) but i hardly ever watch anyone besides phil
[2017-05-31 05:47:26 UTC] sanguinenite: The reason I follow Phil is because he isnt fake and pretentious like the other youtubers, cant stand it
[2017-05-31 05:48:02 UTC] thirdeyethethird: I do miss the dsp from when he recorded his plays on cam. he was more talkative
[2017-05-31 05:48:05 UTC] leonaras: @sanguinenite i take it you are new to phils content
[2017-05-31 05:48:07 UTC] micgelo09: meh i can sympathise with that but phil at times does some cringeworthy shit
[2017-05-31 05:48:10 UTC] sanguinenite: @Deep_Drive That's because most of us have another day job, not everyone can be a full time youtuber
[2017-05-31 05:48:24 UTC] deep_drive: I started following Phil because I couldn't find anyone else doing actual playthroughs of games for the most part...they were edited in some way
[2017-05-31 05:48:24 UTC] sanguinenite: No, I have been watching Phil's content since late 2010
[2017-05-31 05:49:10 UTC] sanguinenite: @Leonaras btw, I know you are that other LeoKira996 person
[2017-05-31 05:49:14 UTC] micgelo09: meh i can sympathise with that but phil at times does some cringeworthy shit remember weeks later after that masturbation incident he was still making those cringe worthy jokes
[2017-05-31 05:49:28 UTC] leonaras: @Sanguinite i am? o.O whos that
[2017-05-31 05:49:38 UTC] sanguinenite: it hardly matters
[2017-05-31 05:49:39 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yeah back then he always talked funny shit every 5 seconds lol it was classic Phil but he's still very enjoyable to this day
[2017-05-31 05:49:41 UTC] thirdeyethethird: we all masturbate
[2017-05-31 05:49:47 UTC] sanguinenite: but you know who you are
[2017-05-31 05:49:56 UTC] thirdeyethethird: the fact that people can't let that go
[2017-05-31 05:50:05 UTC] thirdeyethethird: is silly
[2017-05-31 05:50:26 UTC] micgelo09: the guy eating popcorn slowly watching the fan wars and eating popcorn while doing it
[2017-05-31 05:50:30 UTC] deep_drive: well back in the wild west of youtube you could get away with more stuff...for instance i don't think he'd be able to bring back the friend request ridicule nowadays
[2017-05-31 05:50:30 UTC] sanguinenite: honestly, I want a politican that can be honest like phil and admit that they did an accident on stream
[2017-05-31 05:50:41 UTC] thirdeyethethird: also, people with green nicknames are going to make me go blind one day
[2017-05-31 05:51:14 UTC] leonaras: @sanguinenite wasnt he scratching his leg?
[2017-05-31 05:51:15 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yeah I know like it's ridiculous how people think it's a big deal when it's really not. They exxagerate remember that douche the other day
[2017-05-31 05:51:18 UTC] micgelo09: cant help it its not like i can change my nickname color
[2017-05-31 05:52:07 UTC] thirdeyethethird: there's bullying and there's something else, but let's not call it bullying
[2017-05-31 05:52:12 UTC] sanguinenite: Phil admitted that he had an "accident" so I will take it that it happened. I dont really care if he actually masturbated since we will never know that unless we actually saw his "equipment" on stream XD
[2017-05-31 05:52:24 UTC] deep_drive: unfortunately i hate to say it, but blowing a small thing out of proportion has become a huge part of society nowadays
[2017-05-31 05:52:36 UTC] deep_drive: especially if its sjw related
[2017-05-31 05:52:53 UTC] thirdeyethethird: that fad (sjw) can't die sooner
[2017-05-31 05:53:09 UTC] ellietsantiara: He masturbated, he didn't, who cares, it was funny, it happened over a year ago, not important anymore lol but the creeps can't let it go
[2017-05-31 05:53:43 UTC] leonaras: @Deep_Dive cmon deep, dont say that about phil, im sure its huge. Kappa
[2017-05-31 05:53:45 UTC] thirdeyethethird: because it's fun to bully people and ridicule them if that's what you're used to doing
[2017-05-31 05:54:39 UTC] micgelo09: instead constant trolling just have an actual argument
[2017-05-31 05:54:52 UTC] micgelo09: dont just spew nonsense to troll on stream
[2017-05-31 05:55:05 UTC] ellietsantiara: All SJW'S are hypocrites though, they want you to respect their opinions but if you have different opinion they bully the shit out of you
[2017-05-31 05:55:12 UTC] thirdeyethethird: people need their kicks
[2017-05-31 05:55:29 UTC] thirdeyethethird: and for some that's how they get theirs
[2017-05-31 05:55:47 UTC] ellietsantiara: And those dicks are born when their parents don't beat the fuck out of them when they become rebels
[2017-05-31 05:55:49 UTC] deep_drive: well his haters are a byproduct of this new sjw culture
[2017-05-31 05:55:54 UTC] micgelo09: @EllietSantiAra at a time wasnt that phil'?
[2017-05-31 05:56:09 UTC] thirdeyethethird: i was a kid once, I remember how good it felt to pick on someone who had no friends, or they had a weak voice
[2017-05-31 05:56:19 UTC] thirdeyethethird: anything really, just to feel superior
[2017-05-31 05:56:25 UTC] leonaras: Yeah but technically, arent the people vehemently defending phil more SJWs than the hater community?
[2017-05-31 05:56:25 UTC] thirdeyethethird: some grow out of it, some dont
[2017-05-31 05:56:25 UTC] ellietsantiara: @micgelo09 Keyword : W A S
[2017-05-31 05:57:14 UTC] deep_drive: i wouldn't say so Leonaras...ok there might be a few extremists here and there
[2017-05-31 05:57:15 UTC] ellietsantiara: past tense, he's not like that anymore but the haters don't seem to understand that people have the right and capacity yo change. and Phil has changed and improved as a person
[2017-05-31 05:57:34 UTC] thirdeyethethird: well, anyone who's a die hard fanatic phil that would spew hate FOR him is about as intelligent as the "detractors"
[2017-05-31 05:58:02 UTC] thirdeyethethird: of phil*
[2017-05-31 05:58:37 UTC] micgelo09: the hard core fans (mostly) spew up shit to piss off sok then the fans get pissed and do the same but to dsp not the fans
[2017-05-31 05:58:38 UTC] thirdeyethethird: idiots in both tribes
[2017-05-31 05:58:40 UTC] leonaras: @Deep_Drive there are extremes on both sides of the argument. At the end of the day the best thing phil can do is not react to shit he gets, but im not sure hes entirely capable of it.
[2017-05-31 05:58:59 UTC] micgelo09: exactly
[2017-05-31 05:59:19 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yeah, and as I've said in a stream the other day,here where I live we have a saying: Listening to an asshole just makes him bigger. So instead of white knighting, it's better to just ignore them psychos
[2017-05-31 05:59:56 UTC] micgelo09: both sides are shitting on each other and the main ceo of each (channel) is being punished for it
[2017-05-31 06:00:00 UTC] deep_drive: well if it comes up its good to address if someone says something thats not true about you
[2017-05-31 06:00:24 UTC] thirdeyethethird: there's a strange symbiosis betwen dsp and sok, sok would not have content without dsp, dsp would not have as much entertainment without sok
[2017-05-31 06:00:28 UTC] ellietsantiara: Well maybe the leader of the SoK should call of his/her useless crusade
[2017-05-31 06:00:30 UTC] micgelo09: bet you didnt know sok get hacked numerous times to by phil fans ......huh?
[2017-05-31 06:00:44 UTC] thirdeyethethird: ultimately, they drive viewers to him
[2017-05-31 06:01:08 UTC] thirdeyethethird: wether those viewers are decent human beings who can see both sides of a coin is another thing
[2017-05-31 06:01:13 UTC] micgelo09: ya think phil is the only 1 that's being shit on? no that's wrong
[2017-05-31 06:01:23 UTC] deep_drive: well he can do just fine without them...but they require him
[2017-05-31 06:01:38 UTC] leonaras: Yeah but phil has stated in the past he doesnt want that kind of viewer. But that kind of viewer is his " majority " other than his core fanbase
[2017-05-31 06:02:07 UTC] deep_drive: his core fanbase is his majority though
[2017-05-31 06:02:08 UTC] ellietsantiara: @micgelo09 They shouldn't have to shit on absolutely anyone, in any case there's people on YouTube that actually deserve it, like Keemstar
[2017-05-31 06:02:13 UTC] thirdeyethethird: SoK is the leech in the relationship sure
[2017-05-31 06:02:42 UTC] ellietsantiara: Whoa guys hold on there was an earthquake
[2017-05-31 06:02:43 UTC] micgelo09: i keep saying its fans that take it to far not the channels but hey not like any1 listens to me i guess im a phil fanboy and sok member lol
[2017-05-31 06:02:44 UTC] ellietsantiara: shit
[2017-05-31 06:03:30 UTC] ellietsantiara: okay it passed, damn
[2017-05-31 06:03:35 UTC] deep_drive: hope you're ok EllietSantiAra
[2017-05-31 06:03:43 UTC] thirdeyethethird: where you at @EllietSantiAra
[2017-05-31 06:03:48 UTC] ellietsantiara: I'm okay but I did feel that
[2017-05-31 06:03:50 UTC] micgelo09: i both sides stop the drama will end with it if one attacks a cub the mother bear will protect their cub
[2017-05-31 06:04:04 UTC] deep_drive: be careful now the haters are gonna track you based on when you said the earthquake was Kappa
[2017-05-31 06:04:09 UTC] micgelo09: if not i
[2017-05-31 06:04:12 UTC] ellietsantiara: I live in a city near the East Coast of Mexico
[2017-05-31 06:05:04 UTC] ellietsantiara: HAHAHA let them come! Might be easy getting in but good luck getting out of this country alive!
[2017-05-31 06:05:09 UTC] thirdeyethethird: I used to live in asia where we had 6 and 7 on the scale. fun times
[2017-05-31 06:05:31 UTC] thirdeyethethird: lol
[2017-05-31 06:05:56 UTC] thirdeyethethird: tomorrow we see Phil's new mcn is connected to the mexican cartel
[2017-05-31 06:05:56 UTC] ellietsantiara: If not, I will welcome them with my lovely hospitality and some lead from my Glock
[2017-05-31 06:06:04 UTC] thirdeyethethird: sudeenly no one is mocking him
[2017-05-31 06:06:12 UTC] micgelo09: i live in (prince of bel air music plays) DEEP SOUTH born and raised
[2017-05-31 06:06:13 UTC] deep_drive: i think most of the bickering is done between phil fanboys and fervent hater supporters
[2017-05-31 06:06:27 UTC] micgelo09: in my house gaming for the rest of my dayz
[2017-05-31 06:06:37 UTC] thirdeyethethird: yeah the lowest of the low idiots from both tribes
[2017-05-31 06:06:38 UTC] deep_drive: and the person who bears it all is the one making the content ie Phil
[2017-05-31 06:07:20 UTC] deep_drive: but thats the reason why there is so much tension
[2017-05-31 06:07:24 UTC] micgelo09: @thirdeyethethird sure buddy im the idot
[2017-05-31 06:07:34 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yeah, there's shitty fans on both sides. Mostly kids who don't know how to make an argument except do insults and racist slams
[2017-05-31 06:07:47 UTC] thirdeyethethird: @Micgelo09 we weren't talking? when did i call you an idiot?
[2017-05-31 06:07:58 UTC] leonaras: Still say phil made a mistake getting a brand new car.
[2017-05-31 06:08:09 UTC] micgelo09: my bad sry im a bit defensive at time
[2017-05-31 06:08:16 UTC] micgelo09: (s)
[2017-05-31 06:08:17 UTC] thirdeyethethird: uhh ok
[2017-05-31 06:08:51 UTC] micgelo09: @EllietSantiAra i have been saying that forever
[2017-05-31 06:09:20 UTC] thirdeyethethird: kids will be kids, we all went through that awkward time
[2017-05-31 06:09:21 UTC] micgelo09: sok didnt hack phil theawsome1 did
[2017-05-31 06:09:37 UTC] deep_drive: beawesomeone?
[2017-05-31 06:09:47 UTC] ellietsantiara: @leonaras Phil has the freed to do with his life as he sees fits, not as the haters or trolls want to see him. No one has the right to judge if him buying a new car is a bad decision or not, only Phil can judge that because that's his life.
[2017-05-31 06:09:48 UTC] micgelo09: whatever his username was
[2017-05-31 06:10:32 UTC] micgelo09: @EllietSantiAra dats debatable
[2017-05-31 06:10:45 UTC] deep_drive: he pmed me trying to get me to unban him and admitted to giving phil a false copyright strike in the same sentence that he said theres no evidence that it was him
[2017-05-31 06:11:00 UTC] micgelo09: he says he's in mountains of debt but we see videos of him getting new shit
[2017-05-31 06:11:28 UTC] ellietsantiara: No its not, understand that it's his money, his car and his life.
[2017-05-31 06:11:33 UTC] thirdeyethethird: i have a mountain of debt and i still buy stuff
[2017-05-31 06:11:37 UTC] leonaras: @EllietSantiAra Aye but the logic he used is flawed. 0% interest loans are good if you can keep them up and pay them off before their end. If something goes wrong in those 6 years and you take a bit longer, that 0% becomes an inflated interest over the entire period. Considering phils circumstances i dont think its wise to make a gamble on something that requires security to be a good deal.
[2017-05-31 06:12:03 UTC] micgelo09: we didnt tell him to move to seattle that was his choice
[2017-05-31 06:12:04 UTC] thirdeyethethird: who doesn't have debt lol, oh right children don't have debt
[2017-05-31 06:12:25 UTC] ellietsantiara: Well for the last 4 months he's Ben OK economically it seems, so I think he's getting more stable in that area
[2017-05-31 06:13:15 UTC] ellietsantiara: exactly that was his choice and if that was a good or bad one is his decision, not anyone else's.
[2017-05-31 06:13:27 UTC] thirdeyethethird: someone pm'd me that Leanna left Phil?
[2017-05-31 06:13:40 UTC] ellietsantiara: When?
[2017-05-31 06:13:43 UTC] thirdeyethethird: more bs i'm assuming
[2017-05-31 06:13:46 UTC] deep_drive: just ignore em EllietSantiAra
[2017-05-31 06:13:51 UTC] leonaras: Not to mention he used getting " equity " against the value of the car was a thing, which is technically false. You drive that car off the lot and it loses a large chunk of value. And standard depreciation on a vehicles value would make any form of " equity " a moot point. I mean if it was a house, yeah but...
[2017-05-31 06:13:53 UTC] deep_drive: or thirdeyethethird
[2017-05-31 06:13:57 UTC] deep_drive: oops
[2017-05-31 06:14:11 UTC] deep_drive: just baseless claims
[2017-05-31 06:14:38 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yeah, it's probably something they made up in their little kiddie blogs chats
[2017-05-31 06:14:47 UTC] micgelo09: corruption is a bitch huh Kappa
[2017-05-31 06:15:37 UTC] micgelo09: basically
[2017-05-31 06:15:39 UTC] ellietsantiara: Well to be honest I don't know much about car sales or how economy works in the US, but I think Phil has learned enough and we'll to manage his economy
[2017-05-31 06:15:53 UTC] ellietsantiara: *well
[2017-05-31 06:16:34 UTC] leonaras: If he was manging his economy well he wouldnt make emergency vlogs every few weeks
[2017-05-31 06:17:32 UTC] deep_drive: Well it was because youtube dropped significantly in their ad rev
[2017-05-31 06:17:44 UTC] ellietsantiara: He did accept that he wasted a lot of money on useless shit like statues and collectibles and now he pays the concequences of that, so I think and believe he now has the proper knowledge to know if buying a new car is good for his life or not. Regardless, we are no one to judge that
[2017-05-31 06:18:14 UTC] leonaras: PSVR at this point is also a revenue brick.
[2017-05-31 06:18:16 UTC] thirdeyethethird: deep_dive are you friends with Phil irl? I've been assuming that all the mods on here are close to him
[2017-05-31 06:18:24 UTC] ellietsantiara: Because those are his decisions and his life
[2017-05-31 06:18:33 UTC] micgelo09: and what about the whole not paying the guys that helped with project 7
[2017-05-31 06:18:57 UTC] micgelo09: then them seeing him with new shit
[2017-05-31 06:19:00 UTC] deep_drive: no we don't really visit hiim thirdeyethethird
[2017-05-31 06:19:36 UTC] thirdeyethethird: not a even a bbq once a year or something
[2017-05-31 06:20:35 UTC] ellietsantiara: That wasn't true, Phil didn't even put any money on that project. He wanted too but the other people put more than enough and said it was OK but later they ditched the project and Phil felt left out, also because his friends didn't wanna play games with him anymore, because they had their own channels, shows and jobs
[2017-05-31 06:20:44 UTC] deep_drive: a bbq lol..we're from all over
[2017-05-31 06:21:06 UTC] thirdeyethethird: well that's why i said once a year hahaha
[2017-05-31 06:21:18 UTC] micgelo09: then y would rambo make a vlog explaining what happended?
[2017-05-31 06:21:29 UTC] ellietsantiara: lol @deep_drive maybe in 2 years when Phil is old man we visit him and make bbq
[2017-05-31 06:21:34 UTC] ellietsantiara: *20
[2017-05-31 06:21:35 UTC] deep_drive: theres a reason they took that vlog down the very next day
[2017-05-31 06:22:07 UTC] ellietsantiara: It was made up @micgelo09 they deleted it off his channel
[2017-05-31 06:22:29 UTC] micgelo09: i understand they didnt want to make tension so they took it down cause more people was on phils side while rambo was being shit on
[2017-05-31 06:23:19 UTC] micgelo09: ok how did they make it up then?
[2017-05-31 06:23:27 UTC] deep_drive: lol maybe in 20 years he can have an even where all his fans come...who knows
[2017-05-31 06:23:34 UTC] ellietsantiara: It was a huge misunderstanding, Rambo thought Phil slammed him on one of his videos because of some made up video some haters made, but then Phil on an ask the king session he clarified what really happened, Rambo saw it and that was it, but Phil tried to contact him but Rambo never answered
[2017-05-31 06:24:19 UTC] thirdeyethethird: it will be called "Phil's Detratcorcon" 50 year olds still talking about that time he fapped on stream
[2017-05-31 06:24:30 UTC] micgelo09: it was the other way arund with that phone call situattion
[2017-05-31 06:24:33 UTC] ellietsantiara: All Phil said was that John didn't seem to interested in making videos with him anyomre, and that was it.
[2017-05-31 06:25:10 UTC] leonaras: @EllietSantiAra John explained that in the vlog he posted though.
[2017-05-31 06:25:19 UTC] ellietsantiara: Well believe what you wish Micgelo, I believe Phil and I know he told the truth
[2017-05-31 06:25:51 UTC] gopplett: Go to Progressive, type in someone's address and you'll see every vehicle they have registered at the dmv. Phil has the BMW still and his new car is a 2017 Toyota Corolla.
[2017-05-31 06:25:53 UTC] micgelo09: im not saying their lying im just saying something doesnt sound right with that story
[2017-05-31 06:26:54 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yeah but them loosing contact and not talking things lead to them dividing and not being able to tell the full story. it happens to everyone when they don't communicate. Even Phil admited that he wish one day John would meet him so they can finally tall and get over it
[2017-05-31 06:27:02 UTC] micgelo09: i just look at things from both sides not just phil not just sok not just rambo i listen to both sides to make a conclusion
[2017-05-31 06:28:11 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yes, I get you. I also listened to Rambo s podcast about it and I came to the conclusion I just told you; lack of communication
[2017-05-31 06:28:15 UTC] micgelo09: all not both sry my engrish is wunky
[2017-05-31 06:29:10 UTC] ellietsantiara: lol @thirdeyethethird a bunch of old men still joking about it haha let's al forget about it finally and have some fucking drinks and shit
[2017-05-31 06:30:11 UTC] ellietsantiara: Well, it was a nice chat but I gotta get some rest, good night everyone, fuck you SoK and fuck you Mort wherever you are
[2017-05-31 06:30:23 UTC] micgelo09: sent a friend request
[2017-05-31 06:30:33 UTC] micgelo09: any1 gotta ps4?
[2017-05-31 06:30:46 UTC] ellietsantiara: alright, peace boys

[2017-05-31 18:03:18 UTC] freewayrickross: what reason
[2017-05-31 18:03:24 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: For the delay
[2017-05-31 18:03:33 UTC] taurusoxford: whatever is going on, he needs to get it sorted out
[2017-05-31 18:03:41 UTC] theethicalpixel: he didnt say

[2017-05-31 18:04:33 UTC] freewayrickross: It can be difficult to get up at the crack of noon

[2017-05-31 18:05:02 UTC] errnoent: Hello everyone
[2017-05-31 18:05:11 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: @TaurusOxford Touche
[2017-05-31 18:05:32 UTC] ggsthatwasme: Hey guys, really quick question. What's the deal with Leanna? Why are trolls constantly talking about her all of a sudden yesterday and today?
[2017-05-31 18:06:08 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: The nudniks are always speculating about Philip and Leanna's relationship
[2017-05-31 18:06:15 UTC] errnoent: GGsThatWasMe because for whatever reason they think she has left Phil.
[2017-05-31 18:08:18 UTC] rnrs: apparently no one has seen or heard her in a while
[2017-05-31 18:08:28 UTC] rnrs: her soap shop is down and phil doesn't talk about it
[2017-05-31 18:08:41 UTC] theethicalpixel: how many bits can one earn per day by watching ads?
[2017-05-31 18:08:42 UTC] rnrs: the last dip tries it phil had to film himself because eLeann wasn't there to record him
[2017-05-31 18:08:49 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I heard her last week
[2017-05-31 18:08:53 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Phil was talking
[2017-05-31 18:08:54 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and stopped
[2017-05-31 18:08:57 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and she started talking
[2017-05-31 18:09:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and he asked what was for dinner
[2017-05-31 18:09:09 UTC] phoenixrising2015: she told him something and that was it
[2017-05-31 18:09:17 UTC] freewayrickross: so nothing conclusive then. check
[2017-05-31 18:09:26 UTC] errnoent: Fuckin' idiots, stirring up drama as usual
[2017-05-31 18:09:29 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I think it was last week
[2017-05-31 18:09:33 UTC] spikezero: phil gets trolled because he is trollable. if he didnt quit games/matches and go for an long rant about it, nobody would troll him, because it would not be fun anymore to troll a guy who doesnt care and just mutes a guy and moves on with the gameplay, without any effect
[2017-05-31 18:09:47 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The regulars here though remember it I'm sure
[2017-05-31 18:09:56 UTC] phoenixrising2015: He legit stopped mid game to talk to her
[2017-05-31 18:10:17 UTC] errnoent: I mean FFS, is it totally out of the realm of possibility that she got a little worn out doing the soap thing and after having been in the hospital and decided to close her shop temporarily?
[2017-05-31 18:10:17 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and then asked what was for dinner then said because Dinner was taking a while he was playing injustice 2 for an extended time
[2017-05-31 18:10:28 UTC] errnoent: Is that so fucking unbelievable to the teenagers of sok?
[2017-05-31 18:10:30 UTC] rnrs: @SpikeZero I feel like it has become so much more deeper than that
[2017-05-31 18:10:38 UTC] rnrs: these people downright don't like Phil as a person
[2017-05-31 18:10:54 UTC] rnrs: and I can see both sides of it
[2017-05-31 18:10:56 UTC] spikezero: as long as he guits matches and rants/whines about i, the trolling will continue
[2017-05-31 18:11:01 UTC] rnrs: the whole thing is fun to watch imo
[2017-05-31 18:11:06 UTC] rnrs: half the reason Im here
[2017-05-31 18:11:22 UTC] errnoent: wah wah, nothing to do with my life so I'll spend time trolling someone on twitch
[2017-05-31 18:11:43 UTC] rnrs: @errnoent
[2017-05-31 18:11:51 UTC] rnrs: not to defend them but thats kind of ignorant
[2017-05-31 18:12:01 UTC] rnrs: one of them just graduated college
[2017-05-31 18:12:13 UTC] rnrs: and they raised $10,000 for clean water
[2017-05-31 18:12:18 UTC] deep_drive: well no chat bots last night so thats a first
[2017-05-31 18:12:26 UTC] rnrs: they aren't great people but they aren't good either
[2017-05-31 18:12:41 UTC] rnrs: they kind of remind me of Watchmen awkwardly enough
[2017-05-31 18:13:15 UTC] rnrs: let me stop talk about them tho
[2017-05-31 18:13:23 UTC] rnrs: before I get accused of being with them or something
[2017-05-31 18:13:42 UTC] freewayrickross: they aren't great people but they aren't good either
[2017-05-31 18:14:13 UTC] rnrs: Phil does sometimes make their job a lot easier than he should though
[2017-05-31 18:14:16 UTC] errnoent: RnRs it's not ignorant, just because they've graduated college and started a fundraiser doesn't somehow negate the way they behave in other settings
[2017-05-31 18:14:54 UTC] rnrs: yes but I wouldn't go as far as to say they have nothing better to do
[2017-05-31 18:15:09 UTC] rnrs: this seems to them like a fun hobby as twisted as it sounds
[2017-05-31 18:15:12 UTC] theethicalpixel: these trolls indirectly support phil just by merely watching him, irony
[2017-05-31 18:15:39 UTC] duderito2: graduating and obtaining a political science degree is not something to write home about. It kinda makes sense they have so much free time to do 7 hours analysis vids.
[2017-05-31 18:15:46 UTC] deep_drive: except many of them restream phil for the purpose that he won't make money on it TheEthicalPixel
[2017-05-31 18:15:47 UTC] errnoent: RnRs Clearly they don't, why else would they spend such time digging up drama and shit on Phil, as well as actively trolling him?
[2017-05-31 18:16:06 UTC] rnrs: it's not hard to dig up the stuff they talk about
[2017-05-31 18:16:06 UTC] zahvone: I suspect that a lot of them are actually fans jumping on the bandwagon.
[2017-05-31 18:16:11 UTC] rnrs: again Phil makes what they do very easy
[2017-05-31 18:16:27 UTC] rnrs: its not like they pull stuff out of thin air
[2017-05-31 18:16:33 UTC] theethicalpixel: i meant in general but in respect to that well yeah thats kinda extreme
[2017-05-31 18:16:37 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Any minute now The Joker is going to appear by RnRs saying all this chit chat is going to get him hurt
[2017-05-31 18:16:46 UTC] errnoent: but my point is, why spend your time harassing someone? It indicates an emotional/mental issue on their part
[2017-05-31 18:16:48 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I'm like him though at this point. I don't even care anymore
[2017-05-31 18:16:54 UTC] rnrs: oh know
[2017-05-31 18:16:58 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I'm just watching it unfold
[2017-05-31 18:17:01 UTC] rnrs: someone is gonna hurt me over the internet
[2017-05-31 18:17:22 UTC] rnrs: you can counterpoint and say that at times Phil does the same?
[2017-05-31 18:17:29 UTC] rnrs: again I don't want to get into this
[2017-05-31 18:17:37 UTC] errnoent: Who does Phil harass?
[2017-05-31 18:17:37 UTC] spikezero: phil makes it very easy for trolls. if they get out reaction, quiting games/rants and so on, they will continue with that. actions without a reactions are pointless
[2017-05-31 18:17:39 UTC] rnrs: I don't have a side in this just my observation

[2017-05-31 18:33:25 UTC] leonaras: He does play with his own xbone though.

[2017-05-31 18:36:44 UTC] errnoent: I come to this stream (not every single stream and not for the whole duration) because it is entertaining
[2017-05-31 18:36:49 UTC] rx93gundamm: phil is late becasue he bought a cat

[2017-05-31 18:40:16 UTC] leonaras: Isnt leanna having a cat at home proof enough? Or is she not at home?

[2017-05-31 18:40:41 UTC] yaslothy: cool as a cucumber
[2017-05-31 18:40:44 UTC] thirdeyethethird: we should ask if the car was bought for the cat and is the cat's name aristocat

[2017-05-31 18:42:10 UTC] rx93gundamm: at someones place?
[2017-05-31 18:42:14 UTC] cherry_dood: So what's Mort's claim? That his messages weren't read so he's disputing the claims?
[2017-05-31 18:42:40 UTC] cherry_dood: I know Phil doesn't read troll tips, I mean. Wondering if that's his angle.
[2017-05-31 18:42:45 UTC] betheallen: i like the good ol days when cherdy was always here :(
[2017-05-31 18:42:47 UTC] sanguinenite: Troll cheers are obviously not going to read troll tips

[2017-05-31 18:43:32 UTC] sanguinenite: I dont think so because paypal is aware of the troll tipping here on twitch
[2017-05-31 18:43:35 UTC] yaslothy: When you level up your Personality in Oblivion Kreygasm
[2017-05-31 18:43:44 UTC] litterial: @FreewayRickRoss he doesn't because getting your donation read is not the purpose of tipping
[2017-05-31 18:43:44 UTC] betheallen: lol
[2017-05-31 18:43:45 UTC] errnoent: from the way Phil described it, it sounded like mort was just typing nonsensical shit into the message box. Probably similar to bethe's corn-related rants lol
[2017-05-31 18:43:50 UTC] cherry_dood: @sanguinenite I know that, What I mean is that in the past, someone tried this and Phil could point to the fact that he read the message online so they got what they paid for. If he didn't, this Mort guy/girl might say he didn't get what he paid for.
[2017-05-31 18:44:03 UTC] betheallen: cherdy having good personality in a game :D :D
[2017-05-31 18:44:14 UTC] freewayrickross: yea I doubt mortypants will get that money back then
[2017-05-31 18:44:16 UTC] yaslothy: Yes bethe it's to make up for my personality in real life

[2017-05-31 18:47:23 UTC] philtheboss2367: What was the longest pre stream phil ever did?
[2017-05-31 18:47:23 UTC] yaslothy: but hey I don't run this joint
[2017-05-31 18:47:26 UTC] deep_drive: hes not even scheduled to start the stream till 12 pst slothy

[2017-05-31 18:47:37 UTC] cherry_dood: The schedule is wonky usually. Says 11AM, then it doesn't start until 11:20, then the game is at like 12:20.
[2017-05-31 18:47:43 UTC] bentboxer: i hope phil doesnt shelve star trek psvr... thats like two things i love rolled into one

[2017-05-31 18:48:14 UTC] stooopid_dood: Where's Phillip?
[2017-05-31 18:48:20 UTC] yaslothy: i know deep but he usually starts pre stream at 11:30 and last until after 12...then I think he should start pre stream 10 mins before 12 and start on time is all I'm saying
[2017-05-31 18:48:42 UTC] yaslothy: That paragraph didn't really make sense but just go with it.

[2017-05-31 18:50:07 UTC] litterial: I do believe some pre-streams are a bit too long if nothing pertinent is going on
[2017-05-31 18:50:28 UTC] philtheboss2367: It's Phil stream if he wants he could only stream an hour a day
[2017-05-31 18:50:37 UTC] philtheboss2367: He doesn't have to follow the schedule

[2017-05-31 20:43:58 UTC] betheallen: duka i know its not i got the hang of it during my first try to be honest, that was a long match

[2017-05-31 20:44:44 UTC] bd1899: Is this game even spawning Jason any more?
[2017-05-31 20:44:45 UTC] ellietsantiara: Yeah i think we've seen everything this game has to offer at this point.

[2017-05-31 20:44:48 UTC] daddi_boi: @philtheboss2367 totally his fault actually
[2017-05-31 20:44:49 UTC] semifamouspervert35: It's not terrible, but it's kind of stale at this point.
[2017-05-31 20:44:51 UTC] 1buttondash: Capcom is rushing out Mvc infinite, the roster is ass and the game is gonna be incomplete and a broken mess. fuck Capcom
[2017-05-31 20:44:57 UTC] pureo_nikku: snappin' necks cashin' checks @BeTheAllen

[2017-05-31 20:45:02 UTC] pressdembuttons: @mfd4419 so no cooperation, no hcatting, no bantz. sounds terribly boring/ cowardly
[2017-05-31 20:45:03 UTC] mangod112: @forwardarro her and x are good ideas for dlc, the devs were saying
[2017-05-31 20:45:11 UTC] encelor: @1ButtonDash they better not rush that game
[2017-05-31 20:45:11 UTC] daddi_boi: @philtheboss2367 cause he chose to do it?
[2017-05-31 20:45:14 UTC] sylvati: what is the point of this? every time I check a channel, scrubs just running around. I'm confused.
[2017-05-31 20:45:14 UTC] ughhhj: He is the one that turned it off
[2017-05-31 20:45:14 UTC] forwardarro: @mangod112 X above all else. Best film and best Jason design.
[2017-05-31 20:45:19 UTC] philtheboss2367: @daddi_boi blame the trolls
[2017-05-31 20:45:22 UTC] bobbi_ling: beth you wouldn't be jason, youd be the fat man that was t bagging earlier

[2017-05-31 20:45:40 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: yeah this is kinda boring without talking to people in game
[2017-05-31 20:45:45 UTC] 1buttondash: i think nobody is talking in this pub anyway
[2017-05-31 20:45:47 UTC] mangod112: @forwardarro my favorite jason design was FvsJ but they dont have the rights to it
[2017-05-31 20:45:47 UTC] bodiebthewire: i mean ur gonna make it boring for a 1 in 10 chance
[2017-05-31 20:45:50 UTC] philtheboss2367: @daddi_boi Classic Sok comeback lol
[2017-05-31 20:45:51 UTC] euffy: @sylvati Multiplayer game. One player plays a murderous Jason, rest try to avoid him and eventually escape.
[2017-05-31 20:46:04 UTC] vendatus: saying Jason X is the best WutFace
[2017-05-31 20:46:12 UTC] ellietsantiara: This game is boring anyways, chat and squad, or no chat and no squad
[2017-05-31 20:46:14 UTC] daddi_boi: @philtheboss2367 lul ok
[2017-05-31 20:46:17 UTC] ughhhj: And why can't he just ignore it if they are trolling who gives a shit what they say, him muting it let's trolls win
[2017-05-31 20:46:17 UTC] chowb321: capcom financials aren't too good at the moment, they will focus more on rereleases, remasters and ports to make up cost
[2017-05-31 20:46:23 UTC] bodiebthewire: k but its even more boring
[2017-05-31 20:46:25 UTC] forwardarro: @mangod112 That one seems fairly iconic too, a shame. Jason X is the most obvious missing one though. And yes Jason X is best IDC what the nostalgic critics say.
[2017-05-31 20:46:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: uh oh NotLikeThis famous last words
[2017-05-31 20:46:31 UTC] philtheboss2367: @daddi_boi be mad lol

[2017-05-31 20:47:06 UTC] d1mech: @semifamouspervert35 not Phil's fault people always try to troll him

[2017-05-31 20:47:35 UTC] mangod112: I think friendly fire can kill you
[2017-05-31 20:47:38 UTC] mfd4419: More trolls
[2017-05-31 20:47:40 UTC] pressdembuttons: @d1mech it is his fault for running away and then acting like billy big bollocks when they cant hear him though

[2017-05-31 20:47:46 UTC] vendatus: only*
[2017-05-31 20:47:47 UTC] semifamouspervert35: But still, the "fuck the trolls" and arguing in the chat with them doesn't help things.
[2017-05-31 20:47:51 UTC] ellietsantiara: 1
[2017-05-31 20:47:51 UTC] thirdeyethethird: nah you can swim in the water

[2017-05-31 20:47:57 UTC] duc_: suicide from boredom

[2017-05-31 20:48:07 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: if only she could actually hear you...
[2017-05-31 20:48:12 UTC] mangod112: @forwardarro its got good popularity but critically so far a flop due to the trolling and the bullying of jason
[2017-05-31 20:48:12 UTC] mfd4419: Yes yes fall damage
[2017-05-31 20:48:15 UTC] furiouskirk6: bear traps arent suicide

[2017-05-31 20:48:24 UTC] d1mech: @pressdembuttons well they always bring up his gf, etc... it's not trolling, it's being a complete asshole
[2017-05-31 20:48:26 UTC] ughhhj: @pureo_nikku he's already going to look bad regardless though, just move on and play regardless, of course it's annoying but it's something that's going to happen when people stream
[2017-05-31 20:48:35 UTC] betheallen: kate oh and trump is a dumb fuck so who knows what it meant
[2017-05-31 20:48:48 UTC] forwardarro: @mangod112 It's obviously very buggy and incomplete. I hope it's a success as it's the best F13 game by a mile.
[2017-05-31 20:48:49 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Trump best president
[2017-05-31 20:48:56 UTC] ellietsantiara: Tronald Dump, the clown prince of America
[2017-05-31 20:48:58 UTC] mangod112: @forwardarro these types of games are still being perfected though. Last Year might be a solid entry in this genre
[2017-05-31 20:49:00 UTC] katexo234: Lol bethe
[2017-05-31 20:49:00 UTC] goldencolts: trump is a smart man he has the biggest intellect, you know it, i know it, everyone knows it
[2017-05-31 20:49:03 UTC] pureo_nikku: I can promise u there's no way anyone else playing this game gets that kind of "bad attention" @ughhhj maybe they are noticed but they don't have the stigma

[2017-05-31 20:49:15 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Trump just does things nobody else can do
[2017-05-31 20:49:15 UTC] daddi_boi: the best words
[2017-05-31 20:49:19 UTC] bodiebthewire: shut up about politics
[2017-05-31 20:49:20 UTC] forwardarro: @mangod112 I care most about this one as Jason/F13 is the best IP for this, it's a perfect fit
[2017-05-31 20:49:24 UTC] drilbit777: Donald trump still makes a better presidents than hilary lol

[2017-05-31 20:49:30 UTC] masterswielder: @dragoon11436 Blunt weapons, like the bat and the wrench are good at stunning, blades like the machete and the axe do more damage to take his mask off
[2017-05-31 20:49:33 UTC] drilbit777: Shes worse by far
[2017-05-31 20:49:38 UTC] daddi_boi: @philtheboss2367 cmonBruh
[2017-05-31 20:49:38 UTC] 1buttondash: what happened to all those anti-trump rallies? i guess the people got bored and saw it wasn't doing anything lol
[2017-05-31 20:49:39 UTC] bodiebthewire: people trying to sound smart
[2017-05-31 20:49:43 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Hilary scares me the look in her eyes actually scares me

[2017-05-31 20:49:53 UTC] mfd4419: Yawning
[2017-05-31 20:49:55 UTC] goldencolts: how do you get smooth glowing skin like this player character model
[2017-05-31 20:50:03 UTC] chrisbreezy00: 1buttondash their jobs probably told them if they kept calling days off they would fire their dumb asses
[2017-05-31 20:50:06 UTC] masterswielder: @dragoon11436 Jason can swim. Nad you make a LOT of noise swimming

[2017-05-31 20:50:33 UTC] seashanty: Phil when you find things for vehicles to leave its always good to keep them in places YOU remember because the others will leave without you
[2017-05-31 20:50:35 UTC] semifamouspervert35: There's not much else going on.
[2017-05-31 20:50:38 UTC] guccikodak: its funny seeing hicks losing all their funding cause they believed trump.
[2017-05-31 20:50:38 UTC] forwardarro: @mangod112 Did they say anything themselves yet about what they plan to do? The reception has been so pathetic that I could see it ruin plans
[2017-05-31 20:50:41 UTC] dragoon11436: @Masterswielder I never see him swim in a movie.
[2017-05-31 20:50:48 UTC] bd1899: Is Jason glitched today?
[2017-05-31 20:50:48 UTC] mrpapaveraceae: There should be an unlockable with Jason as Trump and has a bunch of his quotes.
[2017-05-31 20:50:50 UTC] ellietsantiara: @SemiFamousPervert35 Touché...
