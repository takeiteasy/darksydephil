[2017-05-28 18:28:57 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @DarksydePhil how far are you in Rick & Morty?
[2017-05-28 18:28:57 UTC] glitch_crazed: @blearyline7 you'd think with a Multiplayer only game currently that it'd only be 20$
[2017-05-28 18:29:23 UTC] blearyline7: Yeah that's roughly the price dead By Daylight is
[2017-05-28 18:29:28 UTC] epicnightshades: I personally think this is an amazing hide and seek game, and like hide and seek, it's so much fun with friends just fucking around
[2017-05-28 18:29:33 UTC] unoriginaldavid: When did it start working? Because I remember you switching to injustice then I fell asleep
[2017-05-28 18:29:34 UTC] baiduspider: jason is nothing just imagine if sonic was in this game with his chainsaw you have no chance

[2017-05-28 18:29:50 UTC] 0megaj0ker: the entire game is Hide & Seek
[2017-05-28 18:29:59 UTC] drzombius: I heard some are still are having issues on connecting on PC with this game
[2017-05-28 18:30:00 UTC] xgameofpwns: the game is funny as hell to watch
[2017-05-28 18:30:04 UTC] glitch_crazed: @0megaj0ker it's basically your basic Slasher game
[2017-05-28 18:30:04 UTC] theadamlee23: It definitely is entertaining but I agree with Phil.
[2017-05-28 18:30:12 UTC] deep_drive: he played it on friday night unoriginaldavid

[2017-05-28 18:30:36 UTC] epicnightshades: It's a 40 dollar game, right? I hope they'll add more DLC maps and items, and maybe even new gamemodes other than hide and seek
[2017-05-28 18:30:38 UTC] betheallen: in my eyes phil never played this game on stream because I WASNT HERE

[2017-05-28 18:42:08 UTC] blearyline7: F13 seems like a terrible game but it's really fun to watch, especially if some co-op happens like in phil's first set
[2017-05-28 18:42:12 UTC] rinmathews: @0megaj0ker Phil nees to learn how to play the game before he gets Jason again. I was amazed he even killed 3 people with how little he knew
[2017-05-28 18:42:12 UTC] guccikodak: Tekken is so robotic looking it looks like rockem sockem robots

Shadow Warrior 2 is 40, and the bundle for both games right now is 34, so you are saving 6 dollars on Shadow Warrior 2 so you can back log it or play it on off days. I honestly am shocked they are essentially selling their own game for 6 dollars less and giving you the first game for essentially free

[2017-05-28 20:12:46 UTC] bedrohen88: I wasn't blaming Phil earlier. I was just suggesting it may have been his connection. Just trying to help.

[2017-05-28 20:13:39 UTC] unoriginaldavid: I don't think it's his connection otherwise he should have had issues with other games too... not sure though it might be, in my opinion it's just their servers failing
[2017-05-28 20:13:45 UTC] heroicbiz: When's Overwatch?
[2017-05-28 20:13:46 UTC] midnight_strike_force: It would have been.
[2017-05-28 20:13:47 UTC] xgameofpwns: Can we all agree that Phil needs to tone down his reactions to people aking/giving advice? Could be alienating new viewers being so abrasive
[2017-05-28 20:13:47 UTC] lovephilass: Lol i gotta go re-watch that video of overwatch
[2017-05-28 20:13:47 UTC] dspfandood: this use your words games looks like it has lots of potential
[2017-05-28 20:13:54 UTC] midnight_strike_force: Overwatch wouldn't have costed money, and it has new stuff.
[2017-05-28 20:13:55 UTC] furiouskirk6: We just gotta leave it alone if Phil doesnt want to try it. Phil might just be in the unlucky percentage of 1F3th not working
[2017-05-28 20:14:02 UTC] einsatzgruppn: apparently you can only play overwatch when there is a new character which is like once a fucking year lol

[2017-05-28 20:14:48 UTC] amineo2: He should play Nier Automata again
[2017-05-28 20:14:51 UTC] baiduspider: @xbox1_is_garbage your username is bullshit because gears of war is the best game ever made
[2017-05-28 20:15:01 UTC] charizard545: phil is taking a well deserved break, exhausting to browse psn for 2 hours
[2017-05-28 20:15:08 UTC] midnight_strike_force: @HeroicBiz He's gonna play Jackbox from the flea market.

[2017-05-28 20:15:29 UTC] amineo2: He left Nier Automata at ending A, which is 20% of the game no joke
[2017-05-28 20:15:33 UTC] einsatzgruppn: I'm sorry, I thought Phil played whatever his fans wanted. Isn't that his whole theme? @jmon_1985
[2017-05-28 20:15:42 UTC] blearyline7: Overcooked seems like a fun game, though it needs more than 1 person to make a fun stream
[2017-05-28 20:15:43 UTC] allisterkendross: His leg is being itchy, again.
[2017-05-28 20:16:00 UTC] charizard545: @einsatzgruppn phil is self employed he plays what he wants, hes already set for life
[2017-05-28 20:16:01 UTC] stuart360: A bit of a wasted evening so fay. I wish Phil would just make a decision sometimes lol
[2017-05-28 20:16:03 UTC] leonaras: @allisterkendross i itched my leg earlier
[2017-05-28 20:16:07 UTC] lovephilass: @einsatzgruppn To a degree yes lol but if phil gets upset at the game and rage quits he isn't coming back to the game
[2017-05-28 20:16:11 UTC] x_tic: @Amineo2 it sucks that he'll never finish it :( one of the best games I've ever played
[2017-05-28 20:16:17 UTC] dspfandood: phil really wanted his 40 bucks worth
[2017-05-28 20:16:19 UTC] dspfandood: oh well
[2017-05-28 20:16:31 UTC] einsatzgruppn: Phil never rage quitted overwatch, he likes the game tho
[2017-05-28 20:16:42 UTC] dspfandood: phil needs new kahntent
[2017-05-28 20:16:44 UTC] midnight_strike_force: People are probably gonna start bugging him about his decision just now in Use Your Words, somehow.
[2017-05-28 20:16:46 UTC] charizard545: phil never rage quit a fighting game, all those videos online are photoshoped
[2017-05-28 20:16:49 UTC] jmon_1985: @einsatzgruppn ppl want scarface, sf5, nioh dlc, bb dlc is he playing those?
[2017-05-28 20:16:51 UTC] lovephilass: @einsatzgruppn He likes the game he just doesn't like getting destroyed on the game
[2017-05-28 20:16:53 UTC] amineo2: @x_tic It would give him a lot of views too
[2017-05-28 20:16:56 UTC] pacman5twitch: @amineo2 I enjoyed NierAutomata that game is one of my favorite PC games
