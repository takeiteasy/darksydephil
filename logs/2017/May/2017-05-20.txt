[2017-05-20 23:08:22 UTC] eplegutten: Hello from Norway Phil
[2017-05-20 23:08:30 UTC] sanguinenite: test
[2017-05-20 23:08:38 UTC] iamkurla249: test test
[2017-05-20 23:08:47 UTC] podusmonens: @MasterWarlord hey man it's how the devs want you to play the game, it's perfectly ok to spam
[2017-05-20 23:08:51 UTC] kekon3: Yes Phil?
[2017-05-20 23:09:31 UTC] veissvorra: nothing wrong with spam. just need to get better at the game to avoid it
[2017-05-20 23:09:46 UTC] veissvorra: i will say they need to change how the meter burn roll works though
[2017-05-20 23:09:52 UTC] veissvorra: shouldn't need to move forward to do it
[2017-05-20 23:10:44 UTC] iamkurla249: yeah best way to avoid it is to dash meter burn roll if u do it properly u can get right in front of him or behind and start combo
[2017-05-20 23:11:24 UTC] robertroverz: what was not a test!!!
[2017-05-20 23:11:29 UTC] robertroverz: that* even
[2017-05-20 23:12:10 UTC] robertroverz: idk i think Phil should play this game at least as much as he has played Overwatch
[2017-05-20 23:12:19 UTC] robertroverz: especially if he gits gud
[2017-05-20 23:12:42 UTC] veissvorra: dunno about that
[2017-05-20 23:12:51 UTC] suckasurprise: Yeah watching him play fighting games is pretty entertaining
[2017-05-20 23:13:05 UTC] veissvorra: after awhile the skill gap might be too much
[2017-05-20 23:13:33 UTC] robertroverz: people will prefer to watch this than overwatch though as it's 1vs1 and you can all that is going on
[2017-05-20 23:13:44 UTC] veissvorra: true
[2017-05-20 23:13:46 UTC] robertroverz: sure i'm not saying he should go crazy with it
[2017-05-20 23:13:57 UTC] iamkurla249: well if he plays with just viewers the skill gap shouldn't be a problem
[2017-05-20 23:14:12 UTC] robertroverz: but play to a base level of decent competition
[2017-05-20 23:14:55 UTC] robertroverz: there are a few games during the year he could probably give a miss to
[2017-05-20 23:15:45 UTC] runes85: did Phil ever mention if he's going to play a platformer called skylar & plux: adventures on clover island?.
[2017-05-20 23:15:53 UTC] masterwarlord: Well if he gets too good with the top tiers like Darkseid and Cold against noobs he can still force himself to play the low tiers. I don't know how much tolerance he has for the weaker characters though
[2017-05-20 23:15:53 UTC] robertroverz: idk
[2017-05-20 23:17:04 UTC] runes85: I wonder if nightmare is in injustice 2
[2017-05-20 23:17:25 UTC] robertroverz: i like it when he was having a chat with Brian between matches and as well during the fights vs randoms when he was discussing characters and tactics
[2017-05-20 23:17:49 UTC] robertroverz: not so much when he was talking about lag constantly though, after a while it's a bit much :P
[2017-05-20 23:18:25 UTC] tantamounter: cheer70
[2017-05-20 23:18:26 UTC] runes85: ok
[2017-05-20 23:18:42 UTC] runes85: what game is this?.
[2017-05-20 23:20:51 UTC] robertroverz: hmm not sure, seems like a fun indie game
[2017-05-20 23:26:52 UTC] veissvorra: it's that dark souls metroidvania like game
