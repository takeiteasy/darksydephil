[2017-05-03 00:00:02 UTC] ufccurbstomp: SoK doesn't make money off their videos about Phil
[2017-05-03 00:00:13 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Because they make funny videos
[2017-05-03 00:00:33 UTC] sanguinenite: I dont believe that they would only put ads on videos when they dont make Phil the roasting boy
[2017-05-03 00:01:18 UTC] ufccurbstomp: The SoK doesn't need people's money - they are grateful just us being there and supporting their efforts through gratitude
[2017-05-03 00:02:00 UTC] don_vare: yo where da *** piggy at?
[2017-05-03 00:02:04 UTC] ufccurbstomp: This isn't a business to them - it's a way to get together with people and laugh
[2017-05-03 00:02:27 UTC] fabsgnecco: fat is a banned word ?
[2017-05-03 00:02:32 UTC] fabsgnecco: oh lol
[2017-05-03 00:02:41 UTC] leokira997: and they have jobs themselves so
[2017-05-03 00:02:45 UTC] sanguinenite: I am laughing at how they roast Phil and how they need to roast someone unrelated to them to get viewership and interest
[2017-05-03 00:02:49 UTC] skyfx89: @don_vare Either to the slaughterhouse or to his office to plan how he gonna do his next e-beg
[2017-05-03 00:03:02 UTC] philtheboss2367: What ever happened to KOCC?
[2017-05-03 00:03:16 UTC] sanguinenite: Sure they may not monetize the videos of them roasting Phil but it still advertises their channel and grab attention
[2017-05-03 00:03:18 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @skyfx89 He already did one yesterday - he has to wait at least a week for a new one :P
[2017-05-03 00:03:22 UTC] leokira997: kocc was canned because of the name most likely, think its called something else now isnt it?
[2017-05-03 00:03:23 UTC] sanguinenite: making them talentless hacks
[2017-05-03 00:03:45 UTC] skyfx89: @ufccurbstomp I saw it "bwaa bwaaa muh adds!"
[2017-05-03 00:03:46 UTC] leokira997: for what purpose though?
[2017-05-03 00:03:53 UTC] ufccurbstomp: ...your logic is retarded
[2017-05-03 00:03:55 UTC] sanguinenite: To get attention
[2017-05-03 00:04:09 UTC] sanguinenite: My logic is too good that even haters cant and refuse to get it
[2017-05-03 00:04:14 UTC] philtheboss2367: In a way Phil tried to steal TIHYDP
[2017-05-03 00:04:25 UTC] sanguinenite: Technically, he is entitled to
[2017-05-03 00:04:28 UTC] don_vare: do you still get banned if you say you use add block
[2017-05-03 00:04:30 UTC] leokira997: what is the point of the attention?
[2017-05-03 00:04:31 UTC] ufccurbstomp: After spending years shitting on it saying it ruined him
[2017-05-03 00:04:50 UTC] philtheboss2367: After he saw the success it was getting
[2017-05-03 00:05:01 UTC] charlie_decker: you wanna know the irony of it all
[2017-05-03 00:05:05 UTC] vpzneox: I'd actually have tons to add for both sides
[2017-05-03 00:05:06 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @philtheboss2367 YEARS late though
[2017-05-03 00:05:07 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I use adblock but not on all videos lol, I use it all the time when I watch SoK tho
[2017-05-03 00:05:19 UTC] charlie_decker: phil's a bad gamer. he just is. he's bad at the vidya. but if he had owned that fact, instead of literally jacking off over how good he is
[2017-05-03 00:05:20 UTC] leokira997: adblock does nothing on sok
[2017-05-03 00:05:20 UTC] ufccurbstomp: He should have been getting that back in the MGS days
[2017-05-03 00:05:22 UTC] leokira997: theres no ads
[2017-05-03 00:05:27 UTC] charlie_decker: i could easily see him having 500k subscribers or more today
[2017-05-03 00:05:35 UTC] don_vare: i use add block everywhere
[2017-05-03 00:05:47 UTC] don_vare: except in site of artists i like
[2017-05-03 00:05:48 UTC] skyfx89: Phil even sold his dignity when he tried to market his TIHYDP videos. "I'll let you shit on my dignity for a few bucks"
[2017-05-03 00:05:57 UTC] vpzneox: but since I can either type or read at the same time from my mobile I'd rather do the latter
[2017-05-03 00:06:30 UTC] skyfx89: Phil is the biggest hypocrite ever calling others for bullies when there's tons of videos of him saying the nastiest thing to players and even his fans, HIS FANS!
[2017-05-03 00:06:49 UTC] skyfx89: So much does he cares about his fans
[2017-05-03 00:06:59 UTC] philtheboss2367: Phil shits on people getting free games
[2017-05-03 00:07:16 UTC] sanguinenite: lol you guys are boring me with a lack of logical comebacks. lol no creator on twitch or youtube gives much of a shit on their fans. Look at celebrities, they treat their fans like shit XD
[2017-05-03 00:07:32 UTC] valomek: Why would anyone not use adblock all day everyday.
[2017-05-03 00:07:39 UTC] skyfx89: He wouldnt give two shits about you as soon you stopped donating. You Phil fans are so gullible to think he even give two shits about other than your wallet
[2017-05-03 00:07:47 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @sanguinenite You're full of shit if you think that
[2017-05-03 00:08:14 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Go watch Maximilian_dood. He wouldn't be getting thousand+ dollar donations if he treated his fans like Phil does
[2017-05-03 00:08:17 UTC] sanguinenite: I will come back later! LOL you guys buy their acting of caring for their fans, you guys are funny as fuck
[2017-05-03 00:08:28 UTC] sanguinenite: or gullible as fuck
[2017-05-03 00:08:37 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Later troll
[2017-05-03 00:08:41 UTC] skyfx89: says you...
[2017-05-03 00:08:43 UTC] philtheboss2367: So who's fault is it when Phil goes under? Who will he blame first haters or fans?
[2017-05-03 00:08:43 UTC] skyfx89: haha
[2017-05-03 00:09:07 UTC] fabsgnecco: both lol
[2017-05-03 00:09:16 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @philtheboss2367 Youtube, machinima, SoK, Slowbeef, TIHYDP... Pick one
[2017-05-03 00:09:17 UTC] skyfx89: @sanguinenite You should really stop projecting your faults calling others gullible
[2017-05-03 00:09:18 UTC] fabsgnecco: first the trolls, of course
[2017-05-03 00:09:58 UTC] philtheboss2367: @ufccurbstomp I don't believe he'll make it through the summer
[2017-05-03 00:11:00 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @philtheboss2367 I would normally say the same but he seems to constantly eek his way through life so much that I can't tell any more
[2017-05-03 00:11:16 UTC] don_vare: i kinda wanna follow the channel just to be here when the "bussines" goes belly up but i don't wanna give this crap a follow
[2017-05-03 00:11:51 UTC] philtheboss2367: I can't wait for the final video he'll do (final fuck this, fuck you all)
[2017-05-03 00:11:53 UTC] skyfx89: @don_vare Use ad-block when you watch his streams
[2017-05-03 00:12:06 UTC] skyfx89: that way you dont support him
[2017-05-03 00:12:56 UTC] don_vare: i do use it
[2017-05-03 00:14:11 UTC] philtheboss2367: Lmao he really disabled the comments on the two videos last night lol
[2017-05-03 00:14:43 UTC] leokira997: of course he did
[2017-05-03 00:15:01 UTC] philtheboss2367: Criticism to him is trolling
[2017-05-03 00:15:05 UTC] leokira997: was nothing but people telling him to get a job
[2017-05-03 00:15:20 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @LeoKira997 But muh bad back
[2017-05-03 00:16:09 UTC] philtheboss2367: "Toxic" comments
[2017-05-03 00:16:17 UTC] don_vare: he can't get a job at this point unless is at micky d's flipping burgers
[2017-05-03 00:16:49 UTC] ufccurbstomp: "What do you mean I have to flip the burgers?!"
[2017-05-03 00:16:58 UTC] ufccurbstomp: "WOW DUDE!"
[2017-05-03 00:16:59 UTC] don_vare: or bagging groceries at wal-mart
[2017-05-03 00:17:16 UTC] don_vare: "you want paper or plastic"
[2017-05-03 00:19:54 UTC] twistedmetalkane: ack ack ack
[2017-05-03 00:21:30 UTC] leokira997: seattle air ufccurbstomp
[2017-05-03 00:22:56 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @LeoKira997 cures herniated disks apparently
[2017-05-03 00:24:31 UTC] sanguinenite: Criticism is trolling. Censorship of haters is needed. I mean youtube and facebook do it all the time but OH GOD FORBID when Phil does it :P
[2017-05-03 00:24:45 UTC] sanguinenite: I agree with Phil's policing of the comment section
[2017-05-03 00:25:16 UTC] leokira997: he does need a job though
[2017-05-03 00:25:50 UTC] leokira997: if hes worried about not getting his bills paid why would he not get a job, not even a fulltime job just something part time
[2017-05-03 00:26:03 UTC] philtheboss2367: Constructive criticism is trolling?
[2017-05-03 00:26:18 UTC] sanguinenite: You guys call it "constructive" when it is clearly NOT XD
[2017-05-03 00:26:59 UTC] sanguinenite: I do agree that he needs an alternative stream of revenue, then you talentless hacks can go shit on yourselves that he no longer needs you trolls XD
[2017-05-03 00:27:17 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @sanguinenite he was given constructive criticism for years, and only ever shit on it. Most people have given up on trying to be constructive.
[2017-05-03 00:27:33 UTC] auzziesly47adam: DSP is my Hero
[2017-05-03 00:27:39 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Now he's at the point where even if he followed that helpful advice, it's too late
[2017-05-03 00:27:57 UTC] philtheboss2367: Positive criticism is trolling
[2017-05-03 00:28:04 UTC] sanguinenite: I have given constructive criticism too but he did not apply them, I am not about to hate on Phil just because he refused to listen to my advice
[2017-05-03 00:28:27 UTC] sanguinenite: But haters feel so entitled about their own opinions that they think DSP should listen to them no matter what
[2017-05-03 00:29:04 UTC] philtheboss2367: He always asking for help on what he should do and ignores it
[2017-05-03 00:29:09 UTC] leokira997: ^
[2017-05-03 00:29:10 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @sanguinenite you are aware that those "haters" that you love to mock were once loyal fans right?
[2017-05-03 00:29:33 UTC] ufccurbstomp: They didn't appear out of thin air - these are people that tried to help Phil and only get spit on for their efforts
[2017-05-03 00:29:34 UTC] sanguinenite: Well maybe they should have been smarter and be like me, I am a fan of no one but myself
[2017-05-03 00:29:41 UTC] leokira997: "what should i do?" get a job (even part time) and do twitch/youtube on the side
[2017-05-03 00:29:49 UTC] sanguinenite: I do not need to burn bridges that way
[2017-05-03 00:30:48 UTC] philtheboss2367: He's asking the Patreons on help for the next goal right? I'll guarantee he'll ignore what they say and make the "executive decision"
[2017-05-03 00:30:49 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @sanguinenite You're here. You're clearly a fan of Phil, either ironically or unironically
[2017-05-03 00:31:12 UTC] ufccurbstomp: You wouldn't be here otherwise
[2017-05-03 00:31:30 UTC] sanguinenite: lol so are the haters of phil, they wouldnt be stalking him the way they do otherwise
[2017-05-03 00:31:42 UTC] ufccurbstomp: No one is stalking him
[2017-05-03 00:31:42 UTC] sanguinenite: everyone is a fan, as long as you are a viewer you a fanboy doooddde
[2017-05-03 00:32:20 UTC] sanguinenite: The way that haters stalk phil amazes me, they are bigger fanboys than I am LOLOLOL
[2017-05-03 00:32:47 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Okay, i'm done talking to you. Enjoy whatever fantasy world your tiny mind is living in.
[2017-05-03 00:32:52 UTC] sanguinenite: They know his personal address, his phone number etc. lol they know more about Phil's life than I do, and the best part is they call me a fan boy XD
[2017-05-03 00:32:59 UTC] sanguinenite: lol sure run away when you see logic talking
[2017-05-03 00:33:08 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Ignored. I can't stand him any more
[2017-05-03 00:33:09 UTC] sanguinenite: thats all you haters can do anyway
[2017-05-03 00:33:11 UTC] sanguinenite: LOL
[2017-05-03 00:34:15 UTC] sanguinenite: Oh I cant get over the irony of the haters of phil, they make me smile XD
[2017-05-03 00:34:49 UTC] leokira997: im just here to see him get upset at the game for his own fuck ups
[2017-05-03 00:34:53 UTC] philtheboss2367: I always wishing for the best of Phil regardless of all the shit he's done
[2017-05-03 00:35:01 UTC] philtheboss2367: I'm*
[2017-05-03 00:35:25 UTC] sanguinenite: Riiiiggghhhttt....... suuuurrrreeee, you stalker haters sure know when to change your tune to pretend that you are not fanboys of phil
[2017-05-03 00:35:53 UTC] sanguinenite: I mean, it is not like your comments weren't deleted earlier for being anti-DSP
[2017-05-03 00:36:13 UTC] leokira997: nothing ive said has been deleted so
[2017-05-03 00:36:31 UTC] sanguinenite: You seem like you are siding with them more than DSP so....
[2017-05-03 00:36:53 UTC] philtheboss2367: Yeah because I'm psychopath who wants to watch Phil burn you caught me
[2017-05-03 00:37:01 UTC] leokira997: yeah because i think phil is an idiot when it comes to his finances and how he plays games
[2017-05-03 00:37:28 UTC] sanguinenite: lol an honest troll? I guess this is what happens when they have nowhere to hide their true selves
[2017-05-03 00:37:30 UTC] sanguinenite: !thebot
[2017-05-03 00:37:31 UTC] nightbot: BOTSONA! MrDestructoid
[2017-05-03 00:38:07 UTC] leokira997: i watched him play jak and daxter, a game i beat when i was 7, and i couldnt believe how bad he was at it
[2017-05-03 00:38:22 UTC] freebeer67: uuuuuuuhhhhhh what did i miss
[2017-05-03 00:38:34 UTC] philtheboss2367: Sarcasm...sir?
[2017-05-03 00:39:36 UTC] freebeer67: did phillium rage?
[2017-05-03 00:40:09 UTC] philtheboss2367: Nioh DLC? Yes^
[2017-05-03 00:42:22 UTC] leokira997: died 70 times on the same boss
[2017-05-03 00:45:44 UTC] philtheboss2367: "Best overall gamer in the country"
[2017-05-03 00:46:23 UTC] freebeer67: I hope someone pool a Loophole592 when Phil brings back hate live
[2017-05-03 00:53:12 UTC] sanguinenite: I love how they are disengaged with me because they realized they have someone that they cant troll LOL
[2017-05-03 00:54:50 UTC] leokira997: i said something and you didnt respond
[2017-05-03 00:55:08 UTC] leokira997: whos the one disengaging now?
[2017-05-03 00:56:11 UTC] sanguinenite: I dont know how whatever you watched from phil is somehow relevant to me LOL you must I give a shit what you think
[2017-05-03 00:59:09 UTC] leokira997: because i said i think hes an idiot when it comes to his finances and how he plays game, i brought up jak and daxter as an example because jak and daxter is the first game i ever completed and holds a special place in my heart
[2017-05-03 00:59:31 UTC] leokira997: his financesi really should not have to point out, weve talked about it already
[2017-05-03 01:00:06 UTC] sanguinenite: lol jak fuchs? lol I really dont care about whatever that is - from what you are saying it is probably a game, a game which I really dont care to know if it even exists but sure, bring it up if you want to.
[2017-05-03 01:01:24 UTC] leokira997: there is no way you do not know what jak and daxter is
[2017-05-03 01:02:28 UTC] sanguinenite: O really?
[2017-05-03 01:02:53 UTC] sanguinenite: You see, this is what I mean, the haters are bigger fanboys than I am LOL
[2017-05-03 01:03:11 UTC] leokira997: what?
[2017-05-03 01:03:41 UTC] sanguinenite: You know about how Phil plays this and that - really who cares? I dont care about whatever game you brought up lol
[2017-05-03 01:04:09 UTC] leokira997: what is a game you care about
[2017-05-03 01:05:06 UTC] sanguinenite: Why's that importnat?
[2017-05-03 01:06:08 UTC] leokira997: cause you said you dont care about jak and daxter, tell me a game you care about
[2017-05-03 01:06:25 UTC] sanguinenite: Phil's most famous LP
[2017-05-03 01:06:31 UTC] sanguinenite: I like that game
[2017-05-03 01:06:58 UTC] leokira997: metal gear?
[2017-05-03 01:07:19 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I never watched that game, but I heard how haters totally hated him for playing that game lol
[2017-05-03 01:08:09 UTC] leokira997: because he constantly insulted kojima and ruined every cutscene
[2017-05-03 01:09:19 UTC] sanguinenite: lol do haters not get what a joke is?
[2017-05-03 01:10:28 UTC] leokira997: a joke is fine, but constant talking during cutscenes when he hasnt played the series before and then being confused about the story is stupid
[2017-05-03 01:12:02 UTC] sanguinenite: Why dont you haters watch the games which you cannot "fuck up" as much as MG series? I dont watch them because I know he sucks at them, so all you have to do is not watch, is that a concept so hard for haters to understand?
[2017-05-03 01:14:59 UTC] leokira997: its not hard to understand but you seem to not understand the entertainment value of people fucking up, you ever wonder why those fail compilations are so popular?
[2017-05-03 01:15:25 UTC] leokira997: not just the fail compilations of phil, but of other streamers/youtubers
[2017-05-03 01:15:26 UTC] sanguinenite: then you all should be praising phil for sucking
[2017-05-03 01:15:52 UTC] leokira997: i dont see the logic there
[2017-05-03 01:15:55 UTC] sanguinenite: It is entertaining, so good for him and so haters should stop getting on his case
[2017-05-03 01:16:16 UTC] sanguinenite: Phil sucking at games doesnt mean now haters have the right to shit on him
[2017-05-03 01:16:28 UTC] sanguinenite: Dont haters get that? lol
[2017-05-03 01:16:33 UTC] leokira997: why praise someone for being shit at a game that isnt difficult? thats why i brought up jak and daxter, its a game meant for children, until you get to the sequels at least
[2017-05-03 01:16:58 UTC] sanguinenite: Why hate on someone for playing like shit?
[2017-05-03 01:17:11 UTC] leokira997: because he does nothing to improve
[2017-05-03 01:17:12 UTC] sanguinenite: The same kind of question can be directed at the haters, just saying
[2017-05-03 01:17:24 UTC] sanguinenite: Why must he improve when you just said he is entertaining?
[2017-05-03 01:17:32 UTC] sanguinenite: entertaining while failing?
[2017-05-03 01:17:37 UTC] sanguinenite: THATS THE WHOLE POINT
[2017-05-03 01:17:57 UTC] leokira997: because a person should not be this bad at games
[2017-05-03 01:18:07 UTC] leokira997: when it is their job at least
[2017-05-03 01:18:25 UTC] sanguinenite: You JUST said he is entertaining when he fails. So what's the issue? LOL
[2017-05-03 01:18:36 UTC] sanguinenite: just because you think no one should suck so much at a game? GTFO
[2017-05-03 01:18:45 UTC] sanguinenite: you must think the world lives by your standards
[2017-05-03 01:19:26 UTC] sanguinenite: boom bitch @LeoKira997
[2017-05-03 01:20:09 UTC] leokira997: its entertaining to see him fail yes, its entertaining to see anyone fail, but no one fucks up as much as phil does
[2017-05-03 01:20:54 UTC] leokira997: its pathetic
[2017-05-03 01:21:01 UTC] sanguinenite: Oh? And that is a problem -Why? His job is an ENTERTAINER on the Internet. lol if him sucking is entertaining, I think he should not worry about improving at all LOL
[2017-05-03 01:21:14 UTC] sanguinenite: You haters dont seem to get the point here.
[2017-05-03 01:21:20 UTC] leokira997: he complains about it though
[2017-05-03 01:21:28 UTC] leokira997: and does nothing to try and improve things
[2017-05-03 01:21:31 UTC] sanguinenite: so what? it is part of the entertainment
[2017-05-03 01:21:45 UTC] sanguinenite: If you dont like it, GTFO no one is forcing you to watch lol
[2017-05-03 01:21:57 UTC] leokira997: i can do as i please
[2017-05-03 01:22:05 UTC] leokira997: i am my own person
[2017-05-03 01:22:20 UTC] sanguinenite: lol you guys watch it because you want to, and whine later
[2017-05-03 01:22:30 UTC] sanguinenite: you guys like self-torture is it?
[2017-05-03 01:22:36 UTC] sanguinenite: Or are you all just that mentally retarded?
[2017-05-03 01:22:46 UTC] sanguinenite: It is clear to me that you haters are just jealous cunts
[2017-05-03 01:23:02 UTC] leokira997: no need to insult me
[2017-05-03 01:23:12 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I am my own person, I will do as I wish
[2017-05-03 01:23:34 UTC] sanguinenite: like the same reasoning given right back at you? lol
[2017-05-03 01:23:38 UTC] leokira997: yes, you can, however i havent insulted you yet
[2017-05-03 01:23:52 UTC] leokira997: there was no need for it, that is all i am saying
[2017-05-03 01:23:59 UTC] sanguinenite: I will insult anyone I want to, whether they have insulted me yet or not is not important :)
[2017-05-03 01:23:59 UTC] leokira997: you can do as you want
[2017-05-03 01:24:12 UTC] sanguinenite: Glad that you agree that I can insult anyone as I wish
[2017-05-03 01:24:35 UTC] sanguinenite: People can call me a fanboy all they want, I will call them jealous cunts all I want
[2017-05-03 01:24:41 UTC] sanguinenite: Two can play at this game
[2017-05-03 01:24:46 UTC] leokira997: havent called you a fanboy
[2017-05-03 01:25:01 UTC] sanguinenite: Uh other haters like you have done up in the chat, scroll back to view
[2017-05-03 01:25:10 UTC] leokira997: im well aware
[2017-05-03 01:25:22 UTC] leokira997: im simply stating ive done no such thing
[2017-05-03 01:25:37 UTC] sanguinenite: I will call you and anyone else here as I damn well please. I think you are stupid to watch someone who you insult
[2017-05-03 01:25:59 UTC] sanguinenite: I mean - If I felt DSP was such a bad person, I wouldnt be sticking around as much as you
[2017-05-03 01:27:26 UTC] leokira997: you act as if im paying attention to this all day
[2017-05-03 01:28:18 UTC] sanguinenite: the fact that you pay any attention at all and still check up on phil shows you have some mental retardation going on. If you think Phil sucks so much, why check at all? LOL
[2017-05-03 01:28:48 UTC] leokira997: ive already told you
[2017-05-03 01:29:01 UTC] sanguinenite: This chat is so brilliant, it shows how haters of Phil have mental disorders
[2017-05-03 01:29:13 UTC] leokira997: everyone has mental disorders
[2017-05-03 01:29:22 UTC] kinggoken: is dsp going to stream again tonight?
[2017-05-03 01:29:23 UTC] sanguinenite: lol says the mentally retarded ones
[2017-05-03 01:29:26 UTC] sanguinenite: Yes
[2017-05-03 01:29:34 UTC] kinggoken: awesome
[2017-05-03 01:31:21 UTC] zachty200: can't wait till he starts playing dangronpa
[2017-05-03 01:31:27 UTC] sanguinenite: All haters failed to give any logical reasons to hate phil as much as they do.
[2017-05-03 01:31:49 UTC] sanguinenite: @zachty200 Yeah I cant wait either but in the meantime I can troll the haters
[2017-05-03 01:32:23 UTC] zachty200: lol troll the dumbass haters
[2017-05-03 01:32:34 UTC] kinggoken: haters?
[2017-05-03 01:32:41 UTC] sanguinenite: yeah lol their lack of logical reasoning is funny af
[2017-05-03 01:33:00 UTC] kinggoken: I thought we couldn't talk about the haters in the chat
[2017-05-03 01:33:00 UTC] leokira997: you already know the reasons why we dont like phil
[2017-05-03 01:33:16 UTC] leokira997: you just dont want to acknowledge them
[2017-05-03 01:33:18 UTC] sanguinenite: none of those are "reasons" they are lame excuses that hold no water
[2017-05-03 01:33:19 UTC] kinggoken: NO DISCUSSION OF HATERS AND/OR HATER VIDS. Discussion of this on stream chat derails the entire chat and distracts everyone. These people do not need promotion and therefore discussion of this topic is not allowed on the stream.
[2017-05-03 01:33:37 UTC] sanguinenite: That is only when the stream is live
[2017-05-03 01:33:41 UTC] leokira997: ^
[2017-05-03 01:34:11 UTC] kinggoken: dsp could easily get those channels shut down though
[2017-05-03 01:34:29 UTC] sanguinenite: The chat is now only for me and the haters, dont worry when the late night stream shuts, I will stop talking since the chat is going to be closed anyway
[2017-05-03 01:35:50 UTC] thadoril: inst the reason you hate him cause he said something mean about you 7 years ago and being the loser that you are cant get over it and move on with your life sad as it may be .
[2017-05-03 01:36:14 UTC] thadoril: grow up stop having nightmares about a man you hate move on
[2017-05-03 01:36:24 UTC] sanguinenite: the haters want me to stop exposing their irrationality so that is why Leokira wants me to stop exposing the haters
[2017-05-03 01:36:28 UTC] zachty200: lol thadoril
[2017-05-03 01:36:36 UTC] leokira997: the main thing as to why i do not like phil is that he expects his fans to pay his bills, while it is true that people who do this for a living rely on their viewers to keep them going, phil however is in a situation where he claims he does not know if he will be able to pay his bills
[2017-05-03 01:36:36 UTC] sanguinenite: @Thadoril who are you talking to lol?
[2017-05-03 01:36:42 UTC] thadoril: haters
[2017-05-03 01:36:50 UTC] thadoril: in general
[2017-05-03 01:37:02 UTC] sanguinenite: I agree, they need to visit a mental hospital
[2017-05-03 01:38:39 UTC] sanguinenite: Phil can claim anything he wants, it is my choice to believe it or not. So far, you know that I am no subscriber or tipper so what's the issue?
[2017-05-03 01:38:46 UTC] thadoril: what do you care do you give him money leo if not move on its not your business what anyone does with THERE money
[2017-05-03 01:38:53 UTC] sanguinenite: ^
[2017-05-03 01:39:00 UTC] leokira997: his first thought as to what he should do is ask his fans to support him by tipping him, cheering, subbing, pledging to patreon and watching his videos. he also asks his fans for suggestions on what else he should do, people bring up he should get a job and he responds with "the only jobs around here are fast food jobs" which im sorry but if you claim you do not know if you can pay your bills you take whatever job you can get
[2017-05-03 01:39:33 UTC] darksydephil: oh look
[2017-05-03 01:39:35 UTC] darksydephil: an idiot
[2017-05-03 01:39:38 UTC] darksydephil: goodbye, idiot
[2017-05-03 01:39:40 UTC] leokira997: no
[2017-05-03 01:39:45 UTC] darksydephil: yes
[2017-05-03 01:39:56 UTC] sanguinenite: lolol nice one
[2017-05-03 01:40:12 UTC] thadoril: lol
[2017-05-03 01:40:14 UTC] darksydephil: incorrigible children
[2017-05-03 01:40:31 UTC] zachty200: good job phil
[2017-05-03 01:43:10 UTC] darksydephil: both channels still under review. at least some progress today
[2017-05-03 01:44:00 UTC] darksydephil: setting up for Danganronpa now. only thing im worried about, the game doesn't always have great save points and whatever i'm playing on earlier stream tomorrow is also on ps4, so ic an't leave it in suspend mode. Hmm
[2017-05-03 01:44:14 UTC] zachty200: i hope everything works out for you phil
[2017-05-03 01:44:31 UTC] darksydephil: thanks, me too
[2017-05-03 01:45:27 UTC] deep_drive: Yeah I remember back when you did danganronpa at first there were times when you had to stream an hour over what you wanted to
[2017-05-03 01:45:32 UTC] emanwazz: I haven't seen Danganrompa yet this should be interesting
[2017-05-03 01:47:21 UTC] deep_drive: I would advise you to stop BEFORE you start the class trial
[2017-05-03 01:47:32 UTC] deep_drive: and do the class trial in one whole segment
[2017-05-03 01:48:15 UTC] deep_drive: because it might take an entire session of gameplay
[2017-05-03 01:52:16 UTC] deep_drive: dspHmm the problem is you might be somewhat close to a class trial since I think when you start now you are at the evidence collecting stage for the trial
[2017-05-03 01:55:44 UTC] darksydephil: yup lol
[2017-05-03 01:55:49 UTC] darksydephil: and you cannot save at ALL during a trial, right?
[2017-05-03 01:55:52 UTC] darksydephil: if so, that's awful
[2017-05-03 01:56:23 UTC] deep_drive: yeah i believe you can save during a trial
[2017-05-03 01:56:51 UTC] deep_drive: hopefully it doesn't make you restart it though
[2017-05-03 01:58:14 UTC] deep_drive: but yeah I'm pretty sure you can save anywhere in the middle of the trial
[2017-05-03 01:58:20 UTC] akioartorius: hi
[2017-05-03 01:58:27 UTC] deep_drive: hey there akioartorius
[2017-05-03 01:58:39 UTC] deep_drive: hows it going?
[2017-05-03 01:58:43 UTC] akioartorius: That was just a test because I thought it was sub only
[2017-05-03 01:58:51 UTC] darksydephil: not yet lol
[2017-05-03 01:59:03 UTC] darksydephil: i might just leave it open and close the chat altogehter as i play
[2017-05-03 01:59:15 UTC] akioartorius: ok that sound cool
[2017-05-03 01:59:25 UTC] sanguinenite: Yup the haters are going to come to spoil the story
[2017-05-03 01:59:58 UTC] deep_drive: It'd probably be best if you don't look at the chat at all so you avoid spoilers
[2017-05-03 02:00:07 UTC] yacherdy: Is it sub only yet?
[2017-05-03 02:00:15 UTC] yacherdy: TriHard
[2017-05-03 02:00:17 UTC] yacherdy: I'm in
[2017-05-03 02:00:25 UTC] akioartorius: Irony I just rewatched DR 3 yesterday
[2017-05-03 02:00:30 UTC] deep_drive: It'd suck if people spoiled the chat for us though
[2017-05-03 02:00:36 UTC] deep_drive: You could put it in followers only mode
[2017-05-03 02:01:03 UTC] yacherdy: If I were Deep and I was a weeb i'd change my name to Weeb_Drive
[2017-05-03 02:01:04 UTC] yacherdy: 10/10
[2017-05-03 02:01:06 UTC] garlicshrimp: i thought he said its going to be sub only mode chat
[2017-05-03 02:01:20 UTC] deep_drive: Lol this is sure a weeb game cherdy
[2017-05-03 02:01:26 UTC] yacherdy: SeemsGood
[2017-05-03 02:01:38 UTC] akioartorius: He just typed in the chat that he may consider open chat but closed on his side.
[2017-05-03 02:02:58 UTC] darksydephil: well waht do you guys think
[2017-05-03 02:03:04 UTC] darksydephil: followers only? because they'll just follow then
[2017-05-03 02:03:09 UTC] darksydephil: or i can do sub only but then it sgonna be quiet lol
[2017-05-03 02:03:14 UTC] darksydephil: or i can just leave it open
[2017-05-03 02:03:55 UTC] deep_drive: yeah i think they have to follow for like 30 minutes or so to chat
[2017-05-03 02:04:03 UTC] yacherdy: yes its 30 minutes
[2017-05-03 02:04:07 UTC] raikumo93: Open might warrant spoilers.
[2017-05-03 02:04:09 UTC] emanwazz: I would say leave it open but then you have people that might come in and spoil it
[2017-05-03 02:04:15 UTC] zachty200: sub only is fine
[2017-05-03 02:04:26 UTC] sanguinenite: yeah followers only sounds good, or close the chat entirely, call is yours
[2017-05-03 02:04:26 UTC] darksydephil: im gonna set it to followers only for tonight then
[2017-05-03 02:04:26 UTC] tourwithme: hmm
[2017-05-03 02:04:37 UTC] deep_drive: theres no mods here so i'd rather not leave it completely open
[2017-05-03 02:04:37 UTC] darksydephil: i will be closing the chat for me, but i want you guys to be able to chat
[2017-05-03 02:04:41 UTC] darksydephil: so FYI, chat at your own risk
[2017-05-03 02:04:53 UTC] yacherdy: no mods NotLikeThis

[2017-05-03 02:09:18 UTC] thepastryarchy: Phil, for Nioh tomorrow, try the guardian spirit, "Suzaku". It auto-releases your spirit upon death and saves you as long as it's charged. You can charge the spirit ahead of time using spirit stones
[2017-05-03 02:09:21 UTC] yacherdy: is rasslin' good right now? Haven't watched in 3 months
[2017-05-03 02:09:30 UTC] deep_drive: well ive enjoyed watching phil play the game thus far yacherdy

[2017-05-03 18:13:39 UTC] errnoent: I think the reason most of these guys hate on Phil is that Phil isn't afraid to suggest that the game needs improvements, while the other guys have this strange self-loathing thing going on where they can only fault themselves
[2017-05-03 18:13:53 UTC] capstonecommune: We dont hate phil

[2017-05-03 18:16:08 UTC] jwalker70: That's an odd demand
[2017-05-03 18:16:09 UTC] capstonecommune: the car being swapped out was good step
[2017-05-03 18:16:21 UTC] capstonecommune: ill invest in something doing everything it should n__n
[2017-05-03 18:16:45 UTC] bentboxer: burn down the condo... we dont need no water let the mother burn... burn mother burn!

[2017-05-03 18:17:51 UTC] errnoent: Uber driver is not a great idea. If you're scraping by it can float you for a while but it's terrible long-term

[2017-05-03 18:18:41 UTC] darksydephil: Uber is great for healthy people. not people with bad backs. one of the reasons my back is better is because i dont drive much. ive said this a bunch of times too, but apparently people don't listen
[2017-05-03 18:18:54 UTC] errnoent: I live in one of the top 5 most populous cities in the US and it's still not a great idea

[2017-05-03 18:20:15 UTC] xgameofpwns: Being tolerant of cultures is a Jewish invention for the goyim but jews themselves are very xenophobic. Just look at Israel
[2017-05-03 18:20:17 UTC] danielsvenson1: yeah "grass" as in mary jane

[2017-05-03 20:19:28 UTC] hapticbabyman: It's not Latveria it's Laveria
[2017-05-03 20:19:32 UTC] rauzito_23: Gundyr is indeed a champion
[2017-05-03 20:19:40 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Yeah Latveria is Dr. Dooms island
[2017-05-03 20:19:45 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I was making a joke
[2017-05-03 20:19:45 UTC] lvlpower: @Derichloveslemur should do it more often if I'm late to the streams only
[2017-05-03 20:19:55 UTC] bammbino: did you all see the new game "Code: Vein"? its a vampire souls game by namco bandai
[2017-05-03 20:20:04 UTC] kovorus: not in wwe i'd say
[2017-05-03 20:20:11 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But seriously, that is actually in the comics
[2017-05-03 20:20:16 UTC] rauzito_23: @deep_drive One shoted? ye old off screen grinding, I see
[2017-05-03 20:20:23 UTC] bobbi_ling: vampire souls PogChamp
[2017-05-03 20:20:37 UTC] phoenixrising2015: That if there was ever a serious problem, Nick Fury's plan is to drop Hulk on one side of Latveria and The Punisher on the other
[2017-05-03 20:20:42 UTC] hapticbabyman: Code:Vein looks pretty neat but I'm kind of getting tired of seeing Soulsborne esque games all the time
[2017-05-03 20:20:44 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and then send in clean up crews afterwards
[2017-05-03 20:20:53 UTC] duwap__kaine: copyright strikes?
[2017-05-03 20:21:05 UTC] bobbyhill187: MingLee

[2017-05-03 20:22:09 UTC] shapedflury: Anyone here in the chat?
[2017-05-03 20:22:13 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015 KO is such a loser cause he attacks Y2J after the match and might have a broken neck.
[2017-05-03 20:22:15 UTC] hapticbabyman: Part of what makes the Souls games special is they were one of a kind. Now every other game wants to be like them; the market'll get bored of the formula due to over saturation
[2017-05-03 20:22:27 UTC] sanguinenite: anyone can claim that they are the guy but he wanted to stay anonymous so...
[2017-05-03 20:22:28 UTC] bobbyhill187: guys got more money than he gives a shit about Kappa

[2017-05-03 20:24:00 UTC] tantamounter: she was streaming when people with guns broke in i think

[2017-05-03 20:24:17 UTC] bobbi_ling: is there character creation in code vein or you play the boy in trailer?
[2017-05-03 20:24:19 UTC] shapedflury: There was once someone who wanted to troll a streamer by donating $50,000 and Paypal refused to refund his money back. Lol
[2017-05-03 20:24:23 UTC] sanguinenite: name of this female streamer?

[2017-05-03 20:24:38 UTC] tantamounter: KappaPride
[2017-05-03 20:24:41 UTC] sanguinenite: @ShapedFlury lol they were a complete moron

[2017-05-03 20:24:56 UTC] deep_drive: they don't put up with that shit
[2017-05-03 20:24:58 UTC] sanguinenite: Paypal sides with streamers
[2017-05-03 20:25:01 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I thought paypal always goes with the customer?
[2017-05-03 20:25:02 UTC] derichloveslemur: everyone is the stream is awesome
[2017-05-03 20:25:17 UTC] bobbyhill187: @derichloveslemur so are you bud InuyoFace
[2017-05-03 20:25:25 UTC] bobbi_ling: i hear kodama party
[2017-05-03 20:25:27 UTC] sanguinenite: no paypal is siding with the sellers more often than not unless it is ultra clear that the seller is being dishonest
[2017-05-03 20:25:28 UTC] deep_drive: not with streaming theycallmejimbob
[2017-05-03 20:25:30 UTC] duwap__kaine: yea fuck off @fakenews

[2017-05-03 20:25:56 UTC] sanguinenite: @Derichloveslemur thx dude
[2017-05-03 20:26:10 UTC] shapedflury: They will not side with the seller most times unless the credit card is stolen.
[2017-05-03 20:26:12 UTC] rauzito_23: I would be so pissed
[2017-05-03 20:26:23 UTC] bobbi_ling: GivePLZ Kappu
[2017-05-03 20:26:24 UTC] bobbyhill187: how do you even "troll a tip"
[2017-05-03 20:26:24 UTC] derichloveslemur: @sanguinenite favorite WWE Wrestler?
[2017-05-03 20:26:25 UTC] rauzito_23: but the guy is a moron, he kinda deserves it
[2017-05-03 20:26:36 UTC] kovorus: Is he on break or did something happen?
[2017-05-03 20:26:45 UTC] akioartorius: break

[2017-05-03 20:27:23 UTC] sanguinenite: @ShapedFlury Wrong, I know that Paypal sides with the seller unless it is clear that the seller has not sent the item or the item was not as described
[2017-05-03 20:27:27 UTC] deep_drive: yes Kovorus
[2017-05-03 20:27:40 UTC] kovorus: @sanguinenite = biggest wrestling fan in here
[2017-05-03 20:28:06 UTC] theycallmejimbob: so if you made a mistake with a tip and tipped 100 bucks instead of 10 you have no way of getting it back with paypal Deep_Drive damn
[2017-05-03 20:28:13 UTC] sanguinenite: For streaming, Paypal always sides with streamers
[2017-05-03 20:28:17 UTC] bobbi_ling: sang watching those burly men in knickers Kreygasm

[2017-05-03 20:30:15 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like her fans really showed their appreciation
[2017-05-03 20:30:21 UTC] shapedflury: @sanguinenite If someone donates $1000 to Phil and the credit card used was stolen, it's considered fraud and Paypal will work to refund the money to the card's original owner. It's like some kid who stole his mom's credit card and donated $50,000 and now she is in debt because of him.
[2017-05-03 20:30:34 UTC] sanguinenite: Only if it is fraud
[2017-05-03 20:30:36 UTC] itsreallyhustho: Like 40 minutes passed wth

[2017-05-03 20:30:50 UTC] deep_drive: Don't tip 100 dollars if you only wanted to tip 10
[2017-05-03 20:30:52 UTC] kovorus: 40 min break
[2017-05-03 20:30:53 UTC] gxpopcorn69: GOOD

[2017-05-03 20:31:16 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey @chocolaterampage30
[2017-05-03 20:31:17 UTC] sanguinenite: but let us be honest, how many people watching gaming streams are parents? and how many parents are dumb enough to just let their credit cards sit around for their ADD child to use?
[2017-05-03 20:31:19 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: he needs to continue his legacy, dood!
[2017-05-03 20:31:20 UTC] rauzito_23: He's bACK

[2017-05-03 20:33:03 UTC] hapticbabyman: the hold's usually only for 3-4 weeks
[2017-05-03 20:33:09 UTC] shapedflury: @sanguinenite Their kids are watching streamers, not the parents. They don't need to leave their credit cards wandering around the house for their kid to take it and spend the money on it.
[2017-05-03 20:33:12 UTC] encelor: @DarksydePhil was the 150$ tip a fraude/troll?
[2017-05-03 20:33:17 UTC] biohazard_asian1: Can someone unban Biohazard_Asian? main account has been gone for like 2 years now lol

[2017-05-03 20:35:25 UTC] hapticbabyman: @encelor yeah that's one of the only times. If it's with paypal credit tho they generally side with sellers unless the person sending the money can prove they were ripped off
