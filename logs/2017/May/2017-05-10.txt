[2017-05-10 00:43:47 UTC] juubeithehoobae: np
[2017-05-10 00:47:28 UTC] zahvone: Apparently my thread is disinteresting.
[2017-05-10 00:47:43 UTC] jlawlar: it almost 9pm
[2017-05-10 00:47:52 UTC] zahvone: There's a lot of people, still though. Lol
[2017-05-10 00:48:47 UTC] zahvone: I'm just very sensitive, honestly.
[2017-05-10 01:25:22 UTC] sanguinenite: Your thread @Zahvone what do you mean?
[2017-05-10 01:41:00 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey guys!
[2017-05-10 01:41:42 UTC] zahvone: Hey
[2017-05-10 01:41:52 UTC] darksydephil: sigh
[2017-05-10 01:41:54 UTC] darksydephil: this is ridiculous
[2017-05-10 01:42:02 UTC] darksydephil: im screwed again, and its all youtubes fault. again.
[2017-05-10 01:42:07 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil what happened?
[2017-05-10 01:42:19 UTC] darksydephil: well i went back with Curse, because that partnership was going well
[2017-05-10 01:42:42 UTC] derichloveslemur: Oh you went back to curse?
[2017-05-10 01:42:46 UTC] darksydephil: but youtube auto-unmonetized all of my videos and due to a bug, i can't bulk-monetize them. they expect me to MANUALLY enable ads on 43k videos one at a time
[2017-05-10 01:42:54 UTC] darksydephil: and youtube help is looking into it but says it could take days to figure out
[2017-05-10 01:43:24 UTC] the_g4spharaoh: so do it then Phil
[2017-05-10 01:43:25 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil That sucks man I feel ya
[2017-05-10 01:43:28 UTC] clesstheangei: welp good luck
[2017-05-10 01:44:17 UTC] derichloveslemur: I wonder what the plans in today's Persona 5 are gonna be.
[2017-05-10 01:44:26 UTC] zahvone: Hm
[2017-05-10 01:44:31 UTC] darksydephil: yeah the bug is so fucking stupid. it just says "edit in process" and has for a week since i bulk monetized the videos last week
[2017-05-10 01:44:45 UTC] darksydephil: all the videos have ads, but the "process" never completed. so i can't do another one
[2017-05-10 01:44:50 UTC] zahvone: I've run into that before, Phil
[2017-05-10 01:44:55 UTC] zahvone: The problem is that you have SO many videos
[2017-05-10 01:45:00 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil So will you have to archive the streams again??
[2017-05-10 01:45:09 UTC] zahvone: and Youtube can only manage so many videos an hour :l
[2017-05-10 01:45:15 UTC] darksydephil: WHY youtube bulk unmonetized all of my videos when i repartnered with curse makes zero sense. it should have kept the fuckig settings
[2017-05-10 01:45:38 UTC] soulrider95: Well it has to put them under a new ad account
[2017-05-10 01:45:40 UTC] soulrider95: instead of adsense
[2017-05-10 01:45:45 UTC] soulrider95: right?
[2017-05-10 01:45:52 UTC] derichloveslemur: @akioartorius @Zahvone @the_g4spharaoh How are you buds doing today?
[2017-05-10 01:45:53 UTC] clesstheangei: better get started then phil, lol. You got 43,000 videos to add ads on
[2017-05-10 01:45:55 UTC] zahvone: Well, try not to worry about it so much for now - just focus on streaming, alright?
[2017-05-10 01:45:57 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey @ClessTheAngeI
[2017-05-10 01:46:05 UTC] zahvone: Doing pretty good. Still setting up this GTA V server @Derichloveslemur
[2017-05-10 01:46:12 UTC] clesstheangei: wat up derich
[2017-05-10 01:46:19 UTC] darksydephil: theres no way im putting ads on 43k videos. it takes almost a minute PER video
[2017-05-10 01:46:25 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Zahvone Is GTA V your favorite GTA?
[2017-05-10 01:46:39 UTC] soulrider95: Well I mean youtube is looking into it right?
[2017-05-10 01:46:48 UTC] zahvone: @Derichloveslemur Gameplaywise? Yes. Sountrack wise would be Vice City - but FUN? That's GTA SA
[2017-05-10 01:47:15 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Zahvone Do you know The Setup?
[2017-05-10 01:47:28 UTC] zahvone: I'm afraid I need a little more context than that. :(
[2017-05-10 01:47:44 UTC] sanguinenite: Lol how can that be? How did you manage to bulk monetize the videos the last time you transferred to Curse for the first time.
[2017-05-10 01:48:06 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Zahvone Its called The Setup I think its the ending credits for GTA V
[2017-05-10 01:48:13 UTC] zahvone: Oh, yes.
[2017-05-10 01:48:46 UTC] derichloveslemur: so you know it now cause I gave you more info.

[2017-05-10 01:52:26 UTC] darksydephil: that means youtube is keeping all that ad revenue lol

[2017-05-10 01:55:56 UTC] zahvone: Though, I suppose now that I think about it - perhaps it doesn't fit his audience.
[2017-05-10 01:56:16 UTC] derichloveslemur: @darthvidarviking the statue of liberty and the empire state building are awesome in NYC
[2017-05-10 01:56:21 UTC] sanguinenite: What is that system called Zahvone?

[2017-05-10 03:00:59 UTC] thepastryarchy: I'm kinda guilty of save scumming when it comes to games with really limited inventory and a boss fight that has a very scripted outcome to figure out.

[2017-05-10 17:35:32 UTC] auzziesly47adam: lol
[2017-05-10 17:35:39 UTC] zahvone: I still have transcoding on my videos, so I'm not sure if I'm a Twitch affiliate now, or no-
[2017-05-10 17:35:42 UTC] zahvone: Oh, that would explain it.
[2017-05-10 17:36:23 UTC] zahvone: I wish cherdy would stream sometime
[2017-05-10 17:37:16 UTC] deep_drive: he does stream sometimes zahvone but not often
[2017-05-10 17:37:26 UTC] zahvone: I will change that. Kappa
[2017-05-10 17:39:10 UTC] deep_drive: i thought phil finished prey yesterday Kappa
[2017-05-10 17:39:29 UTC] deep_drive: that means review is today right?
[2017-05-10 17:39:49 UTC] zahvone: hmm
[2017-05-10 17:39:56 UTC] betheallen: i watched the persona stream for the bit war which start at 2something and ended with 10k and i misses the 10k cheer cause stupid archived video and stupid strema crash
[2017-05-10 17:40:06 UTC] betheallen: deep pockets maaaaan

[2017-05-10 17:40:34 UTC] betheallen: nolbert too
[2017-05-10 17:40:38 UTC] sanguinenite: No, the 10000 bit cheer happened DURING the crash
[2017-05-10 17:40:38 UTC] betheallen: even somoan
[2017-05-10 17:40:56 UTC] betheallen: i know and i missed it BECAUSE the crash
[2017-05-10 17:41:10 UTC] zahvone: Sudden realization
[2017-05-10 17:41:12 UTC] sanguinenite: lol but I saw it thru the live chat that didnt crash
[2017-05-10 17:41:26 UTC] zahvone: Bits = Bitcoin and thus world domination. Flawless logic Kappa
[2017-05-10 17:41:50 UTC] sanguinenite: This whole bit shit I am not all that keen on
[2017-05-10 17:41:50 UTC] betheallen: i saw yacherdy was on second stream :D
[2017-05-10 17:42:22 UTC] sanguinenite: I still believe that money and trasactions should be mainly in cash
[2017-05-10 17:42:34 UTC] zahvone: Really?
[2017-05-10 17:42:34 UTC] betheallen: deep and vidar have to be rich to be giving hundreds away everyday though
[2017-05-10 17:43:22 UTC] zahvone: Rich with culture.
[2017-05-10 17:43:23 UTC] zahvone: :D
[2017-05-10 17:43:32 UTC] sanguinenite: Because keeping everything virtual means you cannot take out your property (i.e with cash) no more bank runs
[2017-05-10 17:43:42 UTC] sanguinenite: So the banks will have you by the balls
[2017-05-10 17:43:52 UTC] betheallen: i wish chat would do a good chat war like that on first stream :(
[2017-05-10 17:43:57 UTC] zahvone: I still use banks and such
[2017-05-10 17:43:59 UTC] betheallen: but they got bored of persona
[2017-05-10 17:44:12 UTC] sanguinenite: Banks dont like the fact that you can take your cash out of their system
[2017-05-10 17:44:41 UTC] sanguinenite: So keeping it in virtual is going to solve that problem, they wish to ban cash and I am not accepting that ever
[2017-05-10 17:45:15 UTC] sanguinenite: I too can donate but I dont want to since I am having trouble myself trying to start my own business
[2017-05-10 17:45:28 UTC] sanguinenite: Rich is such a relative term
[2017-05-10 17:45:38 UTC] zahvone: CHERDY

[2017-05-10 19:32:27 UTC] bytegeist: Phil should interact with normal chat as well if something interesting is brought up, not just tips, unless it's trolls of course

[2017-05-10 19:33:08 UTC] stuart360: Whats Phil supposed to interact with?, stream chat is always off topic and never on the game
[2017-05-10 19:33:08 UTC] bytegeist: I know some other streamers who do a lot
[2017-05-10 19:33:33 UTC] bytegeist: I think it creates channel loyalty and make it attractive for people just checking out the stream

[2017-05-10 19:34:27 UTC] kovorus: LOL
[2017-05-10 19:34:32 UTC] stuart360: You have to remember that Phil isn't just a streamer, he uploads to Youtube as well, and i don't think Youtubers will want to watch someone who is constantly talking to stream chat about off topic stuff
[2017-05-10 19:34:33 UTC] vendatus: MingLee
[2017-05-10 19:34:35 UTC] stormforcegamer: Trolls send Phil money... Phil pays bill & continues to make a living playing games... Trolls get pissed & sends Phil more money... Phil says thanks trolls. lol
[2017-05-10 19:34:39 UTC] kovorus: fuckin' trolls dood
[2017-05-10 19:35:10 UTC] bytegeist: What I'm saying maybe is Phil should get into twitch culture, integrate a bit, it doesn't have to do with selling out
[2017-05-10 19:35:16 UTC] vendatus: Kekon3 wants to show you IT SeemsGood

[2017-05-10 19:35:56 UTC] bytegeist: this game is one of the many rip offs of the bioshock formula
[2017-05-10 19:35:58 UTC] stuart360: Well he has been the last couple of months to be fair, its only really this game where Phil has kind of been immersed in the game
[2017-05-10 19:35:58 UTC] bytegeist: it feels
[2017-05-10 19:36:10 UTC] kekon3: Why does no one want to watch some stranger things in my back room

[2017-05-10 19:39:09 UTC] bytegeist: "As their name indicates, Bridge Trolls live under bridges. They seem to appreciate valuable jewels, and are willing to buy them for gold. According to Snow White, trolls do not like horses."
[2017-05-10 19:39:13 UTC] bobbyhill5: he'll read shout outs lol

[2017-05-10 19:40:29 UTC] bytegeist: Well he could change and go that route more
[2017-05-10 19:40:35 UTC] bytegeist: I think people would like to interact with him
[2017-05-10 19:40:39 UTC] kekon3: Bill Nye will be on in the living room
