[2017-05-01 00:32:44 UTC] flyingminister: Well, not any worse than the rest of the game.
[2017-05-01 00:32:50 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: the other two games would have been called "Ride to Hell: 666" and "Ride to Hell: Beatdown"
[2017-05-01 00:32:52 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you did the icecream truck mission and got your save corrupted YaCherdy ?
[2017-05-01 00:33:02 UTC] philtheboss2367: Do the game leave with a cliffhanger?

[2017-05-01 00:33:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: another hour and a half pcgamehunter I think
[2017-05-01 00:34:05 UTC] yacherdy: I used to think GTA III was overrated but until I beat it for the first time I understand why its so revered.
[2017-05-01 00:34:05 UTC] tactical_twitch: you dont want constant music, you will go insane
[2017-05-01 00:34:09 UTC] ripleyatomic: Jeez, did they kill his dog or something?
[2017-05-01 00:34:12 UTC] bethebaby: @kevindeleonisscum Sure sounds like it might be.
[2017-05-01 00:34:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: @theycallmejimbob I don't think i can handle that lol
[2017-05-01 00:34:25 UTC] yacherdy: Maybe they can still patch the game
[2017-05-01 00:34:33 UTC] bethebaby: Well 50 Cent got shot 9 times and lived sooo...
[2017-05-01 00:34:34 UTC] ethershulk: the lighting effects aint that bad, although this is probably why it runs on such low fps
[2017-05-01 00:34:56 UTC] yacherdy: They were going for a realistic approach with no music
[2017-05-01 00:34:56 UTC] blue_blur64: I could see that ether

[2017-05-01 01:16:09 UTC] bethebaby: @Amisbro Yeah the 360's hardware ate ass. Phil went through 8, if you can believe it.

[2017-05-01 01:20:22 UTC] skyfx89: I think you can eat before you stream, along with other things that takes so long. Its not respectful for the viewers to wait so long. Many will also leave and not come back for so long.

[2017-05-01 01:21:32 UTC] blue_blur64: And the only official day off within those 60 days is memorial day
[2017-05-01 01:22:27 UTC] bethebaby: @blue_blur64 I couldn't do that. You can work yourself to death like that. A friend of mine went to the ER for dehydration because he worked 16 hours a day every day for two weeks.
