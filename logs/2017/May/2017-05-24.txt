[2017-05-24 01:12:35 UTC] darhaam: These fanarts are... Awful.
[2017-05-24 01:12:41 UTC] simsimiv: @DarksydePhil Watched your injustice vids and the reason why you struggle comboing after jump ins, is that you need to dial in the string while in the air after pressing the air button. Dial it in, don't mash on one button until you land, just dial early

[2017-05-24 01:17:55 UTC] simsimiv: @DarksydePhil The reason why you struggle comboing from jump ins is that you need to start dialing in the string before you land. Avoid mashing the 1st button before you land as it will register more than once.
[2017-05-24 01:18:02 UTC] enthuse_: Yeah deathstroke in the arrow tv series is badass I agree

It was legit like The speed force was going to treat him well for his actions and atonement as they made his mother appear as the guide, and she took his hand and gently brought him in like "Its going to be ok"
