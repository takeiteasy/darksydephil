[2017-05-19 20:32:01 UTC] pcgamehunter: I can barely handle maid cafe's in anime, I can only imagine how cringy that shit is in real life WutFace
[2017-05-19 20:32:07 UTC] phoenixrising2015: When I saw the card emblem I thought it meant the Velvet Room
[2017-05-19 20:32:17 UTC] kekon3: Yeah, to start her link, you need to buy her phoney Rock, then visit her 3 more times with enough charm
[2017-05-19 20:32:17 UTC] jx136: @JaxunHero alright thanks
[2017-05-19 20:32:23 UTC] encelor: when i go to vacations i never like going to big cities crowded places feels like i am working i need me some nature
[2017-05-19 20:32:25 UTC] jaxunhero: @pcgamehunter it's not so bad
[2017-05-19 20:32:32 UTC] pcgamehunter: WutFace
[2017-05-19 20:32:33 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Thank you
[2017-05-19 20:32:36 UTC] kekon3: She's a pain in the ass to start early game
[2017-05-19 20:32:58 UTC] pcgamehunter: I'd rather just head straight into the eroge store than be seen around a maid cafe MingLee
[2017-05-19 20:33:14 UTC] pcgamehunter: Also in those stores I assume most people don't make eye contact Kappa
[2017-05-19 20:33:22 UTC] sonicwe: you just need kindness
[2017-05-19 20:33:25 UTC] jaxunhero: @pcgamehunter why not go to an wrote store with maids?
[2017-05-19 20:33:33 UTC] kekon3: Lol, everyone here who wants to go to akihabara, Super Potato is the place to go, they sell old console rarities
[2017-05-19 20:33:47 UTC] kekon3: Though I hear lately that it's getting cleaned out as of late :(
[2017-05-19 20:33:58 UTC] pcgamehunter: Jaxun starting to sound like some sleezy seller in china Kappa
[2017-05-19 20:33:58 UTC] simpo98: Sup Folks did i miss the stream dspEw dspEw
[2017-05-19 20:34:04 UTC] pcgamehunter: break

[2017-05-19 20:34:14 UTC] simpo98: ah got ya

[2017-05-19 20:34:23 UTC] pcgamehunter: BREAK -discussion- Kreygasm

[2017-05-19 20:34:28 UTC] pcgamehunter: Oh wait this isn't Dangaronpa Kappa
[2017-05-19 20:34:49 UTC] jaxunhero: @pcgamehunter or is it? Kappa
[2017-05-19 20:34:51 UTC] pcgamehunter: can I see the inside of those capacitors Kappa
[2017-05-19 20:34:52 UTC] kekon3: I'm enjoying Paladins and warframe, those are f2p
[2017-05-19 20:34:58 UTC] sonicwe: also get futaba to ranks 5 , 7 , and 10 she kaja's the team with buffs and refills sp and hp and at 10 she blocks a fatal hit to the party
[2017-05-19 20:35:01 UTC] pcgamehunter: And test those memory cards ?
[2017-05-19 20:35:14 UTC] pcgamehunter: Oh no, nonono speak engrish DAESuppy
[2017-05-19 20:35:19 UTC] pcgamehunter: :P
[2017-05-19 20:35:33 UTC] phoenixrising2015: So is this Persona day specific or did Phil need a break from Injustice?
[2017-05-19 20:35:38 UTC] epicnessunleashedcontent: Do people watch streams of Paladins?
[2017-05-19 20:35:40 UTC] sonicwe: break
[2017-05-19 20:35:44 UTC] pcgamehunter: Futaba is the best teammate link, since she's always active
[2017-05-19 20:35:54 UTC] kekon3: Injustice break, but he does want to play persona
[2017-05-19 20:36:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he's playing it for the 2nd stream Phoenix he wanted to mix it up today
[2017-05-19 20:36:01 UTC] sonicwe: 1 of the best
[2017-05-19 20:36:05 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Oh ok
[2017-05-19 20:36:07 UTC] phoenixrising2015: thank you
[2017-05-19 20:36:19 UTC] xgameofpwns: @Phoenixrising2015 idk why he isn't playing injustice..He'd have like 4x the viewers
[2017-05-19 20:36:24 UTC] kekon3: Like, I'm always sm wondering why Nier hasn't come back, but I'm thinking maybe he didn't like the game :(
[2017-05-19 20:36:31 UTC] phoenixrising2015: When he plays a deadshot hes going to lose it
[2017-05-19 20:36:39 UTC] xthewrath93x: where is phil
[2017-05-19 20:36:41 UTC] phoenixrising2015: If that Deadshot is any good that is
[2017-05-19 20:36:42 UTC] pcgamehunter: Honestly Futaba is the most useful two, with ultra charge :P
[2017-05-19 20:36:50 UTC] lvlpower: @phoenixrising2015 Phil didn't want it to to be burned out with injustice 2
[2017-05-19 20:37:09 UTC] sonicwe: also neir has too many damn endings
[2017-05-19 20:37:12 UTC] pcgamehunter: I'm pretty sure she saved my bacon on the extra boss in NG+
[2017-05-19 20:37:14 UTC] thetruthowhy: whats he playing?
[2017-05-19 20:37:24 UTC] lvlpower: Persona 5
[2017-05-19 20:37:30 UTC] thetruthowhy: :(
[2017-05-19 20:37:34 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Seriously, if anyone hasn't seen Deadshot, look up gameplay of him beating people
[2017-05-19 20:37:37 UTC] thetruthowhy: no injustice
[2017-05-19 20:37:40 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Phil is going to lose his mind
[2017-05-19 20:37:41 UTC] jaxunhero: @kekon3 he liked Neir it's just the thought of doing 3 playthroughs for a true ending was off putting and he had no rime remember
[2017-05-19 20:37:41 UTC] pcgamehunter: I played Nier for like 5m I thought hmm try on hard ..... guess what happened MingLee
[2017-05-19 20:37:42 UTC] kekon3: Nier Automata isn't that bad to play though, the "play the game 3 times" is kinda a lie, the game is different every time
[2017-05-19 20:37:49 UTC] pcgamehunter: I need to get back into it
[2017-05-19 20:37:55 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The only way to get in is EX Roll or an air rush attack if you have one
[2017-05-19 20:38:00 UTC] pcgamehunter: Keyboard and mouse controls tho FailFish
[2017-05-19 20:38:07 UTC] lvlpower: Phil will be playing injustice 2 tonight stream dspBatphil
[2017-05-19 20:38:12 UTC] kysen: wtf persona out of nowhere, almost missed the stream
[2017-05-19 20:38:12 UTC] kekon3: It's got good controller support though
[2017-05-19 20:38:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he's playing it for the 2nd stream thetruthowhy
[2017-05-19 20:38:30 UTC] kekon3: There's something that happens around the end of Nier automata that makes me want to see Phil play it.
[2017-05-19 20:38:34 UTC] thetruthowhy: ok, guess most of you are from the fgc?
[2017-05-19 20:38:37 UTC] jaxunhero: @kekon3 yes you're right but remember there's only 1 Phil and he's already always out of time lol
[2017-05-19 20:38:44 UTC] lvlpower: dspGlitch the night is still young dspBatphil
[2017-05-19 20:38:59 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The only difference between Deadshot and Deathstroke is once you get close, Deadshot can take damage
[2017-05-19 20:39:03 UTC] kekon3: I'm still in the Fgc, but I mostly run the smash events now a days in my scene :/
[2017-05-19 20:39:04 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Deathstroke had the sword
[2017-05-19 20:39:05 UTC] jaxunhero: @kysen you missed the 1st half of the stream already
[2017-05-19 20:39:28 UTC] kekon3: @phoenixrising2015 dead shot has a really good low that is positive on block
[2017-05-19 20:39:35 UTC] thetruthowhy: i think most of the people who watch phil are from the fgc
[2017-05-19 20:39:42 UTC] kekon3: Spammable, combos into itself, can get confirmed into combos
[2017-05-19 20:39:42 UTC] pcgamehunter: I think it's less than half, doesn't he still have like 2.5
[2017-05-19 20:39:54 UTC] xthewrath93x: ive bene using aquaman hes good
[2017-05-19 20:39:57 UTC] kysen: @JaxunHero fps :(
[2017-05-19 20:40:02 UTC] kysen: damn
[2017-05-19 20:40:06 UTC] kysen: auto correct
[2017-05-19 20:40:13 UTC] kekon3: Aquaman is good but rip scoops
[2017-05-19 20:40:16 UTC] pcgamehunter: fml i presume :P ?
[2017-05-19 20:40:19 UTC] kekon3: They nerfed that shit
[2017-05-19 20:40:31 UTC] xthewrath93x: what?
[2017-05-19 20:40:34 UTC] xthewrath93x: you mean
[2017-05-19 20:40:37 UTC] xthewrath93x: nerfed
[2017-05-19 20:41:03 UTC] pcgamehunter: I just realized i have sniper ghost warrior 3 this whole time MingLee
[2017-05-19 20:41:07 UTC] kekon3: Scoops used to launch enemies behind them mid combo, now it launches outward
[2017-05-19 20:41:22 UTC] pcgamehunter: on*
[2017-05-19 20:41:31 UTC] xthewrath93x: smh
[2017-05-19 20:41:35 UTC] kysen: injustice 2 is my first netherealm fighter and wow do the default controls suck
[2017-05-19 20:41:38 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You know what makes me sad
[2017-05-19 20:41:44 UTC] kysen: no diagonals wtf
[2017-05-19 20:41:48 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Injustice 2 has no ZOOM COSTUME
[2017-05-19 20:41:51 UTC] jaxunhero: @kysen all you missed were futaba joining the team, troll lobsters, sushi lunch, Charm hunting and now we're in Akihabara with futaba
[2017-05-19 20:41:52 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I want the black suit
[2017-05-19 20:41:56 UTC] phoenixrising2015: red logo
[2017-05-19 20:41:57 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Thats all
[2017-05-19 20:42:04 UTC] kekon3: They put vixen in the game though EleGiggle EleGiggle
[2017-05-19 20:42:23 UTC] jaxunhero: @kysen also the Sun arcana has been MAXED
[2017-05-19 20:42:38 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Zoom catching all the bullets in the police station was so hardcore
[2017-05-19 20:42:42 UTC] phoenixrising2015: While holding Flash's body
[2017-05-19 20:42:47 UTC] kekon3: I really like what maxing links does to the cutscenes in this game
[2017-05-19 20:42:49 UTC] lvlpower: I'm going to wait for injustice 2 price drop
[2017-05-19 20:43:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I mean, yeah it was upsetting and I'm a Flash fan but that entire scene was so awesome
[2017-05-19 20:43:07 UTC] kekon3: My friends plan on renting it so they can play with me
[2017-05-19 20:43:12 UTC] xthewrath93x: were has DSP gone
[2017-05-19 20:43:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Zoom literally dragging Flash's body through the city
[2017-05-19 20:43:20 UTC] jaxunhero: @kekon3 watch a mean?
[2017-05-19 20:43:23 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and going "This is your hero! Look at him!"
[2017-05-19 20:43:31 UTC] phoenixrising2015: *Flash is essentially dead*
[2017-05-19 20:43:40 UTC] kekon3: There's a few cutscenes that feature your maxed links
[2017-05-19 20:43:49 UTC] kekon3: And it's awesome the more of them you have
[2017-05-19 20:43:55 UTC] jaxunhero: @kekon3 oh
[2017-05-19 20:44:06 UTC] kekon3: Like, in older personas it's just one scene at the end
[2017-05-19 20:44:08 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: Phil's on his break FUCK SwiftRage
[2017-05-19 20:44:28 UTC] kekon3: Also, maxing links is cool
[2017-05-19 20:44:39 UTC] lvlpower: We know what Phil is doing Kreygasm
[2017-05-19 20:44:44 UTC] kekon3: Kreygasm
[2017-05-19 20:44:57 UTC] pray4rock: Injustice stream later?
[2017-05-19 20:45:02 UTC] kekon3: Yeah

[2017-05-19 20:45:14 UTC] jaxunhero: Yee
[2017-05-19 20:45:22 UTC] kekon3: Later tonight, more characters, and some more online
[2017-05-19 20:45:35 UTC] pray4rock: Nice, thanks
[2017-05-19 20:45:50 UTC] kekon3: Anyone wanna bet who Phil is gonna main? My money is he's gonna stick to cold
[2017-05-19 20:45:54 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: how was his mp exp yesterday?
[2017-05-19 20:45:55 UTC] lvlpower: oh boy got a message about the weather changes dspFacepalm
[2017-05-19 20:46:04 UTC] pcgamehunter: actually that happens in persona 4 too
[2017-05-19 20:46:09 UTC] circlejerk001: loosing 800 viewers on this weeb shit
[2017-05-19 20:46:12 UTC] circlejerk001: smh
[2017-05-19 20:46:22 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I think I figured out how Constantine could work in Injustice
[2017-05-19 20:46:24 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's when Izanami "kills" you basically
[2017-05-19 20:46:30 UTC] phoenixrising2015: He calls in monsters for attacks
[2017-05-19 20:46:41 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: Some ppl like persona ,I don't like it tho
[2017-05-19 20:46:42 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like he says something and a monster pops up for an anti air
[2017-05-19 20:46:47 UTC] lvlpower: most people left Phil break is long
[2017-05-19 20:46:55 UTC] phoenixrising2015: or he says something and a monster shoots a projectile
[2017-05-19 20:47:01 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like all he is is just a summoner
[2017-05-19 20:47:20 UTC] availableusername888: ive been watching phils 2009-2011 shit lately, fuck its great, not like these days unfortunately :(
[2017-05-19 20:47:25 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Thats really all I can think Constantine could do if hes in injustice
[2017-05-19 20:47:26 UTC] pray4rock: How long has phil been gone?
[2017-05-19 20:47:39 UTC] encelor: woa how long is the break
[2017-05-19 20:47:47 UTC] pcgamehunter: For years, his clone is on break tho Kreygasm
[2017-05-19 20:47:48 UTC] xgameofpwns: Guys, what would you think of Gehrman as a DLC character for a netherrealm game?
[2017-05-19 20:47:49 UTC] pcgamehunter: Kappa
[2017-05-19 20:47:51 UTC] encelor: been playing 2 matches of gwent
[2017-05-19 20:48:04 UTC] kekon3: @phoenixrising2015 That sounds like the demon dude from Melty blood, his shadows would make demons manifest and he'd use them for mixups
[2017-05-19 20:48:10 UTC] encelor: lost them both Feelsbadman
[2017-05-19 20:48:15 UTC] pcgamehunter: That's short encelor :P
[2017-05-19 20:48:29 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: Phil should play darkseid fav dc villan
[2017-05-19 20:48:29 UTC] pcgamehunter: Unless the full game is a lot different from W3 gwent
[2017-05-19 20:48:43 UTC] encelor: its kind of same
[2017-05-19 20:48:50 UTC] encelor: but i got destroyed
[2017-05-19 20:48:52 UTC] encelor: :(
[2017-05-19 20:49:01 UTC] kekon3: Just preordered tekken 7, feels good man
[2017-05-19 20:49:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: :D
[2017-05-19 20:49:19 UTC] xthewrath93x: did they nerf deadshot at all
[2017-05-19 20:49:23 UTC] pcgamehunter: I hate Nilfgaard neutrality win with a burning passion
[2017-05-19 20:49:25 UTC] sonicwe: what can i say people want action games cant handle story driving games
[2017-05-19 20:49:26 UTC] lvlpower: The odd thing is that I wait Phil is already streaming and I'm still looking at this art I'm like so he's really Kreygasm
[2017-05-19 20:49:27 UTC] kekon3: Gonna play Eliza and Harwong
[2017-05-19 20:49:28 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @Kekon3 Thats really all I can think of for him because he legit is not a fighter. The entire concept they use of him is how he really is in that he uses tricks and manipulation to get things done and exorcises demons and goes into different dimenions to save people. He legit has to rely on other things to win
[2017-05-19 20:50:00 UTC] encelor: anyone hyped for samurai jack last episode tommorow?
[2017-05-19 20:50:07 UTC] encelor: Extraaa thiccccc
[2017-05-19 20:50:12 UTC] lvlpower: yes
[2017-05-19 20:50:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: Because I tried to beat the first dude you play when you visit Emhyr in Vizima, but you can't beat him unless you get better cards first :D
[2017-05-19 20:50:19 UTC] kekon3: I am, but I need to catch up first NotLikeThis NotLikeThis
[2017-05-19 20:50:35 UTC] lvlpower: samurai Jack hype
[2017-05-19 20:50:41 UTC] sonicwe: i was but a lot of questions need to be anwserd in that show 1st
[2017-05-19 20:50:49 UTC] pcgamehunter: And one time I almost beat him, I got fucked by the draw = win ability
[2017-05-19 20:51:06 UTC] akioartorius: pHil is back?
[2017-05-19 20:51:18 UTC] lvlpower: Ulta Thicc Kreygasm
[2017-05-19 20:51:19 UTC] pcgamehunter: nope
[2017-05-19 20:51:39 UTC] pcgamehunter: and if i had the batphil emote i'd go "But he is the bat" Kappa
[2017-05-19 20:51:40 UTC] xthewrath93x: @akioartorius still tugging
[2017-05-19 20:52:17 UTC] lvlpower: g
[2017-05-19 20:52:20 UTC] xthewrath93x: deadshot is so annoying to play goddamn
[2017-05-19 20:52:25 UTC] availableusername888: i think its over, seriously and sadly
[2017-05-19 20:52:27 UTC] akioartorius: didn't fire emblem come out last night?
[2017-05-19 20:52:48 UTC] lvlpower: sticky icky InuyoFace
[2017-05-19 20:53:19 UTC] availableusername888: no passion , might as well figure something else
[2017-05-19 20:53:37 UTC] jcblack1990: Right on time
[2017-05-19 20:54:04 UTC] kysen: @cheer50 was there a week in preview, had no idea this stream was on
[2017-05-19 20:54:15 UTC] pcgamehunter: @DarksydePhil BTW now that Akihabara unlocked, you can visit it just like Yongen and Shibuya. Also you can get collectable plushies from a machine in a game arcade there
[2017-05-19 20:54:46 UTC] akioartorius: no free time until later
[2017-05-19 20:54:49 UTC] jcblack1990: I believe there is a maid cafe in Akihabara that raises charm.
[2017-05-19 20:54:50 UTC] pcgamehunter: ye
[2017-05-19 20:54:51 UTC] kysen: cheer50

[2017-05-19 20:56:27 UTC] lvlpower: swap thing very effective
[2017-05-19 20:56:30 UTC] xgameofpwns: So no injustice online play tonight?
[2017-05-19 20:56:41 UTC] pcgamehunter: Oh and if you get items of Akihabara and the old dude who sold you a TV, you can repair a laptop and find a new mail order store :P
[2017-05-19 20:56:44 UTC] availableusername888: @DarksydePhil yeah spring fucking sucks, allergies and shit i hate it
[2017-05-19 20:57:07 UTC] vidar2smart: hello everyone :) , @DarksydePhil how can i earn a shoutout?
[2017-05-19 20:57:11 UTC] dspfandood: no online play dropped

[2017-05-19 21:54:50 UTC] pcgamehunter: Actually gotta make the eternal lockpick
[2017-05-19 21:54:52 UTC] akioartorius: Does anyone know if a group of jack frosts can gather together and form a King Frost like in Shin Megami Tenshi?
[2017-05-19 21:55:17 UTC] pcgamehunter: But you need Tin plate and something else in large quantity for that tho
[2017-05-19 21:55:25 UTC] pcgamehunter: And the drop rates are SHIT
[2017-05-19 21:55:29 UTC] jaxunhero: @akioartorius don't think so
[2017-05-19 21:55:36 UTC] jcblack1990: Make the eternal lockpick if possible.
[2017-05-19 21:55:43 UTC] pcgamehunter: pretty sure they can't akio
[2017-05-19 21:55:53 UTC] bufubae: King frost is way to high level in this game, that wouldn't happen at this point i think

[2017-05-19 22:00:26 UTC] sonicwe: best advice
[2017-05-19 22:00:44 UTC] akioartorius: @ewojo that is a double edge sword though

[2017-05-19 22:02:40 UTC] akioartorius: use giant slice
[2017-05-19 22:02:52 UTC] bufubae: @DarksydePhil these bosses can have different weaknesses from regular shadows
[2017-05-19 22:02:57 UTC] sonicwe: phil she said that move would work beacause of crit chance
[2017-05-19 22:03:16 UTC] pcgamehunter: Some of them do, some just hide weaknesses and you ahve to remember them

[2017-05-19 22:08:22 UTC] acethesly: if I had subbed back when Phil first streamed on twitch I guess I'd have like a 5 year loyalty badge by now? :P or when did he start? I remember a while back in youtube videos he has the stream on but it had some technical issues at some point too. Glad it's going smooth now.
[2017-05-19 22:08:40 UTC] darthvidarviking: he cae back to twitch in late october

[2017-05-19 22:11:48 UTC] blk_mage_ctype: @pcgamehunter Yeah, but the thing about that is that his students chose to stay when they could have left early on rather than continue to be used or end their lives, whereas the victims of the baddies in Mementos are all trapped.

[2017-05-19 22:30:39 UTC] pcgamehunter: The outfits also are worthless for futaba since the only time you see them is in the beginning of the dungeon since the cutscenes use default outfits

[2017-05-19 22:33:15 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's just ... so obviously a girl doing a young boy voice, I just can't stand it
[2017-05-19 22:33:27 UTC] pcgamehunter: Oh boy, can't wait to hear her eng VA :D
[2017-05-19 22:33:35 UTC] simpo98: So Destiny 2 thoughts folks aye or nah
[2017-05-19 22:33:37 UTC] pcgamehunter: Her JP VA is excellent
[2017-05-19 22:33:37 UTC] bufubae: @pcgamehunter his meowing when brainwashed makes up for it.
[2017-05-19 22:33:45 UTC] kushiyakitori: the way she says persona in battle is so shrill
[2017-05-19 22:33:48 UTC] akioartorius: but some say she is best waifu material?
[2017-05-19 22:33:59 UTC] pcgamehunter: Morgana sounds like a horny cat in the JP VA when brainwashed :D

[2017-05-19 22:35:11 UTC] pcgamehunter: I'd say Ryuji > Makoto > 'Her" in terms of how cool their summon is in the JP ver.
[2017-05-19 22:35:32 UTC] kushiyakitori: cheer10 I think you can open the map and say go to a lower area at any time if you have opened the way down. You don't have to keep stepping out of the car
[2017-05-19 22:35:32 UTC] akioartorius: ult or normal personas @pcgamehunter
[2017-05-19 22:35:48 UTC] pcgamehunter: Normals > max, most of the time

[2017-05-19 22:36:35 UTC] sonicwe: also this plays is random
[2017-05-19 22:36:42 UTC] kushiyakitori: @sonicwe I mean when he opens the last door. It takes more time to walk down the steps then use R1 and go down
[2017-05-19 22:36:44 UTC] sonicwe: place
[2017-05-19 22:37:03 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he's a modern day Robin Hood

[2017-05-19 22:45:19 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's Anzu and Anubis
[2017-05-19 22:45:22 UTC] kushiyakitori: Naga drops something else that is used in them
[2017-05-19 22:45:28 UTC] akioartorius: Phil has Anzu
[2017-05-19 22:45:30 UTC] kushiyakitori: Not the same item. Sorry. I meant a different crafting part
[2017-05-19 22:45:35 UTC] pcgamehunter: I would know because I grinded the bookworm money Thoth by accident :D
[2017-05-19 22:45:40 UTC] sanguinenite: They cant stand how Phil managed to make his hobby a career

[2017-05-19 22:47:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: fuck anubis

[2017-05-19 22:48:11 UTC] pcgamehunter: on both
[2017-05-19 22:48:40 UTC] vlayer: Grinding for crafting items is a lot easier in Mementos since you can just drive over the loot
[2017-05-19 22:49:00 UTC] acethesly: :)
[2017-05-19 22:49:04 UTC] pcgamehunter: True, those weird cages give you crafting items
[2017-05-19 22:49:11 UTC] bufubae: @DarksydePhil Old school abortion
[2017-05-19 22:49:15 UTC] pcgamehunter: But mementos is worse for grinding XP, since the enemies don't group
[2017-05-19 22:49:22 UTC] vlayer: Yes, and then you can use R1 to travel to the enxt floor and respawn items
[2017-05-19 22:49:30 UTC] xthewrath93x: lmao dsp
[2017-05-19 22:49:35 UTC] pcgamehunter: double ISIS Kreygasm
[2017-05-19 22:50:00 UTC] pcgamehunter: Yusuke physical attacks SeemsGood
[2017-05-19 22:50:02 UTC] akioartorius: I am kinda surprised Isis is so low leveled in this game when it was high leveled in previous persona games P3 and P4.
[2017-05-19 22:50:08 UTC] vlayer: Experience is honestly the last thing you need to grind for
[2017-05-19 22:50:17 UTC] pcgamehunter: The levels were moved quite a bit in this one

[2017-05-19 22:51:39 UTC] vlayer: @pcgamehunter I meant more that levels don't matter as much as what kind of Personas you have
[2017-05-19 22:51:40 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter yeah. I actively started avoiding it cause its so bad lol
[2017-05-19 22:51:44 UTC] pcgamehunter: SAME :D

[2017-05-19 22:52:22 UTC] kushiyakitori: @akioartorius I don't like it at all. looks so annoying. maybe its party cause I hate the character
[2017-05-19 22:52:26 UTC] pcgamehunter: But you can tell it uses old assets from early development :D
[2017-05-19 22:52:32 UTC] akioartorius: Don't get too cocky
[2017-05-19 22:52:33 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's cool, but it's bullshit too

[2017-05-19 22:59:34 UTC] jcblack1990: @encelor Doesn't seem to be anything like that in this game tho.
[2017-05-19 22:59:47 UTC] encelor: is the dungeon music distorted or is me dowloading games effecting twitch
[2017-05-19 22:59:58 UTC] bufubae: There is a unique cutscene for fusion accidents

[2017-05-19 23:02:32 UTC] encelor: maybe is a internet connection thing
[2017-05-19 23:02:58 UTC] bufubae: Anubis probably doesn't show up until the 10th floor

[2017-05-19 23:06:01 UTC] jcblack1990: @akioartorius Well in the old games, you can build a certain stat. Its possible to have a persona with all 99 in its stats. With the strengthening persona option in this game, im not sure its possibe for perfect stats. i could be wrong tho.
[2017-05-19 23:06:11 UTC] pcgamehunter: Hope next persona stream is first stream, or I'm gonna have to skip :/
[2017-05-19 23:06:28 UTC] bufubae: It's impossible to max stats in this game
[2017-05-19 23:06:43 UTC] pcgamehunter: it's not
[2017-05-19 23:06:51 UTC] jcblack1990: @bufubae That is what i thought

[2017-05-19 23:07:06 UTC] sanguinenite: You should max out the maid
[2017-05-19 23:07:08 UTC] bufubae: I'm talking about persona stats
[2017-05-19 23:07:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: I maxed the stats, not the links tho
[2017-05-19 23:07:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Oh ok my bad

[2017-05-19 23:07:43 UTC] pcgamehunter: Oh you talking about personas sry
[2017-05-19 23:07:51 UTC] jcblack1990: @encelor Think it depends on the persona.
[2017-05-19 23:07:59 UTC] pcgamehunter: I thought you meant social stats
