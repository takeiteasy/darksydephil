[2017-05-11 01:50:05 UTC] yacherdy: Hello all.
[2017-05-11 01:50:07 UTC] blue_blur64: Hi Phil, first off good job against the boss yesterday. You actually beat it a lot faster than I did despite you screwing up with the 2nd ballista attack :P
[2017-05-11 01:50:34 UTC] blue_blur64: As for tips, you
[2017-05-11 01:51:01 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey @YaCherdy bud!
[2017-05-11 01:51:43 UTC] blue_blur64: You're at the point where being able to organize your skills would help, and you can if you go to each party member's persona and pressing square on the skills and moving them around. You can also do that with every persona you have
[2017-05-11 01:52:09 UTC] zahvone: What o_o
[2017-05-11 01:52:31 UTC] blue_blur64: I normally go spell attack, physical, healing, stat buff/debuff, and passive

[2017-05-11 01:53:56 UTC] blue_blur64: Also, I suggest going to the store right by Leblanc and buying something new that can help you raise stats in a more fun way (plus you'll miss a hang out day with Ryuji if you don't buy it soon).
[2017-05-11 01:54:05 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Ready for Persona tonight?
[2017-05-11 01:54:31 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, but it'd probably be easier for you instead of having to scroll down every time for the stronger spell :P
[2017-05-11 01:55:10 UTC] darksydephil: yeah you mean the laptop right? a bunch of people have told me about that
[2017-05-11 01:55:21 UTC] darksydephil: i just never remember bc every time they tell me, the game doens't give me free time to buy it and i forget lol

[2017-05-11 01:59:47 UTC] blue_blur64: I believe you can't get the laptop until the next city area opens up. I think it's in like the September

[2017-05-11 17:00:59 UTC] errnoent: this weekend I think
[2017-05-11 17:01:09 UTC] errnoent: that's what Phil was saying yesterday anyway
[2017-05-11 17:04:57 UTC] deadpylons: cool and because I`m curious
[2017-05-11 17:05:09 UTC] deadpylons: will he start with the story in injustice 2 or online
[2017-05-11 17:06:23 UTC] errnoent: Who knows. He'll most likely do the story first. I really wanna see him play more online games though
[2017-05-11 17:07:30 UTC] deadpylons: I just wanted to see if what I hear is true about him. The whole "he sucks at fighters" deal
[2017-05-11 17:08:45 UTC] betheallen: i'd say phil is ok at fighters he loses a lot and he wins a lot so down the middle
[2017-05-11 17:09:04 UTC] betheallen: nothing like back in the day when he did it professional though
[2017-05-11 17:10:37 UTC] deadpylons: so you would have to say that he is an average player now compared to before. What did he play professionally before
[2017-05-11 17:11:00 UTC] errnoent: SF2
[2017-05-11 17:11:03 UTC] betheallen: street fighter
[2017-05-11 17:11:35 UTC] errnoent: I think Phil was really good at footsies and reading
[2017-05-11 17:11:51 UTC] errnoent: Newer fighting games depend less and less on those skills
[2017-05-11 17:12:18 UTC] betheallen: if i can win some fights in fighters phil should def be ablle to lol
[2017-05-11 17:12:51 UTC] betheallen: he even has a damn stick whilst i gota controller lol
[2017-05-11 17:13:39 UTC] deadpylons: now adays fighters are about doing awesome strings of combos or atleast that's what I see. Arcade sticks don't make you a good player btw
[2017-05-11 17:13:50 UTC] deadpylons: it is just a play style
[2017-05-11 17:14:43 UTC] betheallen: talking of combos, phil can actually get some out whilst i cant most of the time, my brain forgets em :D
[2017-05-11 17:14:57 UTC] errnoent: Yeah it's a lot of combos but actually what's changed most I think is the variety of moves and how you need to handle them. Characters have more abilities now, multiple styles, different meter mechanics and such. It's a lot harder to be good at fighting games now, because you have to spend so much time learning the character and all of his/her matchups
[2017-05-11 17:15:22 UTC] errnoent: even someone that's excellent at combos will get their shit pushed in by a noob that just spams teleport and a 3-hit combo
[2017-05-11 17:15:31 UTC] deadpylons: agreed.
[2017-05-11 17:15:57 UTC] betheallen: i wouldnt cheat like a asshole though errnoent
[2017-05-11 17:16:02 UTC] errnoent: I know you would bethe
[2017-05-11 17:16:09 UTC] errnoent: You are that guy spamming teleport lol
[2017-05-11 17:16:36 UTC] betheallen: hey batman cannot teleport and harley cant so cannot do it in injustice :P
[2017-05-11 17:16:52 UTC] errnoent: I keep thinking of MKX
[2017-05-11 17:17:25 UTC] deadpylons: I do hope that Dsp does a few online matches before doing the story, mainly because I wanna be a tad bit selfish and get a few rounds in
[2017-05-11 17:17:33 UTC] errnoent: lol
[2017-05-11 17:17:37 UTC] errnoent: that would be entertaining
[2017-05-11 17:17:54 UTC] errnoent: when I used to play FGs, I knew guys that had literally fucking memorized frame data tables
[2017-05-11 17:18:15 UTC] betheallen: phil might do story and online like 50/50 but who knows
[2017-05-11 17:18:31 UTC] betheallen: but he would do story first though
[2017-05-11 17:18:40 UTC] betheallen: actually he might dotraining
[2017-05-11 17:18:52 UTC] deadpylons: I don't know frame data but I do know what is safe and unsafe for characters such as Bane or Bison
[2017-05-11 17:19:41 UTC] deadpylons: He should do a stream training session with viewers
[2017-05-11 17:19:46 UTC] errnoent: Yeah knowing what's safe and not safe is normal, but knowing the frame data difference between two moves of any two given characters in a set of 30 is something else
[2017-05-11 17:20:03 UTC] xthewrath93x: lma
[2017-05-11 17:22:03 UTC] deadpylons: I see that he has a patreon. He could have a goal to do first to 5 matches with people who donate
[2017-05-11 17:22:46 UTC] errnoent: That's a good idea. Hell I might buy a stick and the game if it means I could get some matches on with Phil
[2017-05-11 17:23:31 UTC] deadpylons: i don't know when he streams or even if i will be around when he does but shot the idea to him please

[2017-05-11 17:59:10 UTC] kingjadvcmp: let's be honest, it cannot be considered home-made - if he was making it from fresh ingredients, raw ingredients, absolutely. He buys a can of tomato paste in a shop and pours it into a pan lol. I was expecting more from the sauce before finding out
[2017-05-11 17:59:25 UTC] errnoent: I don't know details about the sauce, is that true kingjad?

[2017-05-11 18:01:51 UTC] errnoent: I think this is something that needs to be addressed in pre-stream
[2017-05-11 18:01:55 UTC] betheallen: jimbob the sauce is a lie, because they put sausabges in it so how can it be sauce
[2017-05-11 18:01:57 UTC] errnoent: the authenticity of phil's sauce

[2017-05-11 18:03:02 UTC] podusmonens: hey jimmy
[2017-05-11 18:03:10 UTC] errnoent: Phil has not considered selling his sauce due to the fact it would be difficult for him to bottle and preserve it
[2017-05-11 18:03:16 UTC] yacherdy: Wait....Cherdy-o's...there we go.
[2017-05-11 18:03:17 UTC] kingjadvcmp: who wants to buy some authentic Italian DSP sauce?
[2017-05-11 18:03:20 UTC] kingjadvcmp: show of hands
[2017-05-11 18:03:22 UTC] sanguinenite: Lazy people exist so thats how things like chef boyardee can be sucessful
[2017-05-11 18:03:23 UTC] betheallen: lets continue the cherdy saying that word convo from yesterday
[2017-05-11 18:03:32 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh boy
[2017-05-11 18:03:33 UTC] podusmonens: I thought you wanted to be in shape, now you're eating cheerios? for SHAME
[2017-05-11 18:03:37 UTC] yacherdy: WRONG
[2017-05-11 18:03:39 UTC] sanguinenite: Not a personal fan of tomatoes, so not for me
[2017-05-11 18:03:48 UTC] yacherdy: it was a mistake and I'm sorry for it
[2017-05-11 18:03:54 UTC] errnoent: now wait a minute, does he use tomato paste from the can or are we talking about like ragu here?
[2017-05-11 18:03:57 UTC] betheallen: cheerios is alright nothing wrong with those
[2017-05-11 18:04:01 UTC] podusmonens: sorry doesn't cut it
[2017-05-11 18:04:03 UTC] yacherdy: @podusmonens I'm just kidding..I don't like cereal
[2017-05-11 18:04:05 UTC] errnoent: because canned tomato paste does not taste much different from homemade
[2017-05-11 18:04:11 UTC] podusmonens: I like oat flakes
[2017-05-11 18:04:11 UTC] sanguinenite: ^
[2017-05-11 18:04:13 UTC] errnoent: and making tomato paste by hand is kind of a pain in the ass
[2017-05-11 18:04:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: maybe it says homemade on the can hmmm
[2017-05-11 18:04:26 UTC] podusmonens: git on your health boi
[2017-05-11 18:04:29 UTC] sanguinenite: @errnoent You are absolutely right, but the troll doesnt get it
[2017-05-11 18:04:32 UTC] betheallen: cherdy has brown bread for breakfast
[2017-05-11 18:04:34 UTC] yacherdy: maybe the meatballs are authentic
[2017-05-11 18:04:39 UTC] yacherdy: maybe bethe

[2017-05-11 18:05:17 UTC] yacherdy: yes dragin
[2017-05-11 18:05:25 UTC] yacherdy: yes bethe
[2017-05-11 18:05:40 UTC] kingjadvcmp: what have I done that has been considered trollish @sanguinenite? We have you who constantly interact with obvious trolls, I think you love the attention from them
[2017-05-11 18:05:45 UTC] yacherdy: btw I've got Aesop Rock queued up.
[2017-05-11 18:05:48 UTC] podusmonens: put down a beat then cocksucka
[2017-05-11 18:05:49 UTC] betheallen: for dinner he has a slice of tomato and if he is lucky a single pea

[2017-05-11 18:06:29 UTC] betheallen: GROUP HUG
[2017-05-11 18:06:36 UTC] sanguinenite: I really think Phil should try to sell his own homemade sauce at a free market. I remember a pretty trollish comment from you directed at me a few days ago so yeah, I think you are a troll. And now you trying to pour cold water down Phil's back, cant blame me for thinking you are a troll, Vlad
[2017-05-11 18:06:40 UTC] yacherdy: GivePLZ
[2017-05-11 18:06:43 UTC] 0megaj0ker: sup guys B)

[2017-05-11 18:07:18 UTC] yacherdy: where's your twin Alphaj0ker
[2017-05-11 18:07:18 UTC] sanguinenite: @KingjadVCMP Oh and btw, There is a difference between interacting and provoking the trolls. I lost interest after a few days of it tho
[2017-05-11 18:07:24 UTC] theycallmejimbob: TakeNRG
[2017-05-11 18:07:29 UTC] kingjadvcmp: would it be HIS sauce though, cos he buys it from a market in first place? That's potentially fraud you're encouraging there @sanguinenite.
[2017-05-11 18:07:32 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Alpha is dead Kappa
[2017-05-11 18:07:36 UTC] yacherdy: hey 0mega :D
[2017-05-11 18:07:40 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I'd made sure of that Kappa
[2017-05-11 18:07:44 UTC] yacherdy: DBstyle
[2017-05-11 18:07:55 UTC] errnoent: It also depends where you live. In Thailand for example you can find hand made curry paste pretty easily, but it doesn't mean you can't make authentic Thai food without it. Some very popular vendors use stuff from the can.
[2017-05-11 18:07:57 UTC] betheallen: what about beta
[2017-05-11 18:08:04 UTC] 0megaj0ker: same thing Kappa
[2017-05-11 18:08:06 UTC] podusmonens: I don't hug men, shieeeeet *mages a disgusted face, revealing his gold grill teeth
[2017-05-11 18:08:12 UTC] sanguinenite: @KingjadVCMP If it is fraud, then no local farmers market should exist. Making a sauce from home and them marketing it as homemade is legal. Goes to show how much you know about business, Vlad
[2017-05-11 18:08:14 UTC] podusmonens: makes*
[2017-05-11 18:08:45 UTC] podusmonens: why are we arguing about selling the sauce?
[2017-05-11 18:08:49 UTC] kingjadvcmp: he has not made the sauce from home. He has made it from a tin of tomato paste. That was my point. Did you watch how he made it?
[2017-05-11 18:08:52 UTC] podusmonens: who brought up this dumbfuck idea?
[2017-05-11 18:09:00 UTC] betheallen: dragin just hug cherdy and i will come from behind then jimmy can join in with the hug and it will be all good
[2017-05-11 18:09:00 UTC] errnoent: cahman podus
[2017-05-11 18:09:18 UTC] kingjadvcmp: look it doesn't matter, it's a moot point - I cannot envisage Phil doing this anyway. It'd be a day off from gaming
[2017-05-11 18:09:21 UTC] sanguinenite: So what? The tin was incorporated into a pot with other ingredients in a home = homemade
[2017-05-11 18:09:36 UTC] yacherdy: MingLee
[2017-05-11 18:09:36 UTC] podusmonens: oh god
[2017-05-11 18:09:41 UTC] yacherdy: this is epic
[2017-05-11 18:09:45 UTC] podusmonens: are we really arguing about this
[2017-05-11 18:09:49 UTC] errnoent: yes we are podus
[2017-05-11 18:09:54 UTC] podusmonens: :D

[2017-05-11 18:10:21 UTC] yacherdy: *takes a sip of starbucks*
[2017-05-11 18:10:25 UTC] yacherdy: ahhh
[2017-05-11 18:10:35 UTC] kingjadvcmp: @sanguinenite you have spent several days arguing and bickering with a lot of different people.
[2017-05-11 18:10:40 UTC] kingjadvcmp: so who is the troll?
[2017-05-11 18:10:51 UTC] podusmonens: starcucks shiet
[2017-05-11 18:10:57 UTC] sanguinenite: Lol the true trolls are the ones that are triggered by my honesty
[2017-05-11 18:11:01 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I am going to ignore you now, because you obviously need and crave the attention. And you've had enough

[2017-05-11 21:56:29 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: It's trying to be fallout but it's falling out of its league
[2017-05-11 21:56:33 UTC] pwnage_101: @breaktheglass That's what I was thinking, too.
[2017-05-11 21:56:50 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: You like that? StoneLightning
[2017-05-11 21:57:33 UTC] pr34ch: cause ben heck opened the switch up and revealed that there would be an upgraded model at some point with more ram

[2017-05-11 21:59:08 UTC] stoemp2: maybe your two wremches
[2017-05-11 21:59:08 UTC] rnrs: the only issue I have with the switch is the lack of info Nintendo is giving with its future features

[2017-05-11 23:25:46 UTC] sanguinenite: It is fine to be emotional as long as it makes sense. Otherwise, it will be boring as shit as this game. Honestly Zah you missed nothing because I was ResidentSleeper
[2017-05-11 23:26:02 UTC] yacherdy: I was listening to music dragin suggested and then I split for a bit.
[2017-05-11 23:26:16 UTC] sanguinenite: most of the time when I did pop in to check if the game was still boring and I was not disappointed
[2017-05-11 23:26:29 UTC] zahvone: lool
[2017-05-11 23:26:43 UTC] podusmonens: I showed you what good lyrical kanthent is

[2017-05-11 23:27:33 UTC] sanguinenite: It seems like a lame imitation of Deus Ex but just not as impressive
[2017-05-11 23:27:50 UTC] podusmonens: I donțt see any deus ex in it
[2017-05-11 23:27:57 UTC] podusmonens: i see maybe some portal

[2017-05-11 23:33:05 UTC] yacherdy: @podusmonens what?
[2017-05-11 23:33:21 UTC] podusmonens: too much action in bioshock 2? meaning less atmosphere?
[2017-05-11 23:33:43 UTC] podusmonens: that's what I remember at least
[2017-05-11 23:33:56 UTC] podusmonens: I was chasing the vibe of the first
[2017-05-11 23:34:03 UTC] yacherdy: oh perhaps...maybe that's why BioShock the original was the best
[2017-05-11 23:34:33 UTC] zahvone: You think so?

[2017-05-11 23:35:04 UTC] podusmonens: sry fatal shadows
