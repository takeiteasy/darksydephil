[2017-05-25 02:28:13 UTC] ajeeverywhere: darksydephil music isn't loud ENOUGH.
[2017-05-25 02:28:43 UTC] roomeo_lolz: alright im guys
[2017-05-25 02:30:27 UTC] furryrabidmoole: darksydephil life or death decision burritos or tacos?
[2017-05-25 02:30:51 UTC] xdaark_iv: lol
[2017-05-25 02:31:06 UTC] fabsgnecco: OMG all these bots LOL
[2017-05-25 02:32:34 UTC] deep_drive: Holy crap these bots are out of control
[2017-05-25 02:34:47 UTC] fabsgnecco: how this happened ?
[2017-05-25 02:35:34 UTC] deep_drive: This is an issue we found out today that this channel has been getting bots posting random messages
[2017-05-25 02:35:52 UTC] deep_drive: Someone is botting/viewbotting the channel
[2017-05-25 02:36:19 UTC] deep_drive: It started at 11 am today when Phil usually streams
[2017-05-25 02:36:28 UTC] deep_drive: and I guess theres more now for when Phil usually does a night stream
[2017-05-25 02:36:52 UTC] fabsgnecco: weird
[2017-05-25 02:37:03 UTC] deep_drive: I guess they're trying to frame Phil for viewbotting his channel to get it shut down
[2017-05-25 02:37:13 UTC] fabsgnecco: the messages are so random tho
[2017-05-25 02:37:15 UTC] deep_drive: but it's not gonna work
[2017-05-25 02:37:19 UTC] fabsgnecco: yes
[2017-05-25 02:37:31 UTC] deep_drive: Yeah some of the phrases are the same though
[2017-05-25 02:37:54 UTC] deep_drive: For instance a random emote and then for riot happens in a lot of them
[2017-05-25 02:38:14 UTC] fabsgnecco: yep
[2017-05-25 02:38:24 UTC] fabsgnecco: hope this get fix soon
[2017-05-25 02:38:50 UTC] deep_drive: also some of them picked up from stuff that was said earlier today in chat
[2017-05-25 02:39:29 UTC] deep_drive: Yep, unfortunately this might be an issue that twitch will have to fix
[2017-05-25 02:40:33 UTC] fabsgnecco: :/
[2017-05-25 02:42:01 UTC] deep_drive: Just looking at the chat logs it's something that has been continuously happening since the last stream ended
[2017-05-25 02:42:34 UTC] fabsgnecco: weird
[2017-05-25 02:43:33 UTC] fabsgnecco: but it's like one bot for every account ? because it's so weird that someone make one account just for one bot and we have like a bunch of then at the same time
[2017-05-25 02:43:37 UTC] fabsgnecco: you know ? lol
[2017-05-25 02:44:18 UTC] deep_drive: Well I looked up 3 of them earlier today, and those were all made in 2016
[2017-05-25 02:44:37 UTC] deep_drive: There must be a collection of thousands of accounts
[2017-05-25 02:44:54 UTC] deep_drive: Someone probably has an automated system to make lots of twitch accounts
[2017-05-25 02:45:15 UTC] deep_drive: FYI, you can make as many accounts as you want with the same email
[2017-05-25 02:46:07 UTC] deep_drive: You can't do an IP ban like in IRC but twitch can ban an ip if they detect ban evasion
[2017-05-25 02:46:42 UTC] fabsgnecco: i didn't know that
[2017-05-25 02:47:13 UTC] fabsgnecco: twitch has some flaws... this one about various accounts sharing the same email is one
[2017-05-25 02:48:02 UTC] deep_drive: Yep, although irc you have a limited amount of bans you can do in a channel...or at least on rizon which we used in the past
[2017-05-25 02:48:12 UTC] deep_drive: Though they were all ip bans
[2017-05-25 02:50:20 UTC] deep_drive: There are definitely limitations on twitch though.
[2017-05-25 02:50:35 UTC] fabsgnecco: so it's banned once for all then

[2017-05-25 02:51:40 UTC] deep_drive: perfect timing...but yeah it was once for all. We had to clear the chat every once in a while...but it was much better than this mayhem
[2017-05-25 02:52:04 UTC] deep_drive: Thought that guy was just a troll earlier in the stream but it looks like hes a bot
[2017-05-25 02:52:08 UTC] twitchy_yandeere: darksydephil when and where were you the happiest?
[2017-05-25 02:52:44 UTC] fabsgnecco: omg they are appearing every time
[2017-05-25 02:53:15 UTC] deep_drive: Yep I just sent a message on twitch to Phil that they are just continuously coming on chat
[2017-05-25 02:54:12 UTC] fabsgnecco: yes, it will be fixed soon i guess
[2017-05-25 02:58:15 UTC] fabsgnecco: i g2g now... almost 12am here
[2017-05-25 02:58:22 UTC] fabsgnecco: cya

[2017-05-25 03:05:40 UTC] deep_drive: yeah
[2017-05-25 03:05:49 UTC] deep_drive: theyy just send messages every once and awhilte tho

[2017-05-25 19:32:39 UTC] acethesly: got the original and a controller adapter lately, so much to learn though haha, I guess I should stick to one character and learn them before moving on, but all the combos and mechanics, really tricky for someone who hasn't played many fighting games

[2017-05-25 19:34:25 UTC] conky89: Destiny 2 is getting a PC port which is nice due to better controls. Though you probably will need to wait 2 years and pay an extra 100 dollars before it becomes worth playing

[2017-05-25 20:41:13 UTC] podusmonens: "First of all, Nirvana was without wit. Notice: I did not say without humor, but without wit, which requires a sharper intelligence than just jokes. “Smells Like Teen Sprit,” Nirvana’s massive hit and best known song, is a broadside against teen culture more than a satire of it. Nirvana came out of punk rock, but great punk bands like the Ramones, the Sex Pistols and even the Clash (“Rudy Can’t Fail”) not only expressed fury, depression, and alienation, but wit."

[2017-05-25 23:14:09 UTC] darthvidarviking: do you want a million dollars @mmolivee ?
[2017-05-25 23:14:20 UTC] darksydephil: thats gotta be a bot lol
[2017-05-25 23:14:23 UTC] gekkooberry: darksydephil what is it that you most dislike?
[2017-05-25 23:14:30 UTC] darksydephil: thats definitely a bot
[2017-05-25 23:14:33 UTC] darthvidarviking: yea probably
[2017-05-25 23:14:43 UTC] deep_drive: yep i've seen that message before
[2017-05-25 23:14:49 UTC] darksydephil: we'll see if twitch responds or not to my email last night
[2017-05-25 23:14:50 UTC] daemoneliphas: lmao, he gets botted and once its done they are gone, gg
[2017-05-25 23:14:58 UTC] darksydephil: but for the most part they said you can't be held accountable for it
[2017-05-25 23:15:11 UTC] darthvidarviking: a mesage on you being streeming more regulary is pretty ridiculous
[2017-05-25 23:15:15 UTC] vpzneox: heh
[2017-05-25 23:15:34 UTC] darthvidarviking: I am sure there have always been some of those lurking around
[2017-05-25 23:15:40 UTC] vpzneox: first time I see a Channel raided with Twitch "Bots", not even sure how you'd be able to do that
[2017-05-25 23:15:44 UTC] deep_drive: well the bots come in chat regardless of whether he's streaming or not
[2017-05-25 23:15:51 UTC] darthvidarviking: Because some people just say something insulting and never say anything abain
[2017-05-25 23:16:06 UTC] darthvidarviking: and it is always. You suck bad phil or something like that
[2017-05-25 23:16:56 UTC] deep_drive: lots of channels get raided and its positive...but if they just leave hateful comments then you should avoid it
[2017-05-25 23:17:07 UTC] deep_drive: today wasn't bad though
[2017-05-25 23:17:19 UTC] deep_drive: from when i was here at least
[2017-05-25 23:17:31 UTC] darthvidarviking: It would have been if we hadn't blocked them
[2017-05-25 23:19:16 UTC] deep_drive: Well, it's probably best to let them come in and if they're negative then stop them...I've seen some positive raids here
[2017-05-25 23:21:14 UTC] darthvidarviking: yeah I know what you are talking about. but that guy is like the /b/ guy on 4chat
[2017-05-25 23:21:17 UTC] darthvidarviking: chan*
[2017-05-25 23:21:35 UTC] darthvidarviking: all they do is spam the chat massively
[2017-05-25 23:23:32 UTC] xxtaze_898xx: HAM AND CHEESE
[2017-05-25 23:30:08 UTC] stampie802544: omg why is twitch on mobile so bad? the video doesn't even show after relogging twice....so counterintuitive
[2017-05-25 23:32:17 UTC] blue_blur64: there's no stream going on
[2017-05-25 23:36:25 UTC] darthvidarviking: it's a viewbot

[2017-05-25 23:48:36 UTC] darthvidarviking: It's like they are made for that purpose though.
