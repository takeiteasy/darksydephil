[2017-05-23 02:49:46 UTC] deep_drive: i mustve misread it then
[2017-05-23 02:49:48 UTC] kushiyakitori: So he was saying he hates batman for the reason that people hate Phil. It was just a ban based on misunderstanding of the sentence

[2017-05-23 03:35:24 UTC] ellietsantiara: @darksydephil well it's very cheap to live here, and some parts of Mexico are actually very pretty and clean, like Guadalajara, Xalapa, and Boca del Rio. Since they're mainly touristic cities. But I don't recommend living in Mexico City, or anywhere near the border. Those areas are dangerous

[2017-05-23 03:39:48 UTC] ellietsantiara: Well, most Mexicans will say the government sucks, and in some places it can be good or bad, depending on the local party governing each state. Since here every state has and individual political party as government.

[2017-05-23 03:40:40 UTC] ellietsantiara: @murphv I agree with you
[2017-05-23 03:40:43 UTC] murphv: @EllietSantiAra thats why Mexicans(unfortunately) prefer USA

[2017-05-23 03:42:28 UTC] ellietsantiara: Only the poorest of Mexicans decide to migrate to US illegaly, because they can't afford Visa
[2017-05-23 03:42:34 UTC] samael1981: Best game of all time Is Bloodborne IMO
[2017-05-23 03:42:40 UTC] murphv: @EllietSantiAra I dont believe that

[2017-05-23 03:43:48 UTC] kekon3: Mexico is a bad situation, and it's scary how close I've gotten with run ins, but family is still in mexico so visiting is still a thing.
[2017-05-23 03:44:04 UTC] samael1981: DSP should attempt the Bloodborne DLC again
[2017-05-23 03:44:24 UTC] murphv: @EllietSantiAra People immigrate illegally from mexico for a collection of bad situations, not just poverty
[2017-05-23 03:44:29 UTC] ellietsantiara: @kekon3 what part of Mexico does your family live in?

[2017-05-23 03:45:00 UTC] akioartorius: @Samael1981 He said he would do it if you played the whole main game for him so he would have a save file to play the dlc for blood borne
[2017-05-23 03:45:01 UTC] darthvidarviking: could mexico split in to different countries or is every mexican content with being just that ? @EllietSantiAra
[2017-05-23 03:45:05 UTC] darthvidarviking: eew @DarksydePhil
[2017-05-23 03:45:13 UTC] ellietsantiara: @murphv Yeah, mostly when they run out of options and opportunities here, they decide to go "to the other side" to see of they can have better chances
[2017-05-23 03:45:15 UTC] setronoz: Remember that time DSP masturbated on stream good times!

[2017-05-23 03:47:05 UTC] ellietsantiara: @darthvidarviking Yes, actually there's 2 states that have come very close to becoming independent nations, because of riots against the government, but no success. Even certain politicians know that if the put one step inside Oaxaca or Chiapas they will get screwed
[2017-05-23 03:47:07 UTC] doctorzzz: or clickbait Kappa
[2017-05-23 03:47:20 UTC] samael1981: Everyone should play Bloodborne at least to New game 7
[2017-05-23 03:47:23 UTC] deep_drive: audio is fine over here
[2017-05-23 03:47:36 UTC] darthvidarviking: so a military dictatorship before that happens then @EllietSantiAra ?

[2017-05-23 03:49:57 UTC] ellietsantiara: From presidency? No way, some dude tried that 30 years ago and failed, but from an independent state then yes. There are various military movements throughout history, the biggest and most powerful one is EZLN, and yes they came close to taking over the government but failed because The president in that time actually had them killed, although it still exists to this day
[2017-05-23 03:50:06 UTC] deep_drive: you forget re0 ardydaardvark ?

[2017-05-23 03:52:32 UTC] akioartorius: demo
[2017-05-23 03:52:41 UTC] ellietsantiara: Well seeing how things are going in Mexican society, it's very likely that states might start becoming independent. they have the power and rights to do so
[2017-05-23 03:53:03 UTC] akioartorius: Cyborg's eyes can't see the color blue apparently
[2017-05-23 03:53:18 UTC] akioartorius: the cyborg eye at least
[2017-05-23 03:53:43 UTC] darthvidarviking: they do?? @EllietSantiAra I have learned so much about mexico today it has almost blown my mind

[2017-05-23 03:57:04 UTC] deep_drive: Do many states want to become independent EllietSantiAra or just a few?
[2017-05-23 03:57:16 UTC] doctorzzz: try corner

[2017-05-23 03:57:40 UTC] akioartorius: yes
[2017-05-23 03:58:26 UTC] ellietsantiara: @deep_drive Mainly 2: Oaxaca and Chiapas, other states like Michoacan just run the danger of becoming independent because of the Cartel that resides there, The Knight's Templar of Michoacan

[2017-05-23 04:00:53 UTC] ellietsantiara: @darthvidarviking Well they have the firepower and people to do it, and even the citizens would stand up to it, but the Cartels don't do that because they have deals with the corrupt governments
[2017-05-23 04:01:08 UTC] easton_taylor1: @darksydephil Sideline combo is a good combo ender

[2017-05-23 04:02:33 UTC] doctorzzz: or rocket + super
[2017-05-23 04:02:33 UTC] darthvidarviking: mr.freeze @kozatof
[2017-05-23 04:02:34 UTC] kekon3: @DarksydePhil Cyborg can do a crossup 50/50 in the corner using grappling hook, doing a juggle in the corner and ending it with Light, Light, Heavy xx Grappling Hook, depending on the timing changes which side Cyborg ends up on
[2017-05-23 04:02:47 UTC] ampac92: Has dsp met low tier?

[2017-05-23 04:04:07 UTC] ellietsantiara: @darthvidarviking Actually it's becoming less of a nuisance, only certain states have a lot of problems with cartels. In the past 5 years a lot of cartel leaders have been caught or executed

[2017-05-23 04:09:38 UTC] kekon3: Is adam west batman in this game? PogChamp
[2017-05-23 04:09:55 UTC] ampac92: @kingofhypocrisy phil should go back to full time sf , I think he had more fun back then
[2017-05-23 04:09:59 UTC] samael1981: Bar fight!
[2017-05-23 04:10:14 UTC] akioartorius: sfv sucks though
[2017-05-23 04:10:27 UTC] ellietsantiara: SFV was a mistake.
[2017-05-23 04:10:32 UTC] kekon3: @ampac92 I mean, super turbo is slowing down though, it still has tournaments at the big events but...
[2017-05-23 04:10:36 UTC] kekon3: even I'm disappointed
[2017-05-23 04:10:39 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: cheer10 Which game has made you the most frustrated in your 8 years on YouTube?

[2017-05-23 04:11:45 UTC] ampac92: I think the sexual jokes he makes are pretty funny, I find phil more entertaining than toby turner by a longshot
[2017-05-23 04:11:46 UTC] kekon3: Grid vs Scarecrow is a 9-1 matchup, Grid has nothing to fear Kappa
[2017-05-23 04:11:50 UTC] ardydaardvark: plot hole in cyborg's story
[2017-05-23 04:12:34 UTC] doublej1992: So they got Englund for this game but not as Freddy in MK9
[2017-05-23 04:12:39 UTC] thefury1: does this game seem like its better than the last game?
[2017-05-23 04:12:40 UTC] ellietsantiara: Hey @darksydephil are you hyped about Far Cry 5?
[2017-05-23 04:12:54 UTC] samael1981: DSP doesn't interact with caht

[2017-05-23 04:13:24 UTC] tenryuu321: what did i miss
[2017-05-23 04:13:26 UTC] kushiyakitori: Grid sees Scarecrow in that form because his saved data from Cyborg knows that is the form he would take when the gas is present as well or some garbage like that...
[2017-05-23 04:13:27 UTC] deep_drive: hes not doing mp on this stream Kzume
[2017-05-23 04:13:32 UTC] kushiyakitori: @Kzume for today. more later
[2017-05-23 04:13:36 UTC] kzume: iiight
[2017-05-23 04:13:38 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: @Kekon3 :( I guess I just won't cheer anymore
[2017-05-23 04:13:41 UTC] darthvidarviking: @KushiYakitori that makes sense
[2017-05-23 04:13:54 UTC] ampac92: @kingofhypocrisy you have to cheer 100 bits or more for him to respond
[2017-05-23 04:13:59 UTC] kekon3: But Hypocrisy, think of the children
[2017-05-23 04:14:01 UTC] ellietsantiara: @kingofhypocrisy I think he thinks you're a detractor/troll
[2017-05-23 04:14:06 UTC] blackscottpilgrim: Lmfao wow dood
[2017-05-23 04:14:07 UTC] deep_drive: nah he usually responds for any cheer amount
[2017-05-23 04:14:10 UTC] kekon3: They only smile when you cheer for them
[2017-05-23 04:14:22 UTC] kushiyakitori: @darthvidarviking thats the only thing I can' think of that would work since Grid has Cyborgs knowledge and doesn't need the actual fear gas to know the appearance
[2017-05-23 04:14:35 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: @ampac92 Where does it say that?
[2017-05-23 04:14:38 UTC] ampac92: @deep_drive he changed that yesterday to prevent trolls from cheering
[2017-05-23 04:15:04 UTC] ampac92: @kingofhypocrisy phil said that in yesterday pre stream

[2017-05-23 04:15:27 UTC] tippps: wtf
[2017-05-23 04:15:27 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: @EllietSantiAra He probably does but I was asking honest question. Not offensive
[2017-05-23 04:15:32 UTC] tippps: you win by default
[2017-05-23 04:15:43 UTC] kekon3: I'd use that outfit, if I knew how to unlock it

[2017-05-23 04:15:48 UTC] doublej1992: Do you think game developers when making these games make Harley nude
[2017-05-23 04:15:52 UTC] kekon3: thats a spaced out harley skin
[2017-05-23 04:16:05 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: @ampac92 Oh I missed that one, pretty lame

[2017-05-23 04:16:18 UTC] kekon3: You start out nude, Koz
[2017-05-23 04:16:25 UTC] kekon3: You ever think about that?
[2017-05-23 04:16:29 UTC] kozatof: Hell Yeah bruv

[2017-05-23 04:17:20 UTC] kekon3: don't lie to me

[2017-05-23 04:17:48 UTC] ardydaardvark: @kushiyakitori thaaaaat's a real stretch. since scarecrow's gas affects organic brain functions, and grid is üíØ% android, then he MUST see only the real doctor's form, and nothing else.
[2017-05-23 04:17:49 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: @ampac92 No idea d00d
[2017-05-23 04:17:50 UTC] akioartorius: Leanna is at her office?
[2017-05-23 04:18:08 UTC] supers18: why no multiplayer/
[2017-05-23 04:18:14 UTC] ellietsantiara: Does Grid bleed?

[2017-05-23 04:18:33 UTC] doublej1992: Grid sees normal scarecrow. This isn't first person we are spectators
[2017-05-23 04:18:34 UTC] spyda100: @EllietSantiAra Yes. Motor Oil. Kappa
[2017-05-23 04:18:36 UTC] philtheboss2367: @hiimreverie cool
[2017-05-23 04:18:44 UTC] kekon3: Hiim, why are you avoiding my nude questions, are you ashamed?
[2017-05-23 04:18:52 UTC] kushiyakitori: @ardydaardvark I mean the only thing that would explain it is a stretch. I'm just making up an excuse. I don't think they actually considered. Closest excuse is grid choosing to view Scarecrow in the other form because of the variables present. I don't think NRS thought it through
[2017-05-23 04:18:56 UTC] darthvidarviking: only brain remain
[2017-05-23 04:18:57 UTC] talhead: @hiimreverie bro then leave no one is forcing you to be here

[2017-05-23 04:22:24 UTC] kozatof: No, far cry is shit
[2017-05-23 04:22:24 UTC] drilbit777: Knowing Harada he'd probably add an idolmaster character to tekken 7 Kappa

[2017-05-23 19:16:39 UTC] cherry_dood: He looked. It's not that big of a deal. But the line in the sand is way too defined. He either looked at the chat and is a piece of shit for it or he didn't look at the chat and you're an idiot if you think he did.
[2017-05-23 19:16:51 UTC] yaslothy: idk but that playthrough wasn't great anyways

[2017-05-23 19:17:27 UTC] yaslothy: he might play crash 3
[2017-05-23 19:17:30 UTC] deep_drive: It was great yacherdy...greatness being defined by stream attendance that is
[2017-05-23 19:17:41 UTC] yaslothy: well sure deep
[2017-05-23 19:17:56 UTC] cherry_dood: when is the Twitch and Chill?

[2017-05-23 19:19:14 UTC] yaslothy: I'll be gone on the weekend...in fact I probably will take another break from chat until Monday. That's why I wanted to come in here and talk to you guys for a bit.
