[2017-05-09 00:09:51 UTC] boxman222: CEO of lavaria is on sokast now... so if you want to know the truth, then tune in ;)
[2017-05-09 00:15:39 UTC] ownager99: 5 minutes in and the CEO already said he didn't want to work with DSP
[2017-05-09 00:15:42 UTC] boxman222: so the ceo of laveria now revealed that phil lied.. it was they who decided to drop him based on a background check
[2017-05-09 00:16:11 UTC] boxman222: but i guess the current ceo is a detractor and liar as well
[2017-05-09 00:17:55 UTC] ownager99: Hahaha oh man Phil BTFO
[2017-05-09 00:28:17 UTC] sanguinenite: lol okay, then please do tell, what DID the CEO of lavaria say is the real reason they decided to drop him? Background check? what kind of a background check and what did they fine, hm?
[2017-05-09 00:29:10 UTC] xanthis42: Have you tried Googling him, @sanguinenite ?
[2017-05-09 00:31:52 UTC] ownager99: Listen to the SoK stream the CEO is on right now explaining it
[2017-05-09 00:31:58 UTC] boxman222: Sanguinenite: even him uploading raw gameplay without any effort of editing out copyrighted music could be enough for a network to drop him
[2017-05-09 00:32:02 UTC] xanthis42: Not to say that's what they did, it's just... you can google anyone.
[2017-05-09 00:32:24 UTC] boxman222: on top of that he now just said that his channel is not even legit to begin with considering he was banned from adsense years ago
[2017-05-09 00:32:42 UTC] boxman222: so if youtube knew that he uses a separate adsense account now, then his channel could be banned completely
[2017-05-09 00:33:01 UTC] boxman222: he has dug himself a deep hole this time...
[2017-05-09 00:41:20 UTC] nin10dont: RIP EleGiggle
[2017-05-09 00:41:23 UTC] sanguinenite: If that is the case, Twitch would not have paid Phil for March. So unless Phil comes out and say Twitch refuses to pay him because of his disabled adsense, SoK's claims are all unproven or verified.
[2017-05-09 00:42:24 UTC] xanthis42: AdSense is tied to Youtube, not Twitch. At least from what I can see
[2017-05-09 00:44:10 UTC] sanguinenite: And even let just say Laveria dicked phil, so what? Twitch has already told Phil that even if things dont work out, they will happily accept Phil back on Twitch, this is what Phil said word for word so what relevance does Laveria "honeydicking" phil worked out or not?
[2017-05-09 00:45:15 UTC] boxman222: what the fuck does twitch have to do with this?? it is a seprate entity that has nothing to do with adsense, youtube/google
[2017-05-09 00:45:30 UTC] boxman222: this is about his youtube channel and nothing else
[2017-05-09 00:45:33 UTC] boxman222: channels*
[2017-05-09 00:45:43 UTC] xanthis42: Well, if that's true then he's now without an MCN and no longer has any sort of protection against content ID claims on Youtube. Twitch is another matter entirely.
[2017-05-09 00:46:36 UTC] sanguinenite: What happened after Machinema's contract with Phil ended? Wasnt phil on his own, at least with regard to Youtube?
[2017-05-09 00:46:49 UTC] boxman222: it is same as when he was with curse as he did not have managed partnership there iether
[2017-05-09 00:47:26 UTC] boxman222: but things could change for the worse if youtube finds out or take action regarding him using a second adsense account
[2017-05-09 00:47:43 UTC] xanthis42: @sanguinenite Whenever he has been without a partnership he's been hit with content ID claims.
[2017-05-09 00:48:21 UTC] sanguinenite: Read my question again - I asked with regards to him income on Youtube, after his machinema contract ended, Phil was still earning shit on youtube. So clearly, you DONT have to be part of an MCN, managed or not. Yeah, but those ID claims are on OLD videos, so they hardly affect his monthly revenue stream. 90% of his views are from NEW content.
[2017-05-09 00:49:38 UTC] sanguinenite: Being a managed partner is just extra insurance but I do not think Phil will die just yet, not while Twitch is his other support.
[2017-05-09 00:49:46 UTC] boxman222: most of his revenue per month is from old videos though
[2017-05-09 00:51:23 UTC] sanguinenite: Well, considering he has over 40K videos on his channel, I cannot say I am surprised. But just as how the sheer number of videos work out, the content ID claims are but a fraction of his uploaded content, so the impact is evened out.
[2017-05-09 00:52:14 UTC] ownager99: Damn Laveria is destroying goutboy. How will Phil recover?
[2017-05-09 00:54:03 UTC] xanthis42: Just about every claim he's made about them has been denied by them
[2017-05-09 00:54:04 UTC] boxman222: i think the real interesting part is that the CEO confirmed that youtube does not allow a second adsense account and that his current channel is actually in violation of youtube terms now if he is using a separate one
[2017-05-09 00:54:34 UTC] boxman222: so his whole channel is really in risk of being banned in future
[2017-05-09 00:54:35 UTC] sanguinenite: Technically untrue. I myself did the same thing and as of now, I only have ONE adsense account
[2017-05-09 00:55:08 UTC] boxman222: problem is that phil got his adsense account banned by youtube years ago
[2017-05-09 00:55:26 UTC] sanguinenite: But it was on a false accusation of click fraud
[2017-05-09 00:55:27 UTC] boxman222: so he must have used some kind of workaround to get a new one.. maybe using leanna's details
[2017-05-09 00:55:40 UTC] boxman222: it is still banned.. and it is not false
[2017-05-09 00:55:50 UTC] xanthis42: A ban is a ban, @sanguinenite . They'll see a ban evasion and crack down even harder
[2017-05-09 00:55:59 UTC] boxman222: the evidence is out there
[2017-05-09 00:56:09 UTC] sanguinenite: I too got one of my youtube channels banned from monetisation. and I am pretty sure I didnt ask anyone to click my ads
[2017-05-09 00:56:17 UTC] xanthis42: If he had appealed and gotten it turned over it would've been a different story.
[2017-05-09 00:56:34 UTC] sanguinenite: How can you over turn a claim when Google Adsense is all automated?
[2017-05-09 00:56:51 UTC] boxman222: and he revealed just a month ago or so that it is still banned
[2017-05-09 00:56:58 UTC] boxman222: so doubt anything is different now
[2017-05-09 00:57:22 UTC] xanthis42: I dunno, how did you get your channel unbanned?
[2017-05-09 00:57:56 UTC] sanguinenite: He is banned was over 7 years ago and ever since he worked with Machinema until their contract ended. So that 7 year ago banned channel adsense is expired
[2017-05-09 00:58:05 UTC] sanguinenite: *His ban
[2017-05-09 00:58:27 UTC] boxman222: it never expires...
[2017-05-09 00:58:37 UTC] sanguinenite: If it never expires, then please
[2017-05-09 00:58:49 UTC] sanguinenite: explain how on earth Machinema paid him for so long
[2017-05-09 00:58:57 UTC] boxman222: when he joined machinima there was no need for any adsense
[2017-05-09 00:59:05 UTC] boxman222: that was in fact one of the reasons he was with a MCN
[2017-05-09 00:59:06 UTC] ownager99: They also said it was up to Googles discretion. If enough people show them the video threatening Youtube I'm sure he would get canned. It's not like he gets a lot of views
[2017-05-09 00:59:23 UTC] boxman222: as it was a workaround that would enable him to earn ad revenue even without adsense
[2017-05-09 00:59:36 UTC] boxman222: but now things have changed drastically in last weeks
[2017-05-09 01:00:36 UTC] sanguinenite: Well, why dont we all see how it works? If Phil still doesnt say anything about him being disabled in terms of revenue on Youtube, we will hear about it. No need for you detractors to stalk him like this.
[2017-05-09 01:01:00 UTC] sanguinenite: I know you all want Phil to get a "real job"
[2017-05-09 01:01:07 UTC] honeydiked: No one stalks him, mate.
[2017-05-09 01:01:11 UTC] boxman222: he already talked about it in the past.. the reason he is able to make ad revenue now is because he must have made a separate adsense account most likely with different information
[2017-05-09 01:01:13 UTC] sanguinenite: lol really?
[2017-05-09 01:01:17 UTC] boxman222: which is against the rules
[2017-05-09 01:01:21 UTC] sanguinenite: your username tells me otherwise
[2017-05-09 01:01:28 UTC] xanthis42: Is it stalking when he puts everything out in the open?
[2017-05-09 01:01:46 UTC] honeydiked: My name, a reference to The Interview, shows that looking at basic research and/or what Phil himself says, is stalking
[2017-05-09 01:01:50 UTC] sanguinenite: uh yes, you dont see me talking about phil talking, ever
[2017-05-09 01:01:53 UTC] xanthis42: That's like saying you're stalking Trump's twitter
[2017-05-09 01:02:02 UTC] littlefootman: Well, he does upload his entire life to the internet...
[2017-05-09 01:02:24 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeah it would make sense if Phil was some big shot politician but no, you guys stalk an ordinary guy
[2017-05-09 01:02:54 UTC] honeydiked: No, it's literally impossible to stalk someone who forces all the information into your face.
[2017-05-09 01:03:00 UTC] littlefootman: im not a detractor i just found DSP like a few weeks ago
[2017-05-09 01:03:23 UTC] boxman222: large percentage of us have actually been viewers or even fans/subs of him
[2017-05-09 01:03:25 UTC] sanguinenite: Who is forcing it in your face? If you dislike Phil, dont watch his videos, plain and simple
[2017-05-09 01:03:34 UTC] newbornkingz: You can't stalk someone who puts all their information out for the entire public to see. Especially when you upload 500 videos in one month on one channel
[2017-05-09 01:03:51 UTC] sanguinenite: You forced your hand to click any of those 500 videos a month?
[2017-05-09 01:03:51 UTC] boxman222: when i got enough of phil all i wanted was for him to change
[2017-05-09 01:03:58 UTC] littlefootman: Newborn makes a cogent point...
[2017-05-09 01:04:05 UTC] boxman222: now i am here just because the trainwreck is entertaining to watch
[2017-05-09 01:04:07 UTC] xanthis42: @sanguinenite You don't need to stalk what's being put out there for all to see. There's full videos of his staycation, plenty of pre-streams and weekly updates, a ton of information slung out on twitter and twitch.
[2017-05-09 01:04:20 UTC] boxman222: i still want him to change, but i do not have nay hopes of that now
[2017-05-09 01:04:32 UTC] sanguinenite: LUL You didnt have to click on any of them to know of what he did You guys ARE stalkers.
[2017-05-09 01:04:45 UTC] newbornkingz: And you're a delusional fanboy
[2017-05-09 01:04:47 UTC] sanguinenite: I hope you guys have some self-realisation
[2017-05-09 01:04:52 UTC] sanguinenite: and get some medical help
[2017-05-09 01:04:54 UTC] xanthis42: So we shouldn't watch his videos? What do you do?
[2017-05-09 01:04:58 UTC] boxman222: you are just like phil..
[2017-05-09 01:05:02 UTC] boxman222: like a parrot
[2017-05-09 01:05:10 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I am my own person
[2017-05-09 01:05:10 UTC] xanthis42: Do you watch his streams and Youtube vids?
[2017-05-09 01:05:13 UTC] newbornkingz: You don't have to click on his video's when his title is basically telling you mostly everything
[2017-05-09 01:05:15 UTC] littlefootman: okay this is just retarded, nobody needs mental help who criticises phil
[2017-05-09 01:05:26 UTC] boxman222: then maybe stop parroting him and think for yourself??
[2017-05-09 01:05:40 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I think you guys hate phil because you guys secretly envy how he can just say whatever he wants to say
[2017-05-09 01:05:50 UTC] boxman222: i have seen for myself what kind of person phil is and that was before watching any of his hater videos
[2017-05-09 01:05:52 UTC] littlefootman: what...
[2017-05-09 01:06:03 UTC] xanthis42: @sanguinenite Do you watch Phil on here or Youtube?
[2017-05-09 01:06:08 UTC] newbornkingz: Obviously he can't say whatever he want to say he got fired twice within a few month span
[2017-05-09 01:06:09 UTC] sanguinenite: He managed to do what most of you cannot.
[2017-05-09 01:06:17 UTC] littlefootman: see man, this is why i dont like DSP fans. ugh
[2017-05-09 01:06:28 UTC] newbornkingz: Lmaoo this fanboy is delusional as fuck
[2017-05-09 01:06:34 UTC] sanguinenite: You guys, lacking any kind of a real future of your own, decide to spend the rest of your life speculating about someone else's future
[2017-05-09 01:06:38 UTC] sanguinenite: because you dont have one
[2017-05-09 01:06:43 UTC] boxman222: i just watched his stream as a regular viewer and saw the way he treated his fans.. one time even banned a long time viewer and i believe a sub for saying that he disagreed with phil about kingdom hearts 2
[2017-05-09 01:06:46 UTC] littlefootman: dude hes fucking in debt up to his goatee my life is far fucking better than his lol. fuck YouTube
[2017-05-09 01:06:48 UTC] xanthis42: Still waiting on that answer, bud.
[2017-05-09 01:06:49 UTC] boxman222: and that he actually personally thought it was a good game
[2017-05-09 01:06:55 UTC] boxman222: phil himself banned him
[2017-05-09 01:07:13 UTC] newbornkingz: What future? You mean the declining future? The all unpaid debts?
[2017-05-09 01:07:24 UTC] boxman222: it was not until that point i started looking into so called hater videos
[2017-05-09 01:07:32 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I am just here to get information from the trolls and hear what they have to say, so far, it is all circumstantial. And about the debt... he can always sell his condo in Conneticut
[2017-05-09 01:07:40 UTC] littlefootman: dude we lack a future? ive got an interview for a city job that could set me up for fucking life in 2 weeks. DSP is fucked. whos life is better lmao
[2017-05-09 01:07:59 UTC] dassmun: Oh, we're finally mentioning that the SoK pretty much stalked people's personal accounts? I mean, I sorta like the SoK, but that was honestly unnecessary. Especially with the chat now wanting Nicole on every stream.
[2017-05-09 01:08:02 UTC] newbornkingz: He can always sell his condo in Connecticut yet he has mentioned for many videos that he can't sell his condo
[2017-05-09 01:08:03 UTC] sanguinenite: not to mention, twitch. LOL that interview is worth shit unless you actually get a job and stay in it
[2017-05-09 01:08:13 UTC] xanthis42: @sanguinenite Just a yes or no, do you watch him on Youtube and Twitch?
[2017-05-09 01:08:20 UTC] littlefootman: i have 30k in liquid assets to my name and do work currently *** lmao
[2017-05-09 01:08:23 UTC] sanguinenite: It is more like he doesnt want to sell his condo
[2017-05-09 01:08:28 UTC] sanguinenite: because it will incur a loss
[2017-05-09 01:08:30 UTC] boxman222: and how am i wasting my life more than a fan like yourself?? i still enjoy following this guy as he provides alot of entertainment
[2017-05-09 01:08:44 UTC] sanguinenite: If times were really that bad, he will sell his condo
[2017-05-09 01:08:45 UTC] littlefootman: like youre weak ass logic is astounding. im out this was funny.
[2017-05-09 01:08:59 UTC] sanguinenite: Talking to you losers was funny for me too
[2017-05-09 01:09:02 UTC] newbornkingz: Times must be bad if he constantly has to beg every pre-stream for people to donate
[2017-05-09 01:09:18 UTC] newbornkingz: So what you're saying is he has been lying about how bad his situation is
[2017-05-09 01:09:18 UTC] sanguinenite: Why does it even matter if I watch his videos here on just on Twitch?
[2017-05-09 01:09:25 UTC] littlefootman: im a loser lol for laughing at idiots on the internet. kay, fam
[2017-05-09 01:09:28 UTC] littlefootman: enjoy your life
[2017-05-09 01:09:36 UTC] xanthis42: And point out his Patreon, and his fiance's Etsy shop, and his teespring store.
[2017-05-09 01:09:37 UTC] sanguinenite: The PJSalt makes me smile
[2017-05-09 01:09:52 UTC] xanthis42: @sanguinenite Because if you watch him, you likely know as much as we do
[2017-05-09 01:09:56 UTC] newbornkingz: That quality khantent dood
[2017-05-09 01:10:02 UTC] xanthis42: He shows everything.
[2017-05-09 01:10:25 UTC] sanguinenite: That is why I like making trolls angry with my logic. Because it tells me 1. My logic is superior 2. You guys lives suck that you need to stalk someone you dont even like
[2017-05-09 01:10:29 UTC] xanthis42: From his monetary issues to partnerships to failing at crouch-jumping in Black Mesa.
[2017-05-09 01:10:30 UTC] newbornkingz: Quick I must protect my man-child while he is having his lay-around time with his daughter
[2017-05-09 01:10:49 UTC] sanguinenite: lol So what if he shows everything?
[2017-05-09 01:11:04 UTC] sanguinenite: Is that a problem for you that you dont have the courage to do the same?
[2017-05-09 01:11:11 UTC] xanthis42: If he shows everything it's hardly stalking him if we know more about him.
[2017-05-09 01:11:19 UTC] newbornkingz: Courage LOL
[2017-05-09 01:11:25 UTC] boxman222: he is saying you do not have to watch "hater" videos or listen to them to see what kind of person he is
[2017-05-09 01:11:28 UTC] sanguinenite: No, you can choose NOT to watch the videos, so yes, you guys are stalker
[2017-05-09 01:11:37 UTC] xanthis42: Courage. Was it courage that led him to masturbate on a pre-stream?
[2017-05-09 01:11:41 UTC] sanguinenite: Who forced you at gun point to watch DSP's videos?
[2017-05-09 01:11:42 UTC] boxman222: you will know everything just from watching him on a semi regular baiss
[2017-05-09 01:11:44 UTC] newbornkingz: You DONT have to watch his videos
[2017-05-09 01:11:55 UTC] newbornkingz: The title explains it
[2017-05-09 01:12:19 UTC] xanthis42: Sanguinenite, how old are you?
[2017-05-09 01:12:20 UTC] sanguinenite: Title, what title are you talkiing about?
[2017-05-09 01:12:34 UTC] sanguinenite: LOL 159
[2017-05-09 01:12:38 UTC] newbornkingz: The title on every one of his youtube videos
[2017-05-09 01:12:59 UTC] sanguinenite: What's wrong with the titles, you wouldnt have seen them unless you followd his channel
[2017-05-09 01:13:03 UTC] ownager99: The CEO of Laveria is watching videos of Phil begging this is hilarious
[2017-05-09 01:13:22 UTC] xanthis42: Or you could just go to his page or search for him...
[2017-05-09 01:13:28 UTC] sanguinenite: Begging? All other bigger Twitch uses do the same so you guys are hypocrites for calling Phil out.
[2017-05-09 01:13:29 UTC] newbornkingz: Don't have to follow his channel his channel will eventually pop up in search results
[2017-05-09 01:13:33 UTC] xanthis42: God, it's almost like we live in the information age.
[2017-05-09 01:13:45 UTC] xanthis42: @sanguinenite Nobody begs as much as he does
[2017-05-09 01:14:08 UTC] sanguinenite: And even if he does beg more than others, so fucking what? I am not affected by it.
[2017-05-09 01:14:10 UTC] xanthis42: You can name anyone you want and I will bet money they don't beg as hard as he does.
[2017-05-09 01:14:31 UTC] newbornkingz: This must be sammy samosa
[2017-05-09 01:14:31 UTC] ownager99: @sanguinenite You're delusional Phil is the biggest beggar I've ever seen. He's sitting on the corner with that black shirt holding a cup
[2017-05-09 01:14:33 UTC] sanguinenite: Of course, they dont have to since they have twitch's backing
[2017-05-09 01:14:53 UTC] ownager99: Literally getting change in donations
[2017-05-09 01:14:58 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I am not affected by it, dont tell me you losers actually donated and then turn coat on phil?
[2017-05-09 01:15:05 UTC] xanthis42: So Phil should get his ass into a Twitch partnership.
[2017-05-09 01:15:09 UTC] newbornkingz: I don't donate to anyone
[2017-05-09 01:15:13 UTC] sanguinenite: me too
[2017-05-09 01:15:14 UTC] xanthis42: And no, I've never donated.
[2017-05-09 01:15:16 UTC] ownager99: I've donated 20 cents to his sorry ass
[2017-05-09 01:15:17 UTC] xanthis42: To anyone.
[2017-05-09 01:15:29 UTC] boxman222: sanguinenite: i honestly do not give a shit about his begging itself. The problem is that he talked shit about other streamers and youtubers for doing the same and now he has sold out more than any of them
[2017-05-09 01:15:38 UTC] sanguinenite: They have
[2017-05-09 01:15:38 UTC] ownager99: He didn't even read my donation but everyone started talking about SoK after I donated so worth it
[2017-05-09 01:15:39 UTC] newbornkingz: ^
[2017-05-09 01:16:01 UTC] sanguinenite: Phil is more real than all other gaming youtubers
[2017-05-09 01:16:05 UTC] sanguinenite: that is a true statement
[2017-05-09 01:16:10 UTC] newbornkingz: More real LOL
[2017-05-09 01:16:20 UTC] newbornkingz: Nice bait m8
[2017-05-09 01:16:31 UTC] sanguinenite: yes, you have a problem with that statement?
[2017-05-09 01:16:32 UTC] xanthis42: And where has that gotten him?
[2017-05-09 01:16:34 UTC] newbornkingz: Lol im done here
[2017-05-09 01:16:42 UTC] sanguinenite: It got him a lot of hate
[2017-05-09 01:16:43 UTC] boxman222: lol.. you have to be trolling us
[2017-05-09 01:17:01 UTC] sanguinenite: being truthful in this world will bring out the demons in you ppl
[2017-05-09 01:17:19 UTC] xanthis42: From what I can tell he's gotten content IDs, lost subscribers on a monthly basis, stagnated on Patreon and Youtube, and now lost his third MCN.
[2017-05-09 01:17:22 UTC] sanguinenite: Which is why I can empathize with him
[2017-05-09 01:17:34 UTC] sanguinenite: But he is still here...
[2017-05-09 01:18:06 UTC] xanthis42: Yes, yes he is. I'll give him that, he clings to this when most people would have given up.
[2017-05-09 01:18:14 UTC] sanguinenite: In my life, many people dont like my guts, just like phil, so I know what he is going thru. He will survive even despite all the trolling attempts that you guys try to do
[2017-05-09 01:18:29 UTC] ownager99: He is a cockroach so probably
[2017-05-09 01:18:37 UTC] xanthis42: So a hypothetical here, what if he does go down?
[2017-05-09 01:18:47 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeah, we are fighters instead of cowards like you guys are :)
[2017-05-09 01:18:57 UTC] xanthis42: Again, how old are you?
[2017-05-09 01:18:58 UTC] sanguinenite: Call us cockroach or anything else, we are still here...
[2017-05-09 01:18:58 UTC] ownager99: He'll probably still stream and beg for money even if he's living in his car
[2017-05-09 01:19:06 UTC] sanguinenite: 159
[2017-05-09 01:19:14 UTC] xanthis42: 15, got it.
[2017-05-09 01:19:17 UTC] ownager99: Sanguinenite is really young I suggest you google him lotta good finds
[2017-05-09 01:19:29 UTC] sanguinenite: So what? Asking of tips is fine
[2017-05-09 01:19:34 UTC] ownager99: If he's 15 he has a very low IQ
[2017-05-09 01:19:45 UTC] sanguinenite: It is you detractors that have a problem with it since you guys cannot stand Phil
[2017-05-09 01:20:01 UTC] sanguinenite: lolol sure your IQ is negative so I am better than you guys
[2017-05-09 01:20:09 UTC] xanthis42: Let me put it this way. Maximilian Dood had over 10k in tips on his birthday without a single word of tips on his end.
[2017-05-09 01:20:19 UTC] sanguinenite: Only a retard would stalk phil when you said you hate him.
[2017-05-09 01:20:26 UTC] ownager99: Well most people think begging for money is pretty unpleasent to watch
[2017-05-09 01:20:33 UTC] xanthis42: Cryaotic had over $300 because of a silly thing someone started
[2017-05-09 01:20:48 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Maximilian Dood also isn't a ginormous asshole and constantly uses his donations to improve his stremaing setup
[2017-05-09 01:20:49 UTC] davidn64: glad that sanguin is putting precious time talking shit about detractors Kappa
[2017-05-09 01:20:51 UTC] xanthis42: BroTeam has had similar events. Again, none of these people beg. Ever.
[2017-05-09 01:20:54 UTC] sanguinenite: I heard of this "Maximillion" guy before but I really dont care about who and what he does, he might as well not exist to me
[2017-05-09 01:21:15 UTC] sanguinenite: I like getting into chats like this because I think it will help you mental retards get help :)
[2017-05-09 01:21:29 UTC] sanguinenite: I am trying to talk some sense into you trolls
[2017-05-09 01:21:57 UTC] sanguinenite: I hope one day you guys get out of your horrible life. If you guys didnt have a sucky life, you wouldnt be stalking someone you claim to hate
[2017-05-09 01:21:59 UTC] xanthis42: Max is a pillar of the fighting game community and is one of the biggest Killer Instinct buffs in existence. He's a regular at tournaments and an all-around good dude.
[2017-05-09 01:22:20 UTC] sanguinenite: So basically, Max is Mr nice guy
[2017-05-09 01:22:30 UTC] xanthis42: Max is hype.
[2017-05-09 01:22:39 UTC] sanguinenite: There are alot of scammers who are act nice too just to get money
[2017-05-09 01:22:51 UTC] sanguinenite: You guys clearly havent seen real life yet
[2017-05-09 01:23:00 UTC] ownager99: The CEO of Laveria is laughing at Phils videos right now
[2017-05-09 01:23:09 UTC] ownager99: This is great
[2017-05-09 01:23:20 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Laveria CEO = new SoK member
[2017-05-09 01:23:24 UTC] sanguinenite: I dont really care, he can do what he wants, doesnt change the fact that Phil is still here.
[2017-05-09 01:23:43 UTC] xanthis42: See, here's the thing. Max has made a living and not had a single issue with money on his good mood.
[2017-05-09 01:23:44 UTC] boxman222: "why does he say everything is broken?? he is..... just a bit special"
[2017-05-09 01:23:45 UTC] sanguinenite: SoK can go make a parade every new hater they get, I really dont give a shit. And neither should you, unless your life sucks
[2017-05-09 01:23:45 UTC] boxman222: hahaha
[2017-05-09 01:23:55 UTC] ufccurbstomp: SAVAGE
[2017-05-09 01:24:09 UTC] ownager99: They have quite a bit more haters than DSP has fans
[2017-05-09 01:24:14 UTC] sanguinenite: Of course
[2017-05-09 01:24:26 UTC] ownager99: Has DSP EVER got 1.6k viewers on a stream?
[2017-05-09 01:24:27 UTC] ufccurbstomp: It's not quite a bit more, it's WAY more
[2017-05-09 01:24:33 UTC] ownager99: 1.4*
[2017-05-09 01:24:39 UTC] sanguinenite: Being honest like Phil will bring out the trolls in people, so of course, haters are going to exceed supporters
[2017-05-09 01:24:42 UTC] ufccurbstomp: DSP can't get 1.6 even when he streams a Souls game
[2017-05-09 01:24:55 UTC] ownager99: BEING HONEST LIKE PHIL
[2017-05-09 01:24:55 UTC] xanthis42: Has DSP even passed 1k?
[2017-05-09 01:24:55 UTC] sanguinenite: Of course, he didnt sell out
[2017-05-09 01:24:58 UTC] ownager99: YOU REALLY JUST SAID THAT
[2017-05-09 01:24:58 UTC] nightbot: ownager99 -> I'm gonna RENOVATE your ass! (Please don't spam caps) [warning]
[2017-05-09 01:25:07 UTC] xanthis42: How often does he pass 500?
[2017-05-09 01:25:12 UTC] ownager99: You really just said "honest like Phil"
[2017-05-09 01:25:18 UTC] ownager99: That's the funniest bit yet
[2017-05-09 01:25:22 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Day 1 new game - MAYBE he passes 500
[2017-05-09 01:25:35 UTC] xanthis42: There's mountains of evidence that Phil's dishonest, dude.
[2017-05-09 01:25:38 UTC] sanguinenite: Yes, all the so-called lies you detractors point out are all circumstantial
[2017-05-09 01:25:51 UTC] sanguinenite: Do you guys know what the word "circumstantial" means?
[2017-05-09 01:25:55 UTC] ownager99: Haha oh man you're pretty delusional
[2017-05-09 01:25:59 UTC] xanthis42: Contradictory statements on an almost weekly basis.
[2017-05-09 01:26:09 UTC] sanguinenite: Say whatever you want - I still want to help you mentally ill people
[2017-05-09 01:26:11 UTC] sanguinenite: I really do
[2017-05-09 01:27:37 UTC] xanthis42: My guess is you're still in high school. You prefer wearing darker clothes, preferably jeans to shorts. You've never spoken back to your parents to their face but constantly talk shit behind their back. If you had to pick a favorite color it would be red.
[2017-05-09 01:27:46 UTC] ownager99: "Mentally ill" you sound like a mini-Phil
[2017-05-09 01:28:52 UTC] sanguinenite: I feel bad for you guys, you guys are probably from a broken family with mummy and daddy fighting and you never got a job doing what you love. Your life sucks.... and now you are talking it out on phil, a guy who managed to make it work despite the odds against him
[2017-05-09 01:29:12 UTC] xanthis42: What you're telling me now is I've hit it right on the money.
[2017-05-09 01:29:18 UTC] xanthis42: Enjoy your first job.
[2017-05-09 01:29:58 UTC] sanguinenite: I really feel bad for you guys, for real. And no, I never talk behind people's back, only cowards like you do, like the SoK and you detractors have to make gossip
[2017-05-09 01:30:00 UTC] sanguinenite: I hate gossip
[2017-05-09 01:30:11 UTC] sanguinenite: so lol you are wrong about me
[2017-05-09 01:30:19 UTC] ownager99: I'm coolguy6669 the guy that made most of the chat agree with me and made you look really stupid. So I'm sure you know about my job already
[2017-05-09 01:30:55 UTC] sanguinenite: lol no I dont, your job? lol did you even tell me? :)
[2017-05-09 01:31:28 UTC] ownager99: Maybe you have a bad memory. I told you and the 2 others that were against me and they stopped talking real quick
[2017-05-09 01:31:38 UTC] sanguinenite: You guys are all losers, that you would follow Phil, a guy who you claim to hate. But you lack the self control from watching his videos for some weird reason
[2017-05-09 01:32:03 UTC] ownager99: The most triggered I've ever seen you get is when I just ignored you so I'm just gonna do that again
[2017-05-09 01:32:10 UTC] boxman222: i dont have any hate for him at all
[2017-05-09 01:32:18 UTC] boxman222: as i said i find the trainwreck ENTERTAINING
[2017-05-09 01:32:26 UTC] boxman222: which is exactly same reason you are watching him
[2017-05-09 01:32:32 UTC] sanguinenite: yes you do. It is entertaining because it makes you feel better about yourself
[2017-05-09 01:32:37 UTC] xanthis42: Hate's an odd word. I'm with boxman on it, watching a slow-motion explosion
[2017-05-09 01:32:41 UTC] boxman222: not at all
[2017-05-09 01:32:48 UTC] sanguinenite: No I watch him because I like him as a person thats all
[2017-05-09 01:32:54 UTC] boxman222: i just find it fascinating how he can act like this
[2017-05-09 01:33:00 UTC] boxman222: and that gives me entertainment
[2017-05-09 01:33:08 UTC] boxman222: i just want to see how it will end
[2017-05-09 01:33:12 UTC] xanthis42: Hey Box, remember when Phil couldn't spin kick on Jak and Daxter till over two hours in?
[2017-05-09 01:33:25 UTC] sanguinenite: So coolguy what is your job? You have a job at Amazon? As a janitor?
[2017-05-09 01:33:33 UTC] xanthis42: Or how he forgot how to use rations on MGS?
[2017-05-09 01:33:50 UTC] sanguinenite: I didnt watch MGS but I heard troll talk about it before
[2017-05-09 01:34:16 UTC] xanthis42: It was... god, took like twenty or thirty minutes and he had to look it up.
[2017-05-09 01:34:38 UTC] sanguinenite: look what up?
[2017-05-09 01:34:48 UTC] xanthis42: How to use rations.
[2017-05-09 01:35:00 UTC] boxman222: i remember when he played GTA with a timer running down on the screen and him complaining and calling game broken when it failed because he ran out of time as there was no timer showing on the screen
[2017-05-09 01:35:03 UTC] sanguinenite: he admits to suck at games, so what
[2017-05-09 01:35:07 UTC] sanguinenite: if he sucks
[2017-05-09 01:35:12 UTC] boxman222: even when he redid the mission with timer being obviously there he was in denial
[2017-05-09 01:35:32 UTC] sanguinenite: OMG, you guys are even more stalker-like than I thought, even I dont watch his every video
[2017-05-09 01:35:34 UTC] xanthis42: There was a tutorial on how to use rations on the level before it.
[2017-05-09 01:35:45 UTC] boxman222: also remember when he spent hours repeating the same shit over and over again because he did not know about crouch jump
[2017-05-09 01:35:50 UTC] xanthis42: I watch the edited highlight reels
[2017-05-09 01:35:57 UTC] sanguinenite: Oh god, please get your parents to help you guys out, mentally at least
[2017-05-09 01:35:58 UTC] xanthis42: Oh yes, that was delicious.
[2017-05-09 01:36:11 UTC] xanthis42: Can't. Moved out years ago.
[2017-05-09 01:36:13 UTC] ufccurbstomp: POUND THE FUCK
[2017-05-09 01:36:46 UTC] sanguinenite: How can your lives suck this much? That you would laugh at phil as if he is a bad person? Wow doods, talk about lowness of humanity, this is just part of it
[2017-05-09 01:37:31 UTC] boxman222: can you tell us of just one good or selfless thing he has done??
[2017-05-09 01:37:43 UTC] boxman222: everything i have seen makes him look like a horrible person
[2017-05-09 01:37:50 UTC] xanthis42: @boxman222 Remember in God of War when he couldn't get past that floor spear room?
[2017-05-09 01:38:12 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Or when he couldn't beat the Minotaur boss
[2017-05-09 01:38:22 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Tell me what to dooooooo!!!!
[2017-05-09 01:38:43 UTC] xanthis42: Or when he sang "Rape the Nyad"?
[2017-05-09 01:39:08 UTC] sanguinenite: Selfless? I think he did a few at least but even if I brought out examples, you guys will simply dispute it and disregard it
[2017-05-09 01:39:24 UTC] xanthis42: What we'd do is verify it.
[2017-05-09 01:39:36 UTC] xanthis42: We would check and see if it was true and then go from there.
[2017-05-09 01:39:42 UTC] sanguinenite: No, it is circled jerked by haters and then it becomes "verified"
[2017-05-09 01:39:49 UTC] boxman222: meanwhile i could come up with countless of horrible things he has done
[2017-05-09 01:40:05 UTC] xanthis42: Sexist comments for one.
[2017-05-09 01:40:17 UTC] boxman222: and that is just what he has shown and shared with us
[2017-05-09 01:40:19 UTC] sanguinenite: Do you guys not understand what a joke is
[2017-05-09 01:40:41 UTC] sanguinenite: Please get some commonsense
[2017-05-09 01:40:42 UTC] xanthis42: I'm a big fan of George Carlin, so yes.
[2017-05-09 01:40:45 UTC] boxman222: yeah i am sure it is just a joke to insult your own fans or subs and then ban them
[2017-05-09 01:40:52 UTC] sanguinenite: I like George Carlin too
[2017-05-09 01:41:09 UTC] sanguinenite: He made jokes about my race and I laughed so I dont see the problem
[2017-05-09 01:41:42 UTC] boxman222: i never said i thought he was racist
[2017-05-09 01:41:49 UTC] boxman222: that is one of the few things i disagree with
[2017-05-09 01:42:18 UTC] boxman222: but you cannot brush it off as a joke how he has treated his viewers
[2017-05-09 01:42:26 UTC] boxman222: or his real life friends
[2017-05-09 01:42:33 UTC] sanguinenite: He made sexist jokes but I found them funny so what? I believe there are women out there who are not offended at all
[2017-05-09 01:42:49 UTC] sanguinenite: there are even female patrons from the monthly patreon list
[2017-05-09 01:43:04 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Laveria CEO = stop doing this as a full-time job Phil
[2017-05-09 01:43:19 UTC] sanguinenite: LOL you guys are jealous, I get it
[2017-05-09 01:43:31 UTC] sanguinenite: You guys are jealous of phil for being able to play games for a full time job
[2017-05-09 01:43:49 UTC] sanguinenite: Why dont you be honest and say this is the real reason why you stalk phil?
[2017-05-09 01:44:53 UTC] xanthis42: Again you say stalk. Dude, we're not the SoK or the KWO or any of those groups. We aren't anywhere near as invested as they are and they have very little to do besides watch his videos to learn everything about him.
[2017-05-09 01:45:01 UTC] gxpopcorn69: hahaha
[2017-05-09 01:45:12 UTC] xanthis42: And how dare you assume they're women in this day and age.
[2017-05-09 01:45:25 UTC] gxpopcorn69: compilation
[2017-05-09 01:45:32 UTC] boxman222: if that was the case then there would be alot more worthy youtubers/streamers to "stalk"
[2017-05-09 01:45:47 UTC] boxman222: he barely even gets by now
[2017-05-09 01:46:00 UTC] boxman222: meanwhile there is plenty of larger youtubers i genuinely like
[2017-05-09 01:46:08 UTC] boxman222: so nothing to do with being jealous
[2017-05-09 01:46:25 UTC] boxman222: i still think you are troll and not actual fan ::P there is no way you can be this brainwashed
[2017-05-09 01:46:28 UTC] gxpopcorn69: dashiexp
[2017-05-09 01:46:36 UTC] xanthis42: I follow Maximilian and others. Phil? I laugh at without ever contributing a follow, subscription, or view.
[2017-05-09 01:46:52 UTC] xanthis42: That's the beauty of TIHYDPs
[2017-05-09 01:47:22 UTC] boxman222: it is also funny how i actually came with honest suggestions for him to improve if i was jealous and just wanted him gone
[2017-05-09 01:47:36 UTC] boxman222: i honestly just wanted him to wake up and change
[2017-05-09 01:47:58 UTC] xanthis42: If I had been clued into him years ago I would've been the same way, @boxman222
[2017-05-09 01:48:39 UTC] boxman222: i was even fooled once during one of his dspositive x.0
[2017-05-09 01:48:46 UTC] doritosmtndewz: I like Phil's TIHYDP but Phil? Nah. Are fans blind to what he does? Genuinely curious and I'm sure I'll be banned here for this but I do not care
[2017-05-09 01:49:00 UTC] boxman222: but turned out it was a bunch of lies and that he reverted to his same old within days
[2017-05-09 01:49:05 UTC] boxman222: then found out he had done this many times in the past
[2017-05-09 01:49:10 UTC] jimmoriarty76: are you even suprised?
[2017-05-09 01:49:11 UTC] boxman222: and has done it quite a few times since
[2017-05-09 01:49:24 UTC] xanthis42: How many months has he begged for patreon money?
[2017-05-09 01:49:33 UTC] xanthis42: Since he's made it, I think?
[2017-05-09 01:49:47 UTC] boxman222: now i have come to just understand he will never change, as he most likely is a narcissit
[2017-05-09 01:49:50 UTC] jimmoriarty76: He's been hardcore begging since December
[2017-05-09 01:50:04 UTC] gxpopcorn69: he made 500 vids on dspgaming alone WOAHH
[2017-05-09 01:50:12 UTC] gxpopcorn69: Kreygasm Kreygasm
[2017-05-09 01:50:18 UTC] xanthis42: Just today he's uploaded... one sec.
[2017-05-09 01:50:46 UTC] jimmoriarty76: I'm going to guess around 40 videos
[2017-05-09 01:50:49 UTC] xanthis42: 33 videos.
[2017-05-09 01:50:55 UTC] jimmoriarty76: damn, i wasn't far off
[2017-05-09 01:51:08 UTC] xanthis42: That's 33 in the last 24 hours.
[2017-05-09 01:51:21 UTC] xanthis42: Meanwhile, Markiplier's uploaded...
[2017-05-09 01:51:21 UTC] jimmoriarty76: and he wonders why he gets crap views on each one of them
[2017-05-09 01:51:35 UTC] gxpopcorn69: THATS ALOT
[2017-05-09 01:51:39 UTC] gxpopcorn69: OMG
[2017-05-09 01:51:41 UTC] boxman222: and all because he wanted to earn a few extra bucks that would have been lost if he uploaded it without monetization..
[2017-05-09 01:51:45 UTC] xanthis42: Markiplier's uploaded 2.
[2017-05-09 01:51:51 UTC] boxman222: as if people are going to watch 33 fucking videos
[2017-05-09 01:52:01 UTC] gxpopcorn69: ^
[2017-05-09 01:52:03 UTC] xanthis42: Give me a second to tally up the views
[2017-05-09 01:52:31 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Super Best Friends Play upload 2 a day. 3 at the most

[2017-05-09 02:02:07 UTC] xanthis42: But views don't matter to income, it's all the kahntent.
[2017-05-09 02:07:11 UTC] xanthis42: Feel free to ban me like Google will ban you, Phil~
[2017-05-09 02:14:17 UTC] ownager99: Those are all the "fake" Youtubers though everything they do is "scripted." Phil is such a dumbass that's what he believes.
[2017-05-09 02:20:13 UTC] zahvone: uh
[2017-05-09 02:20:16 UTC] zahvone: What's everyone doing here?

[2017-05-09 02:32:41 UTC] zahvone: Ah, that's good. Honestly your streams and videos have been keeping me good on content the past couple days
[2017-05-09 02:33:01 UTC] zahvone: That's one thing I do legitimately like about your style is that you put out a LOT of videos. Seriously.
[2017-05-09 02:35:41 UTC] darksydephil: yup thats alwyas kind of been my thing
[2017-05-09 02:35:56 UTC] zahvone: Keep it up man. :)
[2017-05-09 02:35:58 UTC] darksydephil: you usually dont have to wait a long time to see me beat a game, with a few exceptions for longer games
[2017-05-09 02:36:49 UTC] zahvone: I still don't understand how you're able to keep the conversation and jokes going though. That's...genetic.
[2017-05-09 02:40:25 UTC] darksydephil: its just improv/reactionary stuff most of the time. easy for me to do on the fly for whatever reason
[2017-05-09 02:41:36 UTC] zahvone: Would you consider yourself somewhat of a comedian?
[2017-05-09 02:43:44 UTC] juubeithehoobae: cheer20

[2017-05-09 03:25:15 UTC] sanguinenite: hahaha I am just trolling
[2017-05-09 03:25:25 UTC] sanguinenite: Arent you playing a game?
[2017-05-09 03:25:32 UTC] zahvone: Maybe ;o
[2017-05-09 03:25:43 UTC] zahvone: I'm also eating though lol
[2017-05-09 03:26:41 UTC] zahvone: Whatcha up to on a day like today? ;o
[2017-05-09 03:26:53 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I just am around the internet a lot, what time is it now
[2017-05-09 03:27:12 UTC] sanguinenite: My time zone is probably different from yours now it is morning
[2017-05-09 03:27:59 UTC] sanguinenite: Wait but can you see my comments? I am posting it on Phil's channel tho
[2017-05-09 03:29:16 UTC] sanguinenite: LOL okay I understand :)
[2017-05-09 03:29:22 UTC] zahvone: XD
[2017-05-09 03:30:52 UTC] sanguinenite: I paid a 5 minute visit to the trolls on SoK. I found it really sad that they get off stalk phil even more than I do as an ordinary supporter liking some of phils content. It was really quite...pathetic to see that such humans exist.
[2017-05-09 03:31:28 UTC] sanguinenite: And I also am surprised that phil's hosting your channel. Good that he is supporting his own people and supporters. :)
[2017-05-09 03:32:30 UTC] sanguinenite: Yup, "nite" is a good nickname
[2017-05-09 03:33:06 UTC] sanguinenite: I am not dont worry
[2017-05-09 03:33:17 UTC] sanguinenite: I just wanted to visit them as I would a hospital patient
[2017-05-09 03:33:39 UTC] zahvone: lmao
[2017-05-09 03:33:39 UTC] sanguinenite: I closed it after a while because I realised that they were lost
[2017-05-09 03:33:43 UTC] zahvone: That's dedication man
[2017-05-09 03:33:52 UTC] sanguinenite: No it is curiousity on my part
[2017-05-09 03:34:08 UTC] zahvone: I've tried to watch a video or two, I literally just can't. I actually get bored so fucking quick
[2017-05-09 03:34:21 UTC] sanguinenite: I do hope that one day they will listen to logical reasoning and see the error of their ways. I was bored I was only there to post comments
[2017-05-09 03:35:07 UTC] sanguinenite: You know, Zahvone, I was thinking... about why it wasnt like this 7 years ago when I first heard of Phil.
[2017-05-09 03:35:24 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I love chocolate anything
[2017-05-09 03:35:28 UTC] zahvone: XD
[2017-05-09 03:35:33 UTC] zahvone: hmm
[2017-05-09 03:35:42 UTC] zahvone: I have no clue. After this long you gain hatred I guess
[2017-05-09 03:35:59 UTC] sanguinenite: No, I think it is jealousy based
[2017-05-09 03:36:39 UTC] sanguinenite: I think the economic downturn worldwide did have a huge impact on why so many of them turned out to be such bitter cunts hating on phil, for the most irrational of reasons
[2017-05-09 03:37:15 UTC] zahvone: I think it's just boredom, honestly
[2017-05-09 03:37:22 UTC] zahvone: Jealousy, boredom, and bratty behaviors
[2017-05-09 03:37:28 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeah I agree
[2017-05-09 03:37:48 UTC] sanguinenite: boredom is a factor but jealousy is the deeper inner reason why they do it and RESENTMENT
[2017-05-09 03:38:18 UTC] sanguinenite: I find analyzing why people behave in the way they do very interesting.
[2017-05-09 03:39:28 UTC] sanguinenite: People that follow gossip and rely on making gossip about OTHERS is because they cannot stand thinking about how much a failure they themselves are.
[2017-05-09 03:39:38 UTC] zahvone: Dammit I just got mac and cheese on my mousepad
[2017-05-09 03:39:46 UTC] sanguinenite: oops
[2017-05-09 03:40:17 UTC] sanguinenite: Thats why when I eat, I tend to just run videos in Phil's playlist and not try to multi-task with a game
[2017-05-09 03:40:33 UTC] zahvone: xd
[2017-05-09 03:41:23 UTC] sanguinenite: So do you always play first-person shooters?
[2017-05-09 03:41:32 UTC] zahvone: Nope!
[2017-05-09 03:41:38 UTC] zahvone: Just happen to be playing one today. I play everything
[2017-05-09 03:44:10 UTC] sanguinenite: Me? I usually play narrative heavy games like Danganronpa and such. The other exceptions is Assassins Creed Multiplayer and Skyrim
[2017-05-09 03:45:08 UTC] sanguinenite: I know! I love mac and cheese and meat
[2017-05-09 03:46:18 UTC] sanguinenite: I heard that Danganronpa 2 is good. I hate Assassins Creed Singleplayer tho I never completed any Singleplayer
[2017-05-09 03:46:47 UTC] sanguinenite: But there is no Danganronpa 3, only anime from what I understand.
[2017-05-09 03:46:56 UTC] zahvone: It's coming soon I think
[2017-05-09 03:47:20 UTC] sanguinenite: Oh interesting. The more you know.... Oh and btw, is your mac and cheese homemade or boxed version?
[2017-05-09 03:47:48 UTC] sanguinenite: Yea multiplayer only XD
[2017-05-09 03:48:01 UTC] zahvone: xD
[2017-05-09 03:48:16 UTC] zahvone: I almost bought Danganronpa 1 and 2 because I couldn't take the blue balls from 2 streams ago
[2017-05-09 03:48:23 UTC] zahvone: The game is hilarious
[2017-05-09 03:51:40 UTC] sanguinenite: Oh god all I see is fire and ppl dying XD
[2017-05-09 04:17:33 UTC] zahvone: Kappa thanks for the conversation, @sanguinenite
[2017-05-09 04:17:37 UTC] zahvone: Ending stream now. GTA doesn't like OBS on my computer.

[2017-05-09 04:19:00 UTC] zahvone: Seriously, thanks! :)
[2017-05-09 04:23:35 UTC] sanguinenite: /me sees that Zahvone has gone off from Phil's chat.
[2017-05-09 04:23:50 UTC] sanguinenite: /me looks around
[2017-05-09 04:24:01 UTC] sanguinenite: /me proceeds to drink a glass of delicious troll tears
[2017-05-09 04:28:28 UTC] zahvone: Wtf lol
[2017-05-09 04:29:01 UTC] sanguinenite: hahahaha I have been posting these jokes when Phil isn't streaming (off hours)
[2017-05-09 04:31:36 UTC] zahvone: Really? lmao
[2017-05-09 04:32:09 UTC] sanguinenite: yeah that's why I posted the first line
[2017-05-09 04:32:15 UTC] sanguinenite: /me drinks a glass of water
[2017-05-09 04:32:28 UTC] sanguinenite: and then always following it by something like
[2017-05-09 04:32:38 UTC] sanguinenite: /me drinks a glass of delicious troll tears

[2017-05-09 05:52:47 UTC] jimmybuffettfan123: Can someone explain rule 9 to me? I don't get it??

[2017-05-09 17:48:52 UTC] kingjadvcmp: what's your take on the whole AdSense/MCN thing? To me it's been a big mess

[2017-05-09 18:05:53 UTC] deep_drive: hi 0megaj0ker
[2017-05-09 18:06:08 UTC] thesupervillain543: @theycallmejimbob its good to see legit dsp fans who arent here to make the same shitty jokes
[2017-05-09 18:06:17 UTC] thesupervillain543: dsp is a youtube legend imo
[2017-05-09 18:06:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: You haven't seen my jokes yet thesupervillain543 Kappa
[2017-05-09 18:06:29 UTC] thepastryarchy: Dude puts up with more shit than any Youtuber
[2017-05-09 18:06:34 UTC] deep_drive: scrooges jokes were NOT shitty
[2017-05-09 18:07:00 UTC] thesupervillain543: im talking about "get a job...bugged ___ mechanics"
[2017-05-09 18:07:07 UTC] thesupervillain543: unoriginal shit
[2017-05-09 18:07:13 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah scrooge's jokes the good ol days of IRC chat delta
[2017-05-09 18:07:13 UTC] solid_leonaras: @ThePastryarchy He puts out more shit than most youtubers too
[2017-05-09 18:07:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah I get you thesupervillain543
[2017-05-09 18:07:35 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: so with the newest WIP, looks like phil was never with a MCN?
[2017-05-09 18:07:40 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: i thought he did
[2017-05-09 18:07:45 UTC] deep_drive: no delta
[2017-05-09 18:07:50 UTC] deep_drive: he linked with one
[2017-05-09 18:07:54 UTC] yacherdy: trying to buy some vinyl but can't decide
[2017-05-09 18:07:54 UTC] jimmybuffettfan123: Yeah and everybody knows quantity > quality
[2017-05-09 18:07:54 UTC] thesupervillain543: how old are you guys btw
[2017-05-09 18:07:54 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well truthfully if your online content cannot sustain you, then as a responsible adult you SHOULD get a job to help - relying on fans to sustain it is dangerous IMO. I do hope Phil is trying to secure at least some work. Fans cannot keep paying forever
[2017-05-09 18:07:55 UTC] betheallen: i think Phil should play Darksiders 1 and 2 remastered in down time because he would need a refresher before darksiders 3
[2017-05-09 18:07:58 UTC] deep_drive: but in the end decided against signing the contract
[2017-05-09 18:08:00 UTC] thepastryarchy: Well, the "Bugged ___ mechanics" have been embraced as an inside meme now.
[2017-05-09 18:08:17 UTC] cherry_dood: Oh man. I'm not touching this MCN stuff and triggering him. He's been real touchy as of late when you just ask about it.
[2017-05-09 18:08:17 UTC] glibbibibble: @thesupervillain543 You should see LowTierGod sometime on Youtube
[2017-05-09 18:08:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I agree cherry I aint touching that topic with a 50ft pole :D

[2017-05-09 18:11:38 UTC] thepastryarchy: And I'm working ... while on 3 hours of sleep thanks to my smoke alarm :D
[2017-05-09 18:11:43 UTC] deep_drive: I think you'll have fun with prey today
[2017-05-09 18:11:53 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: looks like people in the comment section of the new WIP disagree with you @DarksydePhil . no hate intented
[2017-05-09 18:11:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn ThePastryarchy
[2017-05-09 18:12:00 UTC] betheallen: phil do you think you can play darksiders 1 and 2 remastered before darksiders 3 comes out? you need a refresher
[2017-05-09 18:12:06 UTC] yacherdy: @Zahvone lol sorry I missed it man, I'll try to tune in today...
[2017-05-09 18:12:07 UTC] a_scoundrel: Phil was staying up watching the infamous podcast
[2017-05-09 18:12:08 UTC] deep_drive: comment section is always negative delta
[2017-05-09 18:12:11 UTC] popsicolo: I don't have to get paint on my hands anymore PogChamp
[2017-05-09 18:12:24 UTC] jimmybuffettfan123: The fire alarm in my apartments goes off constantly so I just shove paper towels in the door

[2017-05-09 18:12:29 UTC] zahvone: @YaCherdy It's all good. No worries :)
[2017-05-09 18:12:33 UTC] kingjadvcmp: @Deep_Drive well there were a few inconsistencies IMO...
[2017-05-09 18:12:33 UTC] deep_drive: thats cool Zahvone have fun with that
[2017-05-09 18:12:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: You're becoming a sculptor ?
[2017-05-09 18:12:36 UTC] thesupervillain543: Darksiders were some damn good games. GOW rip offs that masked themselves well enough
[2017-05-09 18:12:39 UTC] zahvone: @Deep_Drive Thanks!
[2017-05-09 18:12:48 UTC] darksydephil: sooo

[2017-05-09 18:12:54 UTC] popsicolo: Actually, Jimbo, I am taking a sculpture class in the fall.
[2017-05-09 18:12:58 UTC] darksydephil: youtube adsense. yeah lol. things are looking horrible
[2017-05-09 18:13:02 UTC] yacherdy: god...maybe I should buy Pablo Honey for the lolkek

[2017-05-09 18:13:14 UTC] popsicolo: I wish I could say I'm graduating, but I have a few more classes left.
[2017-05-09 18:13:15 UTC] darksydephil: as in, it looks like adsense makes about half what the ad revenue of a partnered network makes
[2017-05-09 18:13:26 UTC] popsicolo: CLAY WutFace
[2017-05-09 18:13:27 UTC] darksydephil: im gonna give it one more day
[2017-05-09 18:13:29 UTC] thepastryarchy: Catastrophe, this.
[2017-05-09 18:13:40 UTC] jimmybuffettfan123: What happens after a day?
[2017-05-09 18:13:40 UTC] darksydephil: but its hilarious that this data isn't public
[2017-05-09 18:13:42 UTC] kingjadvcmp: we can talk about AdSense now? Great @DarksydePhil , I had a few questions about that.
[2017-05-09 18:13:44 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: you mean curse @Deep_Drive ?
[2017-05-09 18:13:48 UTC] a_scoundrel: So ur fucked?

[2017-05-09 18:14:03 UTC] deep_drive: sounds good...sometimes it takes a week to get good info on adrev phil
[2017-05-09 18:14:06 UTC] thesupervillain543: im not in the know
[2017-05-09 18:14:09 UTC] errnoent: wait, how come kingjad's mesasge got deleted?

[2017-05-09 18:14:22 UTC] errnoent: sup cherdy
[2017-05-09 18:14:22 UTC] darksydephil: its hilarious that everyone is saying MCNs are worthless, yet i've not directly tried going solo and the outcome looks like disaster lol
[2017-05-09 18:14:31 UTC] darksydephil: i've NOW, not not
[2017-05-09 18:14:37 UTC] betheallen: phil do you think you can play darksiders 1 and 2 remastered before darksiders 3 comes out? you need a refresher
[2017-05-09 18:14:46 UTC] jimmybuffettfan123: What?
[2017-05-09 18:14:51 UTC] a_scoundrel: Phil blown the fuck out lmaooooo
[2017-05-09 18:15:10 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: so you are going back to curse @DarksydePhil ?
[2017-05-09 18:15:18 UTC] darksydephil: im not even kidding. it looks like even days when im getting huge spiked views for new releases (Prey) the ad revenue on a normal adsense is awful
[2017-05-09 18:15:29 UTC] zachty200: hey phil and chat
[2017-05-09 18:15:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey zachty200
[2017-05-09 18:15:36 UTC] thesupervillain543: @DarksydePhil so what are your options
[2017-05-09 18:15:39 UTC] yacherdy: well the thing is you're basically a full time Twitch streamer anyway so if you're going to make this work I guess focus on Twitch as YouTube seems to be heading down the shitter for people who do your kind of content.
[2017-05-09 18:15:39 UTC] jimmybuffettfan123: But are you gonna stream video games?
[2017-05-09 18:15:41 UTC] cherry_dood: hey @zachty200
[2017-05-09 18:16:07 UTC] thepastryarchy: It seems to be the shitter for everyone though
[2017-05-09 18:16:15 UTC] yacherdy: well true
[2017-05-09 18:16:24 UTC] thesupervillain543: youtube is lowkey turning to shit in general
[2017-05-09 18:16:25 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: but youtube is half his income @YaCherdy
[2017-05-09 18:16:27 UTC] jimmybuffettfan123: I thought this was raw gameplay no bullshit
[2017-05-09 18:16:37 UTC] mr_izumi: VoHiYo
[2017-05-09 18:16:37 UTC] darksydephil: i just don't get how people were so misinformed about MCNs, lol
[2017-05-09 18:16:39 UTC] thesupervillain543: 2k youtubers and vloggers are the whats what nowadays
[2017-05-09 18:16:40 UTC] errnoent: Youtube just sounds like a big fucking hassle, why even bother I say
[2017-05-09 18:16:51 UTC] errnoent: time is money phil
[2017-05-09 18:16:54 UTC] thepastryarchy: It's like Phil said in the WIP video, even ol' Philly D had to adopt Patreon
[2017-05-09 18:17:02 UTC] thesupervillain543: and the dudes who make vids of them overreacting to basic shit in a video game
[2017-05-09 18:17:13 UTC] thesupervillain543: Jelly
[2017-05-09 18:17:16 UTC] thesupervillain543: Pewdiepie
[2017-05-09 18:17:17 UTC] zahvone: @DarksydePhil Start your own MCN.
[2017-05-09 18:17:19 UTC] thesupervillain543: that type of shit
[2017-05-09 18:17:25 UTC] cherry_dood: People thought MCNs were bad? That's exactly the opposite. I wouldn't go it alone if I were doing a channel, bro
[2017-05-09 18:17:31 UTC] yacherdy: Anyways as we all know its not just gamers...it's vloggers losing subs and money because of ads
[2017-05-09 18:17:38 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: MCNs are good
[2017-05-09 18:17:46 UTC] yacherdy: all you can do is try to change your content a bit and hope for the best.
[2017-05-09 18:17:46 UTC] thesupervillain543: what is an MCN
[2017-05-09 18:17:50 UTC] clesstheangei: last time i checked phil no one told you to go solo. You just did it out of nowhere. We all thought you were gonna get repartnered with another mcn, as you said earlier this week
[2017-05-09 18:17:58 UTC] yacherdy: #Adpocalpyse
[2017-05-09 18:18:01 UTC] deep_drive: Well most people don't know much about MCN's to be honest
[2017-05-09 18:18:17 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: you mean for phil to do more edited content @YaCherdy ?
[2017-05-09 18:18:18 UTC] hapticbabyman: dsp why not just go back to Curse?
[2017-05-09 18:18:22 UTC] jimmybuffettfan123: Am I in a game stream or a therapists office
[2017-05-09 18:18:26 UTC] thesupervillain543: what does MCN stand for
[2017-05-09 18:18:29 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @thesupervillain543 I believe it's short for Major Channel Network
[2017-05-09 18:18:29 UTC] darksydephil: i was going to get repartnered, but both MCNs i was working with ended up being full of shit so i tried the solo thing for a few days
[2017-05-09 18:18:33 UTC] yacherdy: @TheNewFaceofCreation If it was me, yes.
[2017-05-09 18:18:33 UTC] popsicolo: Man Crush November
[2017-05-09 18:18:53 UTC] cherry_dood: Things were fine with Curse. You said they'd take you back. Might just be safest to go back then.
[2017-05-09 18:18:56 UTC] thepastryarchy: Well, whatever you do, don't partner with Maker Studios :V
[2017-05-09 18:18:57 UTC] thesupervillain543: SKYLER THE MONEY
[2017-05-09 18:19:05 UTC] thesupervillain543: wheres the money
[2017-05-09 18:19:11 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @thesupervillain543 or Manage Channel Network
[2017-05-09 18:19:18 UTC] revivalhour: what do you mean they are full of shit? They were promising you stuff they couldn't deliver on?
[2017-05-09 18:19:23 UTC] errnoent: DarksydePhil if YT is your main source of income, you need to gtfo of there NOW. That model is unfortunately now a sinking ship. Whatever you do, better do it quick
[2017-05-09 18:19:25 UTC] thesupervillain543: @0megaj0ker ok thanks bro
[2017-05-09 18:19:26 UTC] dspfandood: phil can you remind people you made the patron choice thread. you havent mentioned it once
[2017-05-09 18:19:28 UTC] darksydephil: i could go back with Curse right now. like, instantly, it'd probably take them a day or less to put me back into their network. but its baffling me that ad revenue is SO LOW on a normal adsense lol
[2017-05-09 18:19:41 UTC] thesupervillain543: how low
[2017-05-09 18:19:46 UTC] deep_drive: Yeah you gotta be careful with the lesser known MCNs...they'll try and rope you into a shit contract
[2017-05-09 18:19:50 UTC] darksydephil: dspfandood , i PMed all patrons. thats a pretty big way to mention it lol
[2017-05-09 18:19:57 UTC] betheallen: phil do you think you can play darksiders 1 and 2 remastered before darksiders 3 comes out? you need a refresher
[2017-05-09 18:20:03 UTC] dspfandood: no one reads patron msges dood
[2017-05-09 18:20:07 UTC] dspfandood: lel
[2017-05-09 18:20:08 UTC] cherry_dood: well if it's low, it's low. Gotta move on from it and get back to Curse. Good luck.
[2017-05-09 18:20:12 UTC] dspfandood: come on
[2017-05-09 18:20:17 UTC] hapticbabyman: yeah so just do it, go back to Curse
[2017-05-09 18:20:19 UTC] errnoent: if h3h3 is complaining about youtube's new model, then Phil things are only going to get much worse for you..
[2017-05-09 18:20:21 UTC] yacherdy: cahman
[2017-05-09 18:20:23 UTC] jimmybuffettfan123: When does the stream start?
[2017-05-09 18:20:24 UTC] clesstheangei: bethe just wait for the patrons playthrough and do it that way lol
[2017-05-09 18:20:33 UTC] betheallen: chad my homie
[2017-05-09 18:20:37 UTC] yacherdy: my homie
[2017-05-09 18:20:41 UTC] darksydephil: have all of you who've been watching my YT videos been seeing the ads? ive checked random videos from like, all time periods and they all had them. so thats why im baffled the earnings are so bad
[2017-05-09 18:20:52 UTC] dspfandood: yeah just wait for danganronpa 2 since its winning KappaHD
[2017-05-09 18:20:59 UTC] jimmybuffettfan123: Yes I click on the ads too just like you told us too
[2017-05-09 18:21:01 UTC] thesupervillain543: how bad are they man
[2017-05-09 18:21:02 UTC] cherry_dood: I have YT Red, so I don't get ads.
[2017-05-09 18:21:05 UTC] thesupervillain543: i need a number range
[2017-05-09 18:21:14 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: maybe do more edited content darksydephil ?
[2017-05-09 18:21:18 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: just saying
[2017-05-09 18:21:19 UTC] grim_blades: MCN's work out ad deals with specific brands
[2017-05-09 18:21:24 UTC] dspfandood: fuck edited content
[2017-05-09 18:21:27 UTC] yacherdy: uh oh

[2017-05-09 18:22:13 UTC] hapticbabyman: Youtube earnings are based on a lot of things. CPM, viewer retention, where the views are from etc. could be any # of reasons they're low

[2017-05-09 18:24:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh boy
[2017-05-09 18:24:11 UTC] yacherdy: So I've been going on daily walks
[2017-05-09 18:24:16 UTC] yacherdy: feels nice mang
[2017-05-09 18:24:16 UTC] betheallen: i enjoyed them and as i recall phil enjoyed them too
[2017-05-09 18:24:31 UTC] hapticbabyman: adsense isn't handled by Google fwiw Phil; it's its own thing
[2017-05-09 18:24:35 UTC] yacherdy: I usually only walk/hike 2 or 3 times a week but I've become lazy and a fatass
[2017-05-09 18:24:39 UTC] betheallen: cherdy walks to the brothel eh?
[2017-05-09 18:24:42 UTC] yacherdy: yes
[2017-05-09 18:24:52 UTC] errnoent: Yeah, I don't know how much effort it requires for Phil to keep his youtube channels afloat, but it seems like it's not worth it. Definitely not going to get better either. Youtube's new model is very much working against Phil's video style (tons of long videos)
[2017-05-09 18:25:19 UTC] betheallen: cherdy be paying pimps for hoes
[2017-05-09 18:25:31 UTC] yacherdy: why the fack naht
[2017-05-09 18:25:38 UTC] errnoent: if I were in his shoes I'd be streaming on twitch and looking for another source of income that wasn't youtube, whatever that may be.
[2017-05-09 18:26:09 UTC] yacherdy: godamnit I ate too much cheese
[2017-05-09 18:26:17 UTC] yacherdy: now I'm bloated

[2017-05-09 18:26:22 UTC] cherry_dood: @errnoent If he's going to go solo on adsense, I'd say do raw stuff on Twitch for the first stream, then edit stuff for YT at night. No second stream.
[2017-05-09 18:26:22 UTC] yacherdy: this is bullshit
[2017-05-09 18:26:31 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob whaaaa
[2017-05-09 18:26:34 UTC] hapticbabyman: you mean tons of short videos?
[2017-05-09 18:26:36 UTC] cherry_dood: Edited has been the way to go for awhile.

[2017-05-09 18:27:22 UTC] mr_izumi: Really
[2017-05-09 18:27:24 UTC] daniellaveriawarren: adblocker ftw
[2017-05-09 18:27:24 UTC] errnoent: cherry_dood that's a good idea, but still don't think it'd provide enough income for a normal suburban life
[2017-05-09 18:27:28 UTC] betheallen: cherdy time to fart and burp all that cheese up
[2017-05-09 18:27:31 UTC] betheallen: :D

[2017-05-09 18:27:49 UTC] clesstheangei: I've been telling phil for a while now that editied videos is the "way of the future" but hes really hardheaded. Just being honest
[2017-05-09 18:27:50 UTC] yacherdy: that's for nasty humans
[2017-05-09 18:27:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he's here uf08mycat00 he's setting up

[2017-05-09 18:28:08 UTC] yacherdy: FUNgineer
[2017-05-09 18:28:16 UTC] cherry_dood: @ClessTheAngeI Edited is not the way of the future. It's the way of 2013.
[2017-05-09 18:28:25 UTC] errnoent: Unfortunately the way of the future is to no longer rely on youtube for income. Sad but true.
[2017-05-09 18:28:28 UTC] gxpopcorn69: haha
[2017-05-09 18:28:29 UTC] betheallen: cherdy well women like to say they dont but im sure they do

[2017-05-09 18:28:48 UTC] dspfandood: its never gonna work
[2017-05-09 18:28:52 UTC] bbt_2017: Why would I want to watch a playthrough with parts cut out?
[2017-05-09 18:29:00 UTC] hapticbabyman: edited videos can mean a lot of things; just cutting out Twitch footage for shorter Youtube vids isn't the kind of "edited video" most people on Youtube want to see
[2017-05-09 18:29:03 UTC] theycallmejimbob: nice new TinyBuild humble bundle YaCherdy SeemsGood
[2017-05-09 18:29:09 UTC] grim_blades: Most MCN;s recommend that Youtube Creators start secondary sources of income and to get brand deals

[2017-05-09 18:30:20 UTC] cherry_dood: The 30-40 minute vlogs are a time waster though, are they not? That time could be used in tons of different ways.
[2017-05-09 18:30:23 UTC] goutisserious: Phil you know being a Twitch streamer would make you 500x easier to troll
[2017-05-09 18:30:35 UTC] dspfandood: cherry dood its called muti tasking

[2017-05-09 18:30:59 UTC] hapticbabyman: sok podcast was an eye opener
[2017-05-09 18:31:09 UTC] errnoent: @DarksydePhil I think it would help to tell youtube to fuck off and spend the extra time you get from not dealing with that BS on bettering yourself by way of training/reading to prepare for a way to make income outside of youtube. Doesn't have to be unrelated to gaming
[2017-05-09 18:31:24 UTC] cherry_dood: sok is a dead brand, folks
