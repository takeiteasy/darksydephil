[2017-05-07 00:29:21 UTC] laveriaofficial: Yo Phil 1000 people are watching the SoK stream double what I've ever seen you have. Get bodied

[2017-05-07 00:39:38 UTC] maxfireiv: Kappa
[2017-05-07 00:40:42 UTC] sanguinenite: I will wait for the day that SoK gets a managed partnership with ANY MCN out there. LUL
[2017-05-07 00:41:02 UTC] maxfireiv: who is SoK
[2017-05-07 00:44:54 UTC] zahvone: huh
[2017-05-07 00:44:57 UTC] zahvone: What you guys doin' here
[2017-05-07 00:50:50 UTC] maxfireiv: running adblock, yourself?
[2017-05-07 00:50:51 UTC] maxfireiv: Kappa
[2017-05-07 00:50:52 UTC] maxfireiv: LUL
[2017-05-07 00:53:04 UTC] zahvone: uh
[2017-05-07 00:55:11 UTC] zahvone: How's everyone doing
[2017-05-07 01:02:04 UTC] sanguinenite: @Zahvone Oh hi! Doing... meh

[2017-05-07 01:02:21 UTC] zahvone: Why??
[2017-05-07 01:02:37 UTC] sanguinenite: Aw...its okay, just work related stuff
[2017-05-07 01:02:44 UTC] sanguinenite: but nothing too bad
[2017-05-07 01:03:02 UTC] sanguinenite: How about you bro @Zahvone ?
[2017-05-07 01:03:51 UTC] zahvone: Just got off work :c
[2017-05-07 01:04:02 UTC] sanguinenite: Aw... how was it today? tough?
[2017-05-07 01:04:42 UTC] zahvone: Nahhhh
[2017-05-07 01:05:00 UTC] sanguinenite: Then why the ":/" face
[2017-05-07 01:05:01 UTC] zahvone: barely had 20k fans
[2017-05-07 01:05:05 UTC] sanguinenite: :/ face I mean
[2017-05-07 01:05:11 UTC] sanguinenite: huh?
[2017-05-07 01:05:19 UTC] sanguinenite: 20K fans? You a streamer too?
[2017-05-07 01:05:24 UTC] zahvone: Ehm
[2017-05-07 01:05:27 UTC] zahvone: No lol
[2017-05-07 01:05:39 UTC] zahvone: I work for an Major league baseball team
[2017-05-07 01:05:54 UTC] zahvone: Barely had 20 thousand fans today at the game
[2017-05-07 01:05:59 UTC] sanguinenite: Ohhhhhhhhh you a referee or a player?
[2017-05-07 01:06:45 UTC] zahvone: I wish
[2017-05-07 01:06:58 UTC] zahvone: If that were the case I probably would have tipped Phil like 10 grand, to be honest
[2017-05-07 01:12:27 UTC] laveriaofficial: Lmao why would you tip Phil? All he does is shit on his fans
[2017-05-07 01:13:08 UTC] zahvone: Oh, wait my bad didn't see the message
[2017-05-07 01:13:12 UTC] zahvone: Uh
[2017-05-07 01:13:37 UTC] zahvone: Well, to be honest I tip him because it's my money, and because I wanted to.
[2017-05-07 01:13:43 UTC] sanguinenite: ^
[2017-05-07 01:13:53 UTC] laveriaofficial: Phil is a piece of shit stop giving him money. Donate to literally anyone else or a charity
[2017-05-07 01:13:57 UTC] zahvone: I mean, you still tip a waiter/tress even though they definitely talk shit about customers, yes?
[2017-05-07 01:14:02 UTC] sanguinenite: If I got a trillion dollars, I probably would tip phil some money too
[2017-05-07 01:14:21 UTC] zahvone: A large majority of charities aren't actually non for profit, so - you know.
[2017-05-07 01:14:24 UTC] laveriaofficial: You're a DSP fan you'd never have that amount of money lol.
[2017-05-07 01:14:32 UTC] zahvone: If you insist.
[2017-05-07 01:14:44 UTC] sanguinenite: I dont get where the trolls decide that they are the authority of whether DSP should be tipped or not
[2017-05-07 01:14:45 UTC] zahvone: Then again, I highly doubt you'd also come across a trillion dollars.
[2017-05-07 01:14:58 UTC] sanguinenite: LOL the SoK surely wont have a trillion dollars either
[2017-05-07 01:15:29 UTC] zahvone: Actually, I do believe that Elon Musk might be the first trillionaire
[2017-05-07 01:15:35 UTC] laveriaofficial: I never claimed I would but I have a good job and work hard don't complain about playing video games all week like thi fat lazy fuck
[2017-05-07 01:15:43 UTC] zahvone: Right now if I'm not mistaken, Tesla alone is worth about 900 billion
[2017-05-07 01:15:57 UTC] zahvone: @LAVERIAOFFICIAL But you have time to complain about a guy, who does that as a job
[2017-05-07 01:15:59 UTC] zahvone: lol
[2017-05-07 01:16:01 UTC] sanguinenite: @LAVERIAOFFICIAL If you are working so fucking hard, where the f you get time and energy to troll phil?
[2017-05-07 01:16:02 UTC] sanguinenite: XD
[2017-05-07 01:16:28 UTC] zahvone: I actually got off of work a couple hours ago. Was a good work day, actually
[2017-05-07 01:16:29 UTC] zahvone: Lot of fun
[2017-05-07 01:16:59 UTC] sanguinenite: Oh I wasnt talking about you Zahvone, I was talking to the "hard working" trolls of Phil like @LAVERIAOFFICIAL
[2017-05-07 01:17:37 UTC] zahvone: @sanguinenite I know, I was simply stating that I got off work. :p
[2017-05-07 01:17:51 UTC] sanguinenite: Oh good, bro @Zahvone
[2017-05-07 01:17:55 UTC] laveriaofficial: I'm not working 24/7 and it's not like I'm the only one. The majority of people that have heard of DSP hate him. And playing video games as a job is pathetic. I could see maybe if he was good but he is without a doubt the worst video game player getting paid for it
[2017-05-07 01:17:58 UTC] zahvone: @DarksydePhil I know you're there, Phil.
[2017-05-07 01:17:59 UTC] sanguinenite: Now you can rest
[2017-05-07 01:18:07 UTC] laveriaofficial: He's watching the SoK stream
[2017-05-07 01:18:27 UTC] laveriaofficial: You just want him to ban me so I can stop speaking truth
[2017-05-07 01:18:40 UTC] laveriaofficial: It's always the same nobody wants to hear the truth you're so brainwashed
[2017-05-07 01:18:40 UTC] zahvone: @LAVERIAOFFICIAL If I wanted him to ban you, I'd screen this conversation
[2017-05-07 01:18:41 UTC] zahvone: lol
[2017-05-07 01:18:59 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I dont really give a shit about the SoK. No not really, I just want you banned so you cry those delicious SALTY TEARS PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[2017-05-07 01:19:01 UTC] zahvone: That's the problem I have with people like you, is that you automatically assume I'm "out to get you". I'm just having casual conversation
[2017-05-07 01:19:06 UTC] zahvone: :p
[2017-05-07 01:19:14 UTC] sanguinenite: ^
[2017-05-07 01:19:26 UTC] laveriaofficial: Getting banned from DSP's chat oh god what will I do with my life.
[2017-05-07 01:19:37 UTC] zahvone: See, here's the thing
[2017-05-07 01:19:41 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeah I know, your only sense of meaning in life would be removed
[2017-05-07 01:19:51 UTC] laveriaofficial: How else will I chat with all the truly intellectual Twitch users
[2017-05-07 01:20:00 UTC] zahvone: Now you're trying to purposely say things to "trigger" me, which won't work. I do applaud you, however.
[2017-05-07 01:20:05 UTC] laveriaofficial: Yo @sanguinenite Coolguy says hi
[2017-05-07 01:20:15 UTC] sanguinenite: Hi trolls :3
[2017-05-07 01:20:25 UTC] laveriaofficial: I'm not trying to trigger you moron I'm trying to tell you the TRUTH
[2017-05-07 01:20:25 UTC] sanguinenite: do you like getting attention now?
[2017-05-07 01:20:30 UTC] zahvone: In anycase, I'm unsure who the worst gamer is. How do you actually measure that unless it's E-sports?
[2017-05-07 01:20:36 UTC] zahvone: Hm
[2017-05-07 01:20:42 UTC] zahvone: @LAVERIAOFFICIAL Do you watch e-sports?
[2017-05-07 01:20:50 UTC] laveriaofficial: I used to be a DSP fan I swear. But I couldn't take him making fun of everyone he's such an ass
[2017-05-07 01:20:52 UTC] sanguinenite: I know you trolls all are from broken families and lacked parental attention when you were young so I understand why you all lack a life
[2017-05-07 01:20:56 UTC] laveriaofficial: No I have a life and dignity
[2017-05-07 01:21:01 UTC] sanguinenite: outside of Phil's existence
[2017-05-07 01:21:09 UTC] zahvone: Ah, I see. So you're actually trying to just insult people, okay.
[2017-05-07 01:21:24 UTC] zahvone: @sanguinenite I wouldn't go for it, it's kind of sad actually.
[2017-05-07 01:21:38 UTC] laveriaofficial: Lmao my mom and dad have been together my whole life and are very happy. I've never seen them mad at each other
[2017-05-07 01:21:40 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I am just telling them the Truth they like so much
[2017-05-07 01:21:42 UTC] zahvone: I thought s/he would be able to actually hold some conversation but it would appear I was wrong.
[2017-05-07 01:22:09 UTC] sanguinenite: Laveria is obviously a troll so I was never talking him/her seriously lol
[2017-05-07 01:22:17 UTC] laveriaofficial: The SoK stream has 1200 viewers right now. I've never EVER seen Phil get that many views on a stream
[2017-05-07 01:22:20 UTC] zahvone: Same, I was curious, however.
[2017-05-07 01:22:26 UTC] laveriaofficial: Many more people hate him than like him
[2017-05-07 01:22:28 UTC] sanguinenite: Big whoop, tell you what
[2017-05-07 01:22:42 UTC] sanguinenite: come back with a managed partnership for SoK then we can talk
[2017-05-07 01:22:45 UTC] zahvone: That's crazy that you say that lol
[2017-05-07 01:22:56 UTC] laveriaofficial: Lmao do you know Laveria is just a scam
[2017-05-07 01:23:04 UTC] sanguinenite: lolol love him or hate him, why does it matter?
[2017-05-07 01:23:07 UTC] sanguinenite: views are views
[2017-05-07 01:23:07 UTC] zahvone: Because Summit has 20k constantly. I doubt SoK has ever even touched close to that.
[2017-05-07 01:23:08 UTC] laveriaofficial: Why brag about a manged partner that is shit
[2017-05-07 01:23:38 UTC] zahvone: Why brag about a twitch channel that's shit
[2017-05-07 01:23:39 UTC] zahvone: Kappa
[2017-05-07 01:23:41 UTC] laveriaofficial: So what Summit is actually good at a game that's tough. DSP Complains about playing video games all day and constantly begs for money
[2017-05-07 01:23:44 UTC] sanguinenite: @Zahvone lets ignore the idiot troll and have a conversation about facts rather than Bullshit lies
[2017-05-07 01:24:06 UTC] zahvone: Actually Summit does complain quite a bit - though he is quite funny. Seems like a genuine enough of a guy.
[2017-05-07 01:24:19 UTC] zahvone: @sanguinenite Relax, it's alright. :p
[2017-05-07 01:24:27 UTC] sanguinenite: lol asking for a tip is not begging, it is what ALL OTHER TWITCH STREAMERS DO so the haters and trolls are talking out of their ass.
[2017-05-07 01:24:38 UTC] laveriaofficial: See he has something entertaining about himself. Phil has never been funny only negative 24/7
[2017-05-07 01:24:57 UTC] zahvone: That's actually completely opinion.
[2017-05-07 01:25:01 UTC] sanguinenite: ^
[2017-05-07 01:25:02 UTC] laveriaofficial: Phil's idea of comedy is saying shitty dicks over and over again
[2017-05-07 01:25:07 UTC] zahvone: If you're going to spread a message, you might as well base it on fact.
[2017-05-07 01:25:11 UTC] sanguinenite: Says you loser troll
[2017-05-07 01:25:14 UTC] laveriaofficial: If you think DSP is funny you're immature plain and simple
[2017-05-07 01:25:23 UTC] laveriaofficial: I have all the videos to back it up
[2017-05-07 01:25:24 UTC] sanguinenite: says you loser troll, yet again :)
[2017-05-07 01:25:29 UTC] laveriaofficial: Not gonna link because of nightbot
[2017-05-07 01:25:32 UTC] zahvone: You seem like the kind of person who thinks earth is flat.
[2017-05-07 01:25:44 UTC] zahvone: Watch out guy, the government is coming.
[2017-05-07 01:25:48 UTC] sanguinenite: I think you're the kind of person that hates on anyone more successful than you.
[2017-05-07 01:25:51 UTC] laveriaofficial: You seem like the kind of person unable to accept other opinions
[2017-05-07 01:25:55 UTC] zahvone: Tjere
[2017-05-07 01:25:56 UTC] laveriaofficial: Extremely ignorant
[2017-05-07 01:26:00 UTC] zahvone: There's actually a difference.
[2017-05-07 01:26:04 UTC] sanguinenite: You're just upset that NOBODY wants to tip your ass for anything
[2017-05-07 01:26:12 UTC] zahvone: You can respect someones opinion, but you don't necessarily need to agree with them.
[2017-05-07 01:26:16 UTC] laveriaofficial: Lmao I make 26/hour working for Amazon
[2017-05-07 01:26:22 UTC] sanguinenite: LOL
[2017-05-07 01:26:24 UTC] laveriaofficial: I'm only 22 and doing pretty well
[2017-05-07 01:26:38 UTC] zahvone: I highly doubt anyone from Amazon would be so arrogant and unwitty.
[2017-05-07 01:26:41 UTC] sanguinenite: As what? a porn star management for the CEO?
[2017-05-07 01:26:49 UTC] zahvone: Then again, they did just build another factory.
[2017-05-07 01:26:56 UTC] laveriaofficial: I work in a warehouse on specialty music equipment.
[2017-05-07 01:27:13 UTC] laveriaofficial: Because I went to college against what DSP preaches so I could make money in my life
[2017-05-07 01:27:18 UTC] zahvone: Oh? It's funny you say that
[2017-05-07 01:27:27 UTC] zahvone: Because I also actually do work for Amazon.
[2017-05-07 01:27:35 UTC] sanguinenite: ^
[2017-05-07 01:27:39 UTC] laveriaofficial: You're dense as fuck
[2017-05-07 01:27:45 UTC] zahvone: Maybe in the pants, yes.
[2017-05-07 01:27:46 UTC] laveriaofficial: I thought you worked at a baseball stadium
[2017-05-07 01:27:47 UTC] sanguinenite: hahahaha
[2017-05-07 01:27:52 UTC] zahvone: It's called having two jobs.
[2017-05-07 01:28:04 UTC] zahvone: Aka the "work hard" you like to preach about.
[2017-05-07 01:28:11 UTC] sanguinenite: For an Amazon employee, you sure do have a lot of free time
[2017-05-07 01:28:15 UTC] laveriaofficial: It's called getting caught in a lie
[2017-05-07 01:28:16 UTC] zahvone: Working for a baseball org. Is mostly part time.
[2017-05-07 01:28:34 UTC] zahvone: Okay lol.
[2017-05-07 01:28:34 UTC] laveriaofficial: I don't work 24/7 idiot
[2017-05-07 01:28:37 UTC] sanguinenite: I mean, it is not like Amazon doesnt over-work their employees or anything like that
[2017-05-07 01:28:46 UTC] zahvone: Well, the thing about Amazon - though
[2017-05-07 01:28:51 UTC] zahvone: A lot of great benefits.
[2017-05-07 01:28:52 UTC] laveriaofficial: I've been here what maybe 5-10 minutes
[2017-05-07 01:28:59 UTC] zahvone: 30
[2017-05-07 01:29:00 UTC] laveriaofficial: True I've covered very well
[2017-05-07 01:29:11 UTC] sanguinenite: You sure fit the average view of what a real Amazon employee is. lol
[2017-05-07 01:29:26 UTC] laveriaofficial: Oh 30 minutes of my time here "thats not possible if you have a job huurrrr"
[2017-05-07 01:29:31 UTC] sanguinenite: I dont believe for a moment that you actually work at Amazon as an official work position
[2017-05-07 01:29:45 UTC] laveriaofficial: Sanguine you're an actual fuckin idiot zah you at least can make an arguement
[2017-05-07 01:29:48 UTC] zahvone: We have robots in our factory, what about you?
[2017-05-07 01:30:16 UTC] laveriaofficial: Some, but there are a lot of complicated musical equipment that they haven't been programmed for yet
[2017-05-07 01:30:30 UTC] zahvone: Hm...what do your robots do?
[2017-05-07 01:31:10 UTC] laveriaofficial: Move small packages around once they've been put into their boxes
[2017-05-07 01:31:22 UTC] laveriaofficial: Wanna the size of my cock too detective
[2017-05-07 01:31:23 UTC] sanguinenite: ADD sure is a good resume for Amazon now?
[2017-05-07 01:31:30 UTC] zahvone: No thanks, I've got my own.
[2017-05-07 01:31:51 UTC] zahvone: Ours tend to run around and check inventory, sorting, and moving smaller, to medium sized packages.
[2017-05-07 01:31:53 UTC] laveriaofficial: Because I type fast I have ADD? See what did I just say. Sanguine you're a fuckin clown
[2017-05-07 01:31:53 UTC] sanguinenite: Salty tears of the trolls are the best, makes me feel much better about my life hyperlul
[2017-05-07 01:31:59 UTC] zahvone: To the trucks, of course.
[2017-05-07 01:32:06 UTC] sanguinenite: lol proved my point
[2017-05-07 01:32:11 UTC] zahvone: @LAVERIAOFFICIAL How do you know he's a clown? Did you also attend clown college?
[2017-05-07 01:32:15 UTC] zahvone: (that's a real thing, by the way).
[2017-05-07 01:32:24 UTC] laveriaofficial: There are 1200 people talking shit about DSP right now. Just wanna remind you sanguine nobody is crying
[2017-05-07 01:33:03 UTC] sanguinenite: lol you all should join acting since you all love lying to yourselves
[2017-05-07 01:33:19 UTC] laveriaofficial: The stream chat is more active than Phil's has ever been. The only people talking in DSP's chat are about 10 subs jerking each other off
[2017-05-07 01:33:29 UTC] laveriaofficial: Google SoK hitbox
[2017-05-07 01:33:36 UTC] laveriaofficial: There are 1200 people in the chat
[2017-05-07 01:33:56 UTC] laveriaofficial: Watching videos of DipShitPhil and laughing at him. I'm not lying
[2017-05-07 01:34:08 UTC] sanguinenite: lol no, I am just focused on angering the trolls to get the salty troll tears PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[2017-05-07 01:34:32 UTC] zahvone: I don't exactly care how many people are in a streamchat, hence my being here. I also support small streamers.
[2017-05-07 01:34:40 UTC] zahvone: Except for boobie streamers. I hate that shit.
[2017-05-07 01:34:53 UTC] sanguinenite: I noticed that trolls always change the subject because they cannot stand up to any logical argument
[2017-05-07 01:34:56 UTC] laveriaofficial: I'm winning the argument quite substantially though. You seem to be the one crying. Zah is being mature about it
[2017-05-07 01:35:15 UTC] laveriaofficial: Sanguine you've had no arguments this whole time lmao
[2017-05-07 01:35:19 UTC] zahvone: I didn't realize we were having a court discussion just now - I haven't even prepared a suit.
[2017-05-07 01:35:41 UTC] sanguinenite: Now they want to nitpick about how many fans are in the chat. Lol talk about distraction tactics
[2017-05-07 01:35:46 UTC] laveriaofficial: See at least he makes bad jokes all you do it tell me I'm crying when I'm whooping your ass
[2017-05-07 01:35:51 UTC] laveriaofficial: NITPICK
[2017-05-07 01:35:51 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I am not even reading their ADD bullshit
[2017-05-07 01:35:51 UTC] zahvone: I'm dealing with this, as I would any fan at my other job. I deal with a lot of drunks, handicapped, and generally rude people.
[2017-05-07 01:36:00 UTC] laveriaofficial: This is how DSP makes money lmao are you retarded
[2017-05-07 01:36:25 UTC] sanguinenite: I am just making comments to anger the trolls to get THOSE DELICIOUS TROLL tears
[2017-05-07 01:36:34 UTC] sanguinenite: hahaha I am enjoying myself
[2017-05-07 01:36:43 UTC] zahvone: Gentleman, put your dicks away for now.
[2017-05-07 01:36:48 UTC] laveriaofficial: Haha alright peace gonna go watch the SoK stream actual quality content
[2017-05-07 01:37:17 UTC] zahvone: about as much quality as an underpaid chinese factory, I bet.
[2017-05-07 01:37:20 UTC] zahvone: Lol
[2017-05-07 01:37:27 UTC] sanguinenite: lol some of them might be teenage whores that lacked attention from their parents, now they are trying to get it from Phil or if they are ultra desperate, from DSP fans XD
[2017-05-07 01:37:39 UTC] zahvone: Good lord, man
[2017-05-07 01:37:42 UTC] sanguinenite: lol the ADD patient gave up
[2017-05-07 01:37:56 UTC] zahvone: Shit, I left my water in the fridge, be right back.
[2017-05-07 01:38:04 UTC] sanguinenite: KK
[2017-05-07 01:39:03 UTC] sanguinenite: I laugh at the SoK, if they have such "kwality kwantent" they should be more successful than Phil's entire channel. Oh wait, but they aint. SUCKS TO BE THEM. :3
[2017-05-07 01:39:05 UTC] znorts: sup ***
[2017-05-07 01:40:09 UTC] zahvone: Huh

[2017-05-07 01:40:40 UTC] znorts: you know how that goes
[2017-05-07 01:40:53 UTC] zahvone: You just reminded me I need to record some battlefield 1.
[2017-05-07 01:40:55 UTC] zahvone: Sigh
[2017-05-07 01:41:00 UTC] sanguinenite: hey Znorts
[2017-05-07 01:41:46 UTC] znorts: you boys ready for some danganronpa? Kappa
[2017-05-07 01:42:01 UTC] sanguinenite: My body is ready...
[2017-05-07 01:42:09 UTC] sanguinenite: /me looks around excitedly
[2017-05-07 01:42:37 UTC] zahvone: /me Checks his mouth down south
[2017-05-07 01:42:42 UTC] zahvone: /me realizes he doesn't have one
[2017-05-07 01:42:45 UTC] zahvone: /me is still wet, somehow.
[2017-05-07 01:42:47 UTC] zahvone: Yeah I'm ready.
[2017-05-07 01:43:58 UTC] sanguinenite: XD
[2017-05-07 01:44:28 UTC] sanguinenite: /me has yet to hear the term "Mouth down south" in any porn flick
[2017-05-07 01:44:51 UTC] zahvone: That has the be one of the greatest things I've ever heard in an rpg man
[2017-05-07 01:45:06 UTC] zahvone: Not sure why but @LAVERIAOFFICIAL is still here. Tsk tsk
[2017-05-07 01:45:10 UTC] sanguinenite: :D
[2017-05-07 01:45:19 UTC] sanguinenite: His ADD is about to strike at any time
[2017-05-07 01:45:20 UTC] sanguinenite: ...
[2017-05-07 01:45:32 UTC] sanguinenite: /me waits for the return of the ADD patient
[2017-05-07 01:46:33 UTC] sanguinenite: /me still doesnt believe that he is an employee of Amazon,
[2017-05-07 01:46:38 UTC] zahvone: We've got about an hour, don't we?
[2017-05-07 01:46:54 UTC] sanguinenite: Is he going to start at 7pm PDT?
[2017-05-07 01:46:58 UTC] zahvone: Yes
[2017-05-07 01:47:12 UTC] sanguinenite: Only 13 minutes left till then If I am not wrong
[2017-05-07 01:47:24 UTC] zahvone: Oh, hell yeah. Good, good.
[2017-05-07 01:49:32 UTC] sanguinenite: I think find it hilarious that the ADD patient thought I was trying to have a logical debate with his ignorant ass
[2017-05-07 01:50:00 UTC] sanguinenite: I obviously wouldnt waste my logic and take the time to make a logical argument since trolls reject logic all the time XD
[2017-05-07 01:50:22 UTC] sanguinenite: When they cannot win when they argue with me, they run away and ignore me or call me names. BECAUSE IT IS ALL THEY CAN DO XD
[2017-05-07 01:50:48 UTC] zahvone: hmm
[2017-05-07 01:50:59 UTC] zahvone: I'm hungry now.
[2017-05-07 01:56:00 UTC] deep_drive: Hiya. Anyone here?
[2017-05-07 01:56:04 UTC] sanguinenite: I find it quite sad that the trolls have to cheer bits just to get some youutube exposure

[2017-05-07 01:58:23 UTC] sanguinenite: It is so obvious who the trolls are at this point

[2017-05-07 01:59:03 UTC] ornightz: Whoh
[2017-05-07 01:59:05 UTC] rnrs: human interactions / reactions is intriguing to me
[2017-05-07 01:59:08 UTC] rnrs: I'm weird like that
[2017-05-07 01:59:08 UTC] toxicchaz: AY PHILLY BOY IS HERE

[2017-05-07 01:59:24 UTC] sanguinenite: You can remove your cheer badge at any time
[2017-05-07 01:59:27 UTC] zahvone: Fuck dude I saw @DarksydePhil and a tank showed up in BF1 lol
[2017-05-07 01:59:30 UTC] deep_drive: for some reason it was turned off in settings
[2017-05-07 01:59:34 UTC] deep_drive: twitch is weird
[2017-05-07 01:59:41 UTC] darksydephil: thats the first time ive seen that happen lol
[2017-05-07 02:00:07 UTC] zahvone: Actually uh..Phil - are you absolutely sure you don't want to use Revlo? I mean I think it's time to add more functionality Kappa
[2017-05-07 02:00:09 UTC] sanguinenite: Users on twitch can hide their true cheer count and who they are subbed to
[2017-05-07 02:00:09 UTC] rnrs: I always fight over if I should show my twitch prime badge or the turbo badge
[2017-05-07 02:00:19 UTC] zahvone: Prime badge
[2017-05-07 02:00:24 UTC] toxicchaz: phil do you ever plan on returning to bloodborne?
[2017-05-07 02:00:28 UTC] toxicchaz: not trolling
[2017-05-07 02:00:34 UTC] toxicchaz: serious question :)
[2017-05-07 02:00:37 UTC] zahvone: I don't know why but the Prime badge actually looks like a staff badge
[2017-05-07 02:00:39 UTC] deep_drive: ahahaha the bloodborne question again
[2017-05-07 02:00:40 UTC] megamannt125: C'mon man he's addressed this legit at least 40 times
[2017-05-07 02:00:44 UTC] rnrs: "ohhh I pay $100 a year for two day shipping let me show that off"
[2017-05-07 02:00:50 UTC] toxicchaz: @Megamannt125 sorry i'm new
[2017-05-07 02:00:51 UTC] znorts: bloodborne has been sold
[2017-05-07 02:01:00 UTC] megamannt125: save file deleted
[2017-05-07 02:01:00 UTC] znorts: unless you want to buy it for philip Kappa
[2017-05-07 02:01:01 UTC] megamannt125: no cloud
[2017-05-07 02:01:02 UTC] zahvone: Bloodborne is out already?!
[2017-05-07 02:01:16 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I dont really care about if they are serious questions or not :) but it is Phil's chat and if he wants trolls on it, it is own choice :)
[2017-05-07 02:01:34 UTC] jwalker70: So I had a mind blowing realization about the plot last night.
[2017-05-07 02:01:36 UTC] znorts: most of the viewers are trolls Kappa
[2017-05-07 02:01:42 UTC] zahvone: I mean
[2017-05-07 02:01:45 UTC] zahvone: I'm short, but I'm not a troll.
[2017-05-07 02:01:49 UTC] megamannt125: Everyone is trolls
[2017-05-07 02:01:51 UTC] megamannt125: Even Phil is a troll
[2017-05-07 02:01:57 UTC] toxicchaz: @Znorts i feel like most people are just here to mess with phil at this point it's sad
[2017-05-07 02:02:06 UTC] deep_drive: of danganronpa jwalker70?
[2017-05-07 02:02:10 UTC] sanguinenite: lol might be since the trolls actually watch more of phils videos than i do, and they call me the fanboy when they are so much bigger fans of phil XD
[2017-05-07 02:02:17 UTC] jwalker70: you no how junko had her face blocked out in the group photo?
[2017-05-07 02:02:24 UTC] znorts: ironic fans Kappa
[2017-05-07 02:02:30 UTC] megamannt125: Think Phil noticed that too
[2017-05-07 02:02:34 UTC] toxicchaz: fuck me daddy i'm outskis
[2017-05-07 02:02:46 UTC] jwalker70: the 16th student however has Junko's eyes
[2017-05-07 02:02:46 UTC] deep_drive: well her face was in mukuros but sort of hidden
[2017-05-07 02:02:57 UTC] jwalker70: exactly
[2017-05-07 02:03:11 UTC] megamannt125: Mukuro Ikusaba...
[2017-05-07 02:03:16 UTC] zahvone: Anyone excited for crash bandicoot remaster? <3
[2017-05-07 02:03:21 UTC] megamannt125: The sixteenth student, lying hidden somewhere in this school...
[2017-05-07 02:03:21 UTC] jwalker70: I think mukuro is junko
[2017-05-07 02:03:22 UTC] deep_drive: i fully expect the ending to explain the game :D
[2017-05-07 02:03:26 UTC] megamannt125: The one they call the Ultimate Depsiar...
[2017-05-07 02:03:28 UTC] megamannt125: Watch out for her.
[2017-05-07 02:03:33 UTC] znorts: it's probably gonna be shit
[2017-05-07 02:03:34 UTC] zahvone: @Megamannt125 Sounds a lot like my ex.
[2017-05-07 02:03:38 UTC] znorts: like most remasters
[2017-05-07 02:03:40 UTC] sanguinenite: I already know the ending so I wont spoil you guys <3
[2017-05-07 02:03:42 UTC] deep_drive: ahhh so the main character is the mastermind then
[2017-05-07 02:03:47 UTC] jwalker70: the only thin I'm stumped on his how she hid the tatoo
[2017-05-07 02:03:48 UTC] deep_drive: interesting
[2017-05-07 02:03:56 UTC] zahvone: @Znorts It's actually a proper remaster. 3 games rebuilt with new technologies and stuff
[2017-05-07 02:04:07 UTC] sanguinenite: @jwalker70 I want to know how she did that too
[2017-05-07 02:04:08 UTC] znorts: Kappa
[2017-05-07 02:04:14 UTC] znorts: we'll see if sony fucks it up or not
[2017-05-07 02:04:20 UTC] zahvone: dspSurpriseddsp dspSurpriseddsp dspSurpriseddsp dspSurpriseddsp
[2017-05-07 02:04:27 UTC] megamannt125: So is Phil starting the stream 30 minutes later than usual?
[2017-05-07 02:04:32 UTC] zahvone: I can't wait man. I told my girlfriend to leave me alone during those days
[2017-05-07 02:04:36 UTC] zahvone: Kappa
[2017-05-07 02:04:37 UTC] deep_drive: dspHmm apparently there are two ultimate despairs according to the diary too
[2017-05-07 02:05:03 UTC] znorts: her head game isn't as good as crash? Kappa
[2017-05-07 02:05:09 UTC] znorts: smh
[2017-05-07 02:05:41 UTC] znorts: send her the grapefruit video, that's a start
[2017-05-07 02:05:52 UTC] megamannt125: We're all Ultimate Despair's now
[2017-05-07 02:06:18 UTC] deep_drive: Chat for danganronpa seems to be more talking about the game than any other game I've seen Phil play
[2017-05-07 02:06:33 UTC] sanguinenite: ^
[2017-05-07 02:06:38 UTC] jwalker70: thats because we want to guess the plot
[2017-05-07 02:06:42 UTC] zahvone: back
[2017-05-07 02:06:43 UTC] znorts: never been to a danganronpa stream
[2017-05-07 02:06:53 UTC] zahvone: @Znorts Nah man, Coco got that wumpa fruit action
[2017-05-07 02:06:56 UTC] deep_drive: all try to figure out the mystery
[2017-05-07 02:06:56 UTC] jwalker70: there's only been 3
[2017-05-07 02:06:57 UTC] thepastryarchy: DiggityRompa is very focused right now. A lot of people get off track with other games cuz there's a degree of grind or sidequest searching and stuff going on.
[2017-05-07 02:07:09 UTC] znorts: MingLee @Zahvone
[2017-05-07 02:07:18 UTC] thepastryarchy: So they start talking about other things since wandering around doesn't really make for decent talking points.
[2017-05-07 02:07:29 UTC] zahvone: Dat WUMPA dspHmm dspHmm dspSurpriseddsp
[2017-05-07 02:07:32 UTC] jwalker70: here's a wild theory.
[2017-05-07 02:07:46 UTC] jwalker70: Maybe the body is both Junko and mukuro
[2017-05-07 02:08:01 UTC] jwalker70: and they used the bomb to merge the guts together
[2017-05-07 02:08:02 UTC] deep_drive: Well there is free time in danganronpa (which you can skip) but there hasn't been any in the streams (i think?)
[2017-05-07 02:08:16 UTC] zahvone: Maybe it's actually the axe body wash scrub coming back to kill Phil
[2017-05-07 02:08:18 UTC] zahvone: lol
[2017-05-07 02:08:23 UTC] darksydephil: ok setting up nwo
[2017-05-07 02:08:27 UTC] thepastryarchy: I hope the twist isn't super lame, like taking some supernatural twist or something
[2017-05-07 02:08:27 UTC] darksydephil: now
[2017-05-07 02:08:28 UTC] zahvone: Oh shit
[2017-05-07 02:08:29 UTC] jwalker70: hey darks
[2017-05-07 02:08:32 UTC] zahvone: Phil is starting the NWO
[2017-05-07 02:08:39 UTC] sanguinenite: lol
[2017-05-07 02:08:48 UTC] zahvone: Next week he's going to be on WWE
[2017-05-07 02:08:50 UTC] deep_drive: ...and so the finale begins
[2017-05-07 02:09:07 UTC] sanguinenite: @Deep_Drive DSP never skipped the free time
[2017-05-07 02:09:55 UTC] sanguinenite: I still remember the Axe body wash review, it was funny af
[2017-05-07 02:09:59 UTC] megamannt125: Was too busy romancing Hina
[2017-05-07 02:10:01 UTC] zahvone: It was great
[2017-05-07 02:10:04 UTC] zahvone: Hina doe
[2017-05-07 02:10:15 UTC] megamannt125: We all know Toko is Best Girl
[2017-05-07 02:10:16 UTC] thepastryarchy: I was actually gunna go play Horizon Zero Dawn in a moment, but then I remembered the DangitWumpus stream, so I'll work for another 2 hours while this goes xD. My work thanks you,, Phil.
[2017-05-07 02:10:20 UTC] jwalker70: I miss when Phil did skits in his vlogs
[2017-05-07 02:10:20 UTC] deep_drive: nope...skipping free time is dumb because you can get skills for trials
[2017-05-07 02:10:33 UTC] sanguinenite: @jwalker70 me too :/
[2017-05-07 02:10:49 UTC] zahvone: Has anyone gone back to the DSPClassics channel recently?
[2017-05-07 02:10:50 UTC] deep_drive: lol that was a long time ago jwalker70
[2017-05-07 02:11:00 UTC] deep_drive: not for like a month Zahvone
[2017-05-07 02:11:01 UTC] jwalker70: I'm old school
[2017-05-07 02:11:05 UTC] megamannt125: Hey @DarksydePhil you been watching the new season of Attack on Titan?
[2017-05-07 02:11:10 UTC] ssjram: Hey, guys.
[2017-05-07 02:11:18 UTC] zahvone: @Deep_Drive The "I'm back" video is fucking great man
[2017-05-07 02:11:19 UTC] deep_drive: he has some great classic playthroughs though
[2017-05-07 02:11:25 UTC] zahvone: He really does
[2017-05-07 02:11:29 UTC] thepastryarchy: Attack on Titan is finally resuming?
[2017-05-07 02:11:33 UTC] zahvone: Yes

[2017-05-07 02:11:55 UTC] zahvone: @ThePastryarchy I gotta admit, that username is fantastic lol
[2017-05-07 02:11:56 UTC] megamannt125: Yeah it's on Episode 6 of S2 rn
[2017-05-07 02:12:16 UTC] zahvone: @Deep_Drive It's the video where he's talking about Youtube and getting laid off and him going full time on youtube, etc.
[2017-05-07 02:12:18 UTC] megamannt125: I already read the manga but seeing it all in motion is phenomenal
[2017-05-07 02:12:19 UTC] sanguinenite: I always wait for the end of the season so I can watch the whole season all at once
[2017-05-07 02:12:24 UTC] thepastryarchy: Thanks, @Zahvone doodBenny
[2017-05-07 02:12:36 UTC] zahvone: Lmao
[2017-05-07 02:12:50 UTC] mxtt10589: hi, just jumping in, attack on titan?
[2017-05-07 02:12:52 UTC] zahvone: @DarksydePhil If you need a community manager, I'm all fingers, buddy.
[2017-05-07 02:12:59 UTC] zahvone: Of course you'll have to pay me in five gum.
[2017-05-07 02:13:03 UTC] jwalker70: are we live yet?
[2017-05-07 02:13:13 UTC] thepastryarchy: Nah, the stream was 7:30, wasn't it?
[2017-05-07 02:13:13 UTC] mxtt10589: 7:30 his time
[2017-05-07 02:13:24 UTC] sanguinenite: no doesnt seem like it 7:30 I thought it was 7:00
[2017-05-07 02:13:26 UTC] jwalker70: Phil could actually use a community manager
[2017-05-07 02:13:27 UTC] zahvone: You have about 15 minutes to power fap.
[2017-05-07 02:13:41 UTC] zahvone: I'm quite decent at community management, actually.
[2017-05-07 02:13:42 UTC] deep_drive: hell probably start the game around 730
[2017-05-07 02:13:48 UTC] megamannt125: The fuck is a Community Manager?
[2017-05-07 02:13:50 UTC] mxtt10589: he tweeted not long ago that its at 7:30
[2017-05-07 02:13:54 UTC] thepastryarchy: So you got time to eat Burger King and then have a violent shit, it's all good.
[2017-05-07 02:14:05 UTC] deep_drive: Zahvone, pardon my ignorance but what is a community manager?
[2017-05-07 02:14:10 UTC] megamannt125: I think he'll start the prestream at 7:30 and actual gameplay at 8
[2017-05-07 02:14:11 UTC] zahvone: @Megamannt125 Someone who organizes events, oversees the community as a whole, tries to get everyone happy, etc etc
[2017-05-07 02:14:14 UTC] jwalker70: someone who manages a community?
[2017-05-07 02:14:42 UTC] zahvone: Essentially someone who is (in this case) in the know of the community, starts events, answers questions, gets people talking, etc etc
[2017-05-07 02:14:46 UTC] deep_drive: How do you keep the detractors happy? would be a hard job Kappa
[2017-05-07 02:14:53 UTC] sanguinenite: lol
[2017-05-07 02:14:57 UTC] vendatus: like Tyler Lansdown, Deej, or Cosmo MingLee
[2017-05-07 02:15:08 UTC] zahvone: @Deep_Drive Not really - lol
[2017-05-07 02:15:10 UTC] raikumo93: what are your qualifications?
[2017-05-07 02:15:12 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeah they would need someone to give them attention every 5 seconds, especially when phil ignores them
[2017-05-07 02:15:15 UTC] mxtt10589: by spamming freedom chat would probably annoy them
[2017-05-07 02:15:19 UTC] zahvone: They seem to be quite efficient at sustaining their own happiness
[2017-05-07 02:15:25 UTC] jwalker70: All we got for a community Manager is Onxy
[2017-05-07 02:15:37 UTC] deep_drive: onyx
[2017-05-07 02:15:37 UTC] sanguinenite: Who's onxy?
[2017-05-07 02:15:39 UTC] darksydephil: ok stream starting now
[2017-05-07 02:15:41 UTC] zahvone: @RaiKumo93 I've managed 3 communities - one of which had thousands of players (GTA SAMP) for several years
[2017-05-07 02:15:54 UTC] jwalker70: @sanguinenite exactly
[2017-05-07 02:15:58 UTC] zahvone: The proper definition: a community manager builds, grows, and manages online communities, performing Community management, often around a brand or cause.
[2017-05-07 02:16:09 UTC] dspfandood: ResidentSleeper
[2017-05-07 02:16:17 UTC] toxicchaz: hey my dudes whomst'd eatin cheese tonight
[2017-05-07 02:16:18 UTC] deep_drive: onyx came to the nioh stream for like 10 minutes...that was pretty cool
[2017-05-07 02:16:27 UTC] jwalker70: I like how they use Community management, in the definition
[2017-05-07 02:16:32 UTC] zahvone: I'm eating...cheese ruffles, if that helps.
[2017-05-07 02:16:34 UTC] sanguinenite: was he a troll or a legit mod?
[2017-05-07 02:16:36 UTC] zahvone: @jwalker70 I know, it's silly lol
[2017-05-07 02:16:40 UTC] elipsion: @DarksydePhil Hey Phil when is the Nioh gameplay going to be uploaded
[2017-05-07 02:16:44 UTC] raikumo93: @zahvone whoa, that is something. PogChamp
[2017-05-07 02:16:46 UTC] thepastryarchy: Oh man, I can't wait to see the continuation of the Nioh DLC. The last boss of that DLC ... fuck that boss :P. Even at level 205, it still destroyed me.
[2017-05-07 02:16:54 UTC] jwalker70: he's the created of the website
[2017-05-07 02:16:55 UTC] deep_drive: Community manager: one who does community management
[2017-05-07 02:17:01 UTC] deep_drive: There perfect definition
[2017-05-07 02:17:02 UTC] toxicchaz: is nioh worth buying a ps4?
[2017-05-07 02:17:02 UTC] znorts: @Elipsion never:30, along side scarfac
[2017-05-07 02:17:05 UTC] znorts: e
[2017-05-07 02:17:13 UTC] toxicchaz: it looks kind of meh to me
[2017-05-07 02:17:13 UTC] zahvone: Community manager - a person whom a community is managed by.
[2017-05-07 02:17:16 UTC] sanguinenite: lol someone followed me during the Nioh DLC, because I think I said something that really angered ADD children
[2017-05-07 02:17:42 UTC] thepastryarchy: Dude, Nioh's combat is so much more fun than Dark Souls. But if you like level design and high enemy variety, you'd get more let down by Nioh.
[2017-05-07 02:17:55 UTC] jwalker70: "It's lines and dots!!!!"
[2017-05-07 02:18:02 UTC] toxicchaz: yeah level design is my favorite part of the souls series
[2017-05-07 02:18:04 UTC] vendatus: Nioh uploaded probably Monday since it's his day off but who knows MingLee
[2017-05-07 02:18:09 UTC] jwalker70: anyone get that reference?
[2017-05-07 02:18:19 UTC] toxicchaz: @jwalker70 mah
[2017-05-07 02:18:22 UTC] toxicchaz: nah*
[2017-05-07 02:18:34 UTC] thepastryarchy: Yeah, you're not gunna see interesting level design in Nioh, but the combat is excellent and very responsive.
[2017-05-07 02:18:34 UTC] jwalker70: achievement hunter
[2017-05-07 02:18:48 UTC] znorts: level design and tactics are what dark souls are all about
[2017-05-07 02:18:52 UTC] zahvone: Wtf

[2017-05-07 02:19:06 UTC] toxicchaz: for honor really let me down with the bad online mechanics but the combat is so fucking good

[2017-05-07 18:10:22 UTC] darksydephil: if you haven't noticed, i haven't talked about any MCN. that's completely on purpose. which is why that podcast last night was completely irrelevant and a joke, a bunch of completely misinformed dumbfucks. when i'm ready to announce what i'm doing i will do so

[2017-05-07 18:19:11 UTC] bethebaby: @cherry_dood DarkSydeHighSchool looooves to talk about the haters. They talk more about them than the "haters" talk about Phil FFS.
[2017-05-07 18:19:30 UTC] sanguinenite: The best way to handle them is to just ban them from the chat and ignore them completely. They get most irritated when you just block them from the chat and ban them from chat. The salt will then rain down PJSalt
[2017-05-07 18:19:33 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Laveria Media is the network claiming KO Gaming, going by Socialblade?

[2017-05-07 20:13:27 UTC] stuart360: But the only reason why people cared what Sean Murray was saying is because the game was constantly hyped to the max. Without the hype, the game would proibably of failed on Steam, just like 8 out of 10 Indie games do

[2017-05-07 20:13:45 UTC] wolflink659: Woah, Sean Murray's lies were caused by Sony's massive propaganda on the game.
[2017-05-07 20:14:06 UTC] sonicsergey: huh?
[2017-05-07 20:14:13 UTC] ellietsantiara: He promised Multiplayer, Base building, ship customizing and Fun space battles. Non of that were in the game until about a couple of months that they updated and put more buildings
[2017-05-07 20:14:24 UTC] applethiefx: San Murray told those lies himself lol Sony wasn't in the back with a gun to his head.
[2017-05-07 20:14:33 UTC] conky89: It did fail though. It was so disappointing and had so much lies attached to it that Steam and major retailers actually allowed people to get a full refund of the game
[2017-05-07 20:14:53 UTC] stuart360: It didn't fail sales wise
[2017-05-07 20:15:07 UTC] blue_blur64: it did with player retention though :P
[2017-05-07 20:15:17 UTC] wolflink659: @applethiefx They kinda were. No Man's Sky was originally a vague indie title. Sony played it off as the best fucking game on the planet. Sean Murray went with it.
[2017-05-07 20:15:21 UTC] conky89: But it quickly had a major player drop off and people got refunded for it like I said

[2017-05-07 20:23:19 UTC] applethiefx: Because technology moves way too fast this day in age for closed systems like consoles to be viable anymore
[2017-05-07 20:23:20 UTC] bethebaby: @Chem_Zegarra2018 I just said why; console gens are always, on average, 5 years. Last gen was a major exception.

[2017-05-07 20:35:28 UTC] blk_mage_ctype: The Switch could be successful if only Nintendo would stop trying to milk every last penny out of the 3DS by admitting that the Switch is indeed a successor to it, but nah, just keep saying it's a console.

[2017-05-07 23:45:04 UTC] podusmonens: it's not a debate, it's just a conversation
[2017-05-07 23:45:08 UTC] biggershekel: Destiny is more concerned with fugging his own daughter
[2017-05-07 23:45:08 UTC] pcgamehunter: Phil will respond if he wants
[2017-05-07 23:45:09 UTC] georgetdawson: I'm sure he does

[2017-05-07 23:53:15 UTC] podusmonens: phil needs to be more aware of the community. if a bigger streamer wants to talk publicly, I don't see why he'd say no

[2017-05-07 23:53:56 UTC] darksydephil: not to fucking talk to some other guy who is obviously an attention whore and wants to invade my stream and take away from what im doing
[2017-05-07 23:53:59 UTC] biggershekel: Pod you going to prep the bull for destiny when he fucks his daughter?
[2017-05-07 23:54:01 UTC] ghandi101: hi phil
[2017-05-07 23:54:15 UTC] darksydephil: nobody here cares about this. if he wanted to talk to me, he could have emailed etc.
[2017-05-07 23:54:17 UTC] podusmonens: he has more viewers, no offense, he doesnt seek attention, he genuinely wants to talk
[2017-05-07 23:54:19 UTC] darksydephil: instead he wants attention
[2017-05-07 23:54:25 UTC] zahvone: Phil
[2017-05-07 23:54:29 UTC] darksydephil: so he can have attention on his own streams. this isn't finance talk lol

[2017-05-07 23:54:46 UTC] darksydephil: im not pissed?
[2017-05-07 23:54:47 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: DarksydePhil Destiny had no ill will at all towards you, he genuinely just wanted to talk to you about buying a new vs used car, because it's one of the things he likes to talk about.
[2017-05-07 23:54:56 UTC] daddi_boi: you seem pretty tilted
[2017-05-07 23:55:00 UTC] darksydephil: that's great darkandfullofterrors

[2017-05-07 23:55:07 UTC] pcgamehunter: Tell destiny TO USE EMAIL FailFish
[2017-05-07 23:55:12 UTC] darksydephil: i like to play games on my sterams
[2017-05-07 23:55:14 UTC] ghandi101: why during phil's stream though?
[2017-05-07 23:55:14 UTC] darksydephil: streams that is
[2017-05-07 23:55:18 UTC] pcgamehunter: If he wants to talk, he can do it in private emails
[2017-05-07 23:55:23 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: DarksydePhil Why not have a conversation where both of you benefits?
[2017-05-07 23:55:24 UTC] mxtt10589: @DarksydePhil What is your email?

[2017-05-07 23:55:30 UTC] zaitanz: @DarksydePhil as a far of neither of you. Destiny actually has sound advice regarding saving money on a car purchase.

[2017-05-07 23:55:55 UTC] bethebaby: Phil, man, you could've gone on stream with him and done like a collab podcast and gotten an insane traffic boost off of it.
[2017-05-07 23:55:56 UTC] podusmonens: you could do it in between streams. he is NOT a hater or anything like that
[2017-05-07 23:56:08 UTC] zilla_kami: ^^^
[2017-05-07 23:56:15 UTC] biggershekel: Phil he's a pedo stay away from him
[2017-05-07 23:56:17 UTC] ohuken: but does phil want non video game traffic?
[2017-05-07 23:56:18 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: DarksydePhil Clearly you like to do more than to play games on your streams. You have tons of alternative stuff like the hate live podcast, etc. You don't have to drop the game and talk to him straight away, it could be whenever you're free.
[2017-05-07 23:56:21 UTC] yacherdy: hatelive with destiny?
[2017-05-07 23:56:23 UTC] zahvone: He COULD have, but he's playing a game. It's a game stream -
[2017-05-07 23:56:25 UTC] darksydephil: thats great. i have advice on how to play super street fighter II turbo. but i dont invade other peoples streams and have my viewers spam their chat with nonsense unrelated to what they're doing to offer that advice
[2017-05-07 23:56:27 UTC] bethebaby: Plus when his viewers came in the view count freaking doubled to over 1,000.
[2017-05-07 23:56:36 UTC] duderito2: Well said Phil you have him well sussed. If he was genuine he wouldn't have his dickriders come into the chat and spam it.
[2017-05-07 23:56:38 UTC] soulrider95: Car advice is a bit more useful than Street Fighter
[2017-05-07 23:56:43 UTC] pcgamehunter: We actually are too lazy to raids other Phil lol :P
[2017-05-07 23:56:52 UTC] podusmonens: people who cam ehere fromd estiny's chat were respectful. some of them even cheered
[2017-05-07 23:56:54 UTC] pcgamehunter: But I get what you're saying
[2017-05-07 23:56:57 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: If Phil starts collaborating with Destinee, the alt-right backlash will be severe
[2017-05-07 23:57:10 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: He needs to stay away from that guy
[2017-05-07 23:57:10 UTC] podusmonens: they purpose was just to ask, not to disrupt the stream
[2017-05-07 23:57:10 UTC] zahvone: If phil starts to collab with people, it should be fans first, I think.
[2017-05-07 23:57:10 UTC] areyoushivering: i like how phil stood his ground, hes not a push-over
[2017-05-07 23:57:11 UTC] zilla_kami: business oppurtunity imo
[2017-05-07 23:57:11 UTC] mxtt10589: @DarksydePhil can you provide info on what your email is?
[2017-05-07 23:57:14 UTC] podusmonens: their&
[2017-05-07 23:57:29 UTC] yacherdy: EleGiggle
[2017-05-07 23:57:29 UTC] leandrus94: Bugged Business Mechanics
[2017-05-07 23:57:35 UTC] darksydephil: my email has always been darksydephil@hotmail.com
[2017-05-07 23:57:36 UTC] podusmonens: as far as I can see it did not hurt the stream. it brought more viewers actually
[2017-05-07 23:57:38 UTC] pcgamehunter: Oh boy the opinion swamp is here, FailFish
[2017-05-07 23:57:42 UTC] biggershekel: Phil don't do it he wants to send you nudes of his daughter
[2017-05-07 23:57:55 UTC] zaitanz: @DarksydePhil Perhaps you shouldn't put your financial issues into the public forum then? Perhaps keep it private if you don't want other people to discuss it/offer help
[2017-05-07 23:57:55 UTC] darksydephil: um, it filled the stream with spammers and nobody who was here before the raid could talk. it's quite rude
[2017-05-07 23:57:56 UTC] zahvone: @Biggershekel Please don't make jokes like that.
[2017-05-07 23:57:58 UTC] ohuken: it did hurt the stream cause it took awa from the game
[2017-05-07 23:58:19 UTC] bethebaby: We weren't even talking about the game lol
[2017-05-07 23:58:24 UTC] yacherdy: *sips craft beer*
[2017-05-07 23:58:25 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: DarksydePhil Streamers and their audiences interacting with each other has kind of become the norm, and isn't really considered bad mannered or anything. And as I mentioned, both of you would benefit from a conversation, I dont see why you wouldnt talk with him, he's clearly not in it to hurt you.
[2017-05-07 23:58:26 UTC] biggershekel: It's not a joke. The man is on record saying incest with his daughter is a good idea
[2017-05-07 23:58:27 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @Ohuken nobody in the stream chat was paying attention to the game anyway
[2017-05-07 23:58:28 UTC] soulrider95: Nobody was talking about the game LUL
[2017-05-07 23:58:45 UTC] zahvone: @Biggershekel That's okay, but that's not information we need to know lol
[2017-05-07 23:58:47 UTC] areyoushivering: @DarksydePhil u ll get shit for this, but good on you, stand your ground
[2017-05-07 23:58:54 UTC] biggershekel: Phil just stay away. That man is an fbi raid waiting to happen
[2017-05-07 23:59:10 UTC] darksydephil: basically, from my perspective here's what I know about Destiny: 1. he tweeted me and caused my twitter to get spammed, so i blocked him. 2. he conducted a stream raid that spammed my stream chat. that's it. the guy should probably learn how to properly communicate like an adult without having me get spam bombed. then maybe i'll actually care if he wants to talk or not
[2017-05-07 23:59:13 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: Biggershekel ???
[2017-05-07 23:59:14 UTC] podusmonens: that's not true
[2017-05-07 23:59:14 UTC] waveow: fbi raid lmaoo
[2017-05-07 23:59:18 UTC] duderito2: Yeah I'm sure he only wanted to help Phil out. A certain group claim to do the same but the reality is different. I'm glad Phil didn't take the bait.
[2017-05-07 23:59:30 UTC] soulrider95: No need to be so rude lmao
[2017-05-07 23:59:42 UTC] zaitanz: @DarksydePhil so close minded. "He didn't approach me the way I wanted, so I'll ignore him"
[2017-05-07 23:59:46 UTC] zahvone: Anyway, guys - the streams over so let's all Philter out. Kappa
[2017-05-07 23:59:51 UTC] daddi_boi: he was trying to help lul
[2017-05-07 23:59:51 UTC] mxtt10589: @soulrider95 that's not rude, that's what happened
[2017-05-07 23:59:57 UTC] podusmonens: he just wanted to get your attention in a more direct manner, he typed directly in chat and he also cheered
