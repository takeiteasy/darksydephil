[2017-05-21 21:58:15 UTC] pcgamehunter: The translation really fails anytime there is a english/japanese discrepency in the game and dub :/
[2017-05-21 21:58:32 UTC] kushiyakitori: those still aren't running out of the same thing lol
[2017-05-21 21:58:50 UTC] mizorelover: It's just a couple more days of plot progression @DarksydePhil You can make it!

[2017-05-21 22:00:01 UTC] kushiyakitori: none of the parts are the same. they could make the box bigger but no game designer would seriously make a single screen change for something minor
[2017-05-21 22:00:03 UTC] garlicshrimp: mustve tried to translate that shit word for word then

[2017-05-21 22:15:25 UTC] pcgamehunter: @DarksydePhil I think it's not law based, it's probably just that it's looked down upon socially
[2017-05-21 22:15:33 UTC] cz75lover: not everywhere in America either. In Texas, a 16 year old can get married with parental permission
[2017-05-21 22:15:40 UTC] jaxunhero: @darksydephil 16 I believe

[2017-05-21 22:26:57 UTC] pcgamehunter: Also Japan splits how you can be prosecuted for crimes for relationships and sex with anyone under 20. So for example, if a minor spends time with someone older in a hotel without the parents permission the parents can prosecute that person.
[2017-05-21 22:27:03 UTC] cz75lover: how the hell is the plant still healthy after so many days
