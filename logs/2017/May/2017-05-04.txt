[2017-05-04 01:44:48 UTC] deep_drive: Good news is you should probably be able to finish the game in 2 more streams
[2017-05-04 01:45:30 UTC] darksydephil: yeah i saw a tweet saying there's only 3-4 hours left
[2017-05-04 01:45:33 UTC] darksydephil: thats great news

[2017-05-04 01:54:27 UTC] darksydephil: got some minor bad news tonight for everyone
[2017-05-04 01:54:31 UTC] deep_drive: uh oh
[2017-05-04 01:54:34 UTC] thepastryarchy: :|
[2017-05-04 01:54:37 UTC] thebard55: What happend?
[2017-05-04 01:54:42 UTC] jwalker70: well fuck
[2017-05-04 01:54:46 UTC] thebard55: More youtube bullshit?
[2017-05-04 01:54:53 UTC] darksydephil: LootCrate numbers have been pretty bad w/referrals and the like, so they're putting my partnership on hold for a bit
[2017-05-04 01:54:59 UTC] blue_blur64: aw
[2017-05-04 01:55:06 UTC] darksydephil: i dont blame them, they send me like 3 crates a month now and almost nobody is really doing the referall stuff anymore
[2017-05-04 01:55:33 UTC] darksydephil: they said they want to start again in the summer perhaps and see if the stagger will get people interested again
[2017-05-04 01:55:40 UTC] jwalker70: that promotion doesn't really help you though
[2017-05-04 01:55:45 UTC] sanguinenite: yeah who would buy them unless they are brainless gamers?
[2017-05-04 01:55:59 UTC] jwalker70: i imagine you barley make much
[2017-05-04 01:56:09 UTC] darksydephil: i make like, maybe $50 every three months lol
[2017-05-04 01:56:13 UTC] megamannt125: Seems like Youtube is doomed to become a platform for big corporations and advertisers while the average joe is pushed aside, so much for YOUtube
[2017-05-04 01:56:15 UTC] deep_drive: That's too bad...
[2017-05-04 01:56:22 UTC] darksydephil: at first it was huge, because everyone was interested and signed up and then it just slowed down bigtime
[2017-05-04 01:56:29 UTC] thepastryarchy: Ahh okay. Well, it sucks for the pride, but at least it's not a blow to the bills.
[2017-05-04 01:56:37 UTC] echito: wow
[2017-05-04 01:56:46 UTC] megamannt125: Google has completely forgotten the purpose behind the website
[2017-05-04 01:56:47 UTC] coralguy: Phil sorry to hear about your stupid situation with YouTube man that sux, like working for free
[2017-05-04 01:56:48 UTC] darksydephil: yeah it won't have any real effect on me financially, but sucks as those unboxings were fun videos for the vlogging channel
[2017-05-04 01:56:53 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah megaman, they aren't even focused on helping viewers, they're busy making another new youtube design :P
[2017-05-04 01:57:12 UTC] blue_blur64: which admittedly from what I've used so far it is actually not terrible LUL
[2017-05-04 01:57:23 UTC] jwalker70: are you planning on giving away any of the stuff you got?
[2017-05-04 01:57:27 UTC] sanguinenite: No youtube is too busy bothered to ensure censorship to bother to fix their website for anyone
[2017-05-04 01:57:30 UTC] thepastryarchy: By the way, Phil, I just beat the last boss of the Nioh DLC. Even though I was level 205 and leveled my armor to 105+7, the boss still gave me hell, even with my beloved Suzaku
[2017-05-04 01:57:36 UTC] kekon3: Yo yo yo
[2017-05-04 01:57:41 UTC] thepastryarchy: So if you thought centepede hands was bad ... fuck.
[2017-05-04 01:57:51 UTC] darksydephil: delightful lol
[2017-05-04 01:58:03 UTC] megamannt125: Anyways I'm excited for this stream ,if you don't finish it tonight Phil it'll be next session unquestionably
[2017-05-04 01:58:05 UTC] coralguy: Hope your refreshed and hydrated phil
[2017-05-04 01:58:12 UTC] rinmathews: Hello everyone!
[2017-05-04 01:58:23 UTC] thepastryarchy: Yeeeehhh. But hell, fingers crossed that you get the Phil effect, where you beat super hard bosses very easily and vise versa!
[2017-05-04 01:58:28 UTC] bethebaby: BabyRage
[2017-05-04 01:58:34 UTC] jwalker70: phil you got 7 hours left not 4
[2017-05-04 01:58:37 UTC] coralguy: So true
[2017-05-04 01:58:43 UTC] marky117: dspFacepalm
[2017-05-04 01:58:47 UTC] megamannt125: Jwalker70 what are you talking about?
[2017-05-04 01:58:52 UTC] megamannt125: Did we play the same game?
[2017-05-04 01:58:52 UTC] rinmathews: No 4 hours sounds about right.
[2017-05-04 01:58:52 UTC] darksydephil: nobody seems to agree how much danganronpa is left lol
[2017-05-04 01:59:09 UTC] jayteabee: Phil!! How you doing man?
[2017-05-04 01:59:12 UTC] jwalker70: im citing a lets play
[2017-05-04 01:59:16 UTC] blue_blur64: Watch there be a hidden 3 hour segment in the game Kappa
[2017-05-04 01:59:32 UTC] megamannt125: Chapter 6 is one hour of investigation and 2 hours of trial, potential 4 hours total if he has trouble with some of the logic but 7???
[2017-05-04 01:59:58 UTC] darksydephil: im doing well thanks
[2017-05-04 02:00:03 UTC] deep_drive: lol i just heard theres around 4 hours. I've never actually played danganronpa
[2017-05-04 02:00:05 UTC] darksydephil: a bit hot in the office but cooling down as the sun is going down now
[2017-05-04 02:00:08 UTC] thepastryarchy: I'm gunna pick DiggityRampo2 up after this playthrough.
[2017-05-04 02:00:15 UTC] jwalker70: like i said i looked up a lp and counted the parts
[2017-05-04 02:00:17 UTC] megamannt125: A lot of lets plays include the optional school mode at the end of their LPs so that's probably why
[2017-05-04 02:00:19 UTC] xeranarth: Hey, Phil. So far, would you say it would be worth picking up 'ronpa at full price? Been waiting on a sale only for the Golden Week to burn me on it.
[2017-05-04 02:00:25 UTC] deep_drive: Do you have an air conditioner in there?
[2017-05-04 02:00:27 UTC] jayteabee: Yeah it's scorching in Cali, what's on the agenda??
[2017-05-04 02:00:27 UTC] blue_blur64: Well at least you have some heat Phil, it's supposed to drop into the 40s by the weekend here D:
[2017-05-04 02:00:39 UTC] darksydephil: Danganronpa is a 2 game collection on ps4 for i think 30 bucks? a great price IMO
[2017-05-04 02:00:39 UTC] deep_drive: ThePastryarchy how many bosses are there in the nioh dlc?
[2017-05-04 02:00:40 UTC] blue_blur64: in New York
[2017-05-04 02:00:45 UTC] megamannt125: 1-2 Reload comes with two great games for 40 bucks, definitely worth the price
[2017-05-04 02:00:45 UTC] thepastryarchy: There's three.
[2017-05-04 02:00:46 UTC] kekon3: My AC just broke and I'm in the equator in Texas.
[2017-05-04 02:01:00 UTC] megamannt125: if you buy them on steam it's more expensive
[2017-05-04 02:01:05 UTC] kekon3: AC just shooting hot air back at me
[2017-05-04 02:01:09 UTC] darksydephil: i haven't set up the air conditioner yet. trying to hold off as long as possible before i make a big jump in energy cost lol
[2017-05-04 02:01:12 UTC] deep_drive: that sucks Kekon3
[2017-05-04 02:01:20 UTC] blue_blur64: Also had to drive through flooded streets for the first time ever on Monday LUL
[2017-05-04 02:01:21 UTC] jwalker70: the school mode were separate parts
[2017-05-04 02:01:23 UTC] darksydephil: ok stream working well?
[2017-05-04 02:01:32 UTC] thepastryarchy: Wait wait, I'm sorry, four if you count that little weasel with the axe Phil one-shotted very slowly.

[2017-05-04 02:01:40 UTC] losnegro22: Sup Phil
[2017-05-04 02:01:44 UTC] kekon3: Stream looks and sounds nice
[2017-05-04 02:01:45 UTC] xeranarth: At least you guys got AC. When I was stuck in an apartment earlier this year, mine got smoked out and now I gotta buy a new one.
[2017-05-04 02:01:46 UTC] xeranarth: Fuck. Apartments.
[2017-05-04 02:01:51 UTC] bethebaby: @DarksydePhil Yeah stream's fine

[2017-05-04 02:02:05 UTC] deep_drive: Well the good news is that it was just hot today (i live in the portland metro area), its supposed to be below 70 for the rest of the week
[2017-05-04 02:02:10 UTC] sanguinenite: @Kekon3 you are right
[2017-05-04 02:02:10 UTC] deep_drive: probably same in seattle
[2017-05-04 02:02:26 UTC] coralguy: No ac needed here yet in little rhody
[2017-05-04 02:02:30 UTC] jwalker70: im going to replay persons and call myself killing you
[2017-05-04 02:02:33 UTC] blue_blur64: If only Phil had the Persona 5 PS4 theme on right now Kappa
[2017-05-04 02:02:34 UTC] kekon3: Seattle sounds fun this time of year
[2017-05-04 02:02:45 UTC] jwalker70: "I'm killing you"
[2017-05-04 02:02:49 UTC] thepastryarchy: As someone who lived in Seattle for many years, go during the summer.
[2017-05-04 02:02:55 UTC] blue_blur64: Stop bragging about your heat guys D:
[2017-05-04 02:03:08 UTC] jwalker70: I'm in heat
[2017-05-04 02:03:10 UTC] kekon3: It would need to be the "MC" or "Makoto" theme, Morgana and Ryuji themes are the daily life themes
[2017-05-04 02:03:14 UTC] deep_drive: which theme silent? the life will change one??
[2017-05-04 02:03:19 UTC] bethebaby: @jwalker70 WutFace

[2017-05-04 02:03:43 UTC] jayteabee: 👍
[2017-05-04 02:03:51 UTC] kekon3: MC and Makoto get "behind the mask" the nighttime song, for their theme song
[2017-05-04 02:03:52 UTC] blue_blur64: Ryuji was from a one day apology giveaway for delaying the game to April 4th
[2017-05-04 02:03:52 UTC] fatalbacura: woooo
[2017-05-04 02:04:22 UTC] jayteabee: Yeeeessss! Phil is here!

[2017-05-04 02:04:55 UTC] megamannt125: Sucks Phil didn't get to see the Alternate Ending
[2017-05-04 02:05:07 UTC] kekon3: So apparently if you pursued the lie it leads to the bad ending
[2017-05-04 02:05:11 UTC] jayteabee: ???
[2017-05-04 02:05:22 UTC] megamannt125: Yeah, but it's not really an ending, it just restarts back at the decision
[2017-05-04 02:05:37 UTC] jayteabee: Ohhh okay
[2017-05-04 02:05:47 UTC] jwalker70: i predict monokuma cheated because makoto was about to say something bad for him.
[2017-05-04 02:06:01 UTC] dspfandood: except prey
[2017-05-04 02:06:02 UTC] jwalker70: unless it really was makoto
[2017-05-04 02:06:05 UTC] dspfandood: dspHmm
[2017-05-04 02:06:18 UTC] deathballer250: CAM!
[2017-05-04 02:06:21 UTC] jayteabee: Did you guys see the Darksiders trailer?
[2017-05-04 02:06:24 UTC] megamannt125: If you pursued Kyoko's lie, she gets executed and Alter Ego isn't there to save her
[2017-05-04 02:06:34 UTC] dspfandood: is phil playing persona 5 tomorrow?
[2017-05-04 02:06:39 UTC] kekon3: Is prey on Friday?
[2017-05-04 02:06:43 UTC] jwalker70: so its a bad ending?
[2017-05-04 02:06:47 UTC] megamannt125: Yeah
[2017-05-04 02:06:55 UTC] kekon3: Didn't kno it came out on friday
[2017-05-04 02:06:56 UTC] megamannt125: They never solve the mystery of the school and decide to live there forever
[2017-05-04 02:06:56 UTC] deep_drive: thats sad Megamannt125 i like kyoko so far
[2017-05-04 02:06:59 UTC] coralguy: Go with a Delorian phil
[2017-05-04 02:07:00 UTC] jayteabee: He should go back in a save to show it off XD
[2017-05-04 02:07:00 UTC] megamannt125: and everyone has babies with Hina
[2017-05-04 02:07:02 UTC] cheesypickles: No 24 hr car dealership?
[2017-05-04 02:07:09 UTC] deep_drive: dspHmm
[2017-05-04 02:07:16 UTC] jayteabee: Rip Friday :(
[2017-05-04 02:07:18 UTC] jwalker70: so does that mean monokuma doesn't know who the culprit is?
[2017-05-04 02:07:27 UTC] cheesypickles: Brand new car hype
[2017-05-04 02:07:31 UTC] gamerzinvt: hina actually gets gangbanged
[2017-05-04 02:07:32 UTC] megamannt125: Who knows watch the stream and find out :P
[2017-05-04 02:07:33 UTC] kekon3: There probably is but he's talking to someone else then the 24 hour dealership
[2017-05-04 02:07:41 UTC] brandeno3: Look at me everyone I'm DSP
[2017-05-04 02:07:43 UTC] deathballer250: cant he just call you?
[2017-05-04 02:07:45 UTC] deep_drive: i think you were watching the hentai dood
[2017-05-04 02:07:46 UTC] akioartorius: @Megamannt125 which would prove Hiro's forture prediction right
[2017-05-04 02:07:50 UTC] jwalker70: im just thinking aloud
[2017-05-04 02:07:51 UTC] deathballer250: Seems like simple math
[2017-05-04 02:07:56 UTC] blue_blur64: no you aren't brandeno3 Kappa
[2017-05-04 02:07:57 UTC] dspfandood: SwiftRage buy my fucking car

[2017-05-04 02:08:51 UTC] jayteabee: I would tip but I'm jobless and need to save for a car XD
[2017-05-04 02:08:55 UTC] coralguy: Hash it out hype
[2017-05-04 02:08:56 UTC] thepastryarchy: "Whappity-pow" was a reference to that god awful "Revolution 60" game he played during the bad games marathon. It's too hilarious.
[2017-05-04 02:09:01 UTC] deathballer250: Add blocker ftw
[2017-05-04 02:09:02 UTC] dspfandood: KOgaming ResidentSleeper

[2017-05-04 02:10:02 UTC] kekon3: Oh right the new free games are out for plus
[2017-05-04 02:10:30 UTC] sanguinenite: revo 60 wasnt even a game
[2017-05-04 02:10:39 UTC] deep_drive: revo 60 was first a mobile game

[2017-05-04 02:12:20 UTC] cnkxx: The most violent and dark kids game
[2017-05-04 02:12:21 UTC] kekon3: Is it a kids game? I think it's more of a young adult fiction game
[2017-05-04 02:12:23 UTC] breaktheglass: @deathballer250 they all are kids games
[2017-05-04 02:12:44 UTC] rinmathews: @ThePastryarchy I watched Lord of the Rings when i was 5. Most kids know what death is
[2017-05-04 02:12:44 UTC] megamannt125: It's definitely not a kids game, but the beta version was way more fucked up and darker

[2017-05-04 17:31:35 UTC] betheallen: cause youtube messed up
[2017-05-04 17:31:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh nice good news
[2017-05-04 17:31:43 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey AscensionShock
[2017-05-04 17:32:01 UTC] ascensionshock: That new MCN is a scam.
[2017-05-04 17:32:29 UTC] ascensionshock: He is going to regret it very badly if he doesn't look into it.
[2017-05-04 17:32:43 UTC] ascensionshock: That's his business on the line here.
[2017-05-04 17:32:54 UTC] betheallen: youtube woke phil up at 4am to tell him the bad news, then jelsea helped him and he wrote a e-mail to youtube a BAD one :D
[2017-05-04 17:33:01 UTC] theycallmejimbob: People were getting deleted yesterday for saying that AscensionShock I think he knows peoples concerns about it
[2017-05-04 17:33:26 UTC] betheallen: deleted? when was this
[2017-05-04 17:33:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yesterday after you left bethe
[2017-05-04 17:33:54 UTC] ascensionshock: He was mocking the people who were concerned for him. The mods were banning people left and right for pointing it out.
[2017-05-04 17:34:10 UTC] ascensionshock: He should be the one concerned, not his fans.
[2017-05-04 17:34:16 UTC] betheallen: jimbob but there was only half hour left of stream
[2017-05-04 17:35:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Maybe you were there bethe he was saying he didn't want drama in the chat and the people that continued to bring it up got deleted
[2017-05-04 17:35:28 UTC] betheallen: wait phil mocked his fans who were worried he would be DELETED by youtube? i bet vidar was the mod here cause i dont think pops would ban anyone
[2017-05-04 17:35:29 UTC] ascensionshock: He said he was going to send a "nasty" email to YouTube after he just found a loophole to link the Adsense from KOGaming to DSPGaming? That's stupid in my opinion.
[2017-05-04 17:35:49 UTC] betheallen: jimbob i didnt here it
[2017-05-04 17:36:20 UTC] ascensionshock: I am positive we all know who perma bans the most here.
[2017-05-04 17:36:47 UTC] betheallen: phil does perma ban a lot
[2017-05-04 17:36:53 UTC] betheallen: but its not only him
[2017-05-04 17:37:46 UTC] betheallen: pops says he only timeout people except obvious trolls
[2017-05-04 17:37:50 UTC] ascensionshock: Phil was calling them crybabies for pointing out that his new MCN is shady and probably a scam.
[2017-05-04 17:38:32 UTC] betheallen: that is different then
[2017-05-04 17:38:47 UTC] ascensionshock: He says he doesn't want drama, but he only fueled the fire.
[2017-05-04 17:39:07 UTC] betheallen: mmhmm
[2017-05-04 17:39:36 UTC] ascensionshock: Him giving dating advice was cringy as fuck.

[2017-05-04 17:41:17 UTC] ascensionshock: The question was: What do you think of guys who ask random girls for their numbers so they can have sex with them.
[2017-05-04 17:41:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh sorry my bad
[2017-05-04 17:41:38 UTC] ascensionshock: He said the same generic answer that I heard before.

[2017-05-04 17:43:52 UTC] ascensionshock: It was someone anonymous who sent a dollar with the question.
[2017-05-04 17:44:26 UTC] jwalker70: the one where he first revealed his face and the one where he got laid off
[2017-05-04 17:44:37 UTC] jwalker70: lots happened since then
[2017-05-04 17:44:48 UTC] ascensionshock: Although, it doesn't really matter because you are still anonymous since you can change your name to whatever you wish.
[2017-05-04 17:46:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: back to Persona today?
[2017-05-04 17:46:20 UTC] ascensionshock: However, the streamer will be able to see the email from which the money came from.

[2017-05-04 17:49:12 UTC] jwalker70: its just a fighting game
[2017-05-04 17:49:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Maybe cause it's his first time playing a fighting game since he returned to twitch
[2017-05-04 17:49:58 UTC] ascensionshock: Remember he played the beta also.

[2017-05-04 17:58:52 UTC] ascensionshock: Then someone sent him a tip to let him know about the echo.
[2017-05-04 17:58:53 UTC] jwalker70: for me it was more when he spent a minute explaining it
[2017-05-04 17:59:01 UTC] yacherdy: and someone messaged Leanna aswell

[2017-05-04 18:01:17 UTC] yacherdy: yes
[2017-05-04 18:01:31 UTC] ascensionshock: Then Phil insulted him back in the stream chat and stopped hosting him.
[2017-05-04 18:01:52 UTC] yacherdy: the thing is that guy was insulting him weeks ago
[2017-05-04 18:01:57 UTC] ascensionshock: You didn't know Zelda is Dark Souls copycat Kappa

[2017-05-04 18:18:08 UTC] bethebaby: I checked out their site and it just looks so...basic.
[2017-05-04 18:18:12 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: i looked it up @sanguinenite
[2017-05-04 18:18:13 UTC] errnoent: this guy's too damn loud
[2017-05-04 18:18:17 UTC] sanguinenite: So did I
[2017-05-04 18:18:21 UTC] theycallmejimbob: delta people got deleted yesterday for saying that come back from the edge man NotLikeThis
[2017-05-04 18:18:23 UTC] sanguinenite: The site looks basic enough
[2017-05-04 18:18:29 UTC] yacherdy: well rip delta
[2017-05-04 18:18:33 UTC] yacherdy: luv u brah
[2017-05-04 18:18:41 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: cahman cherdy :(
[2017-05-04 18:18:41 UTC] sanguinenite: but unless you have other youtubers coming out and saying shit about the company you have no proof
[2017-05-04 18:18:53 UTC] yacherdy: well just in preparation delta
[2017-05-04 18:18:58 UTC] bethebaby: @theycallmejimbob Which is ricidulous because if it IS as shady as it is then we're trying to help Phil.
[2017-05-04 18:18:58 UTC] errnoent: god this guy is fucking annoying
[2017-05-04 18:19:00 UTC] cherry_dood: But like, what exactly could they scam him out of?
[2017-05-04 18:19:01 UTC] rpgasm34: rekt
[2017-05-04 18:19:10 UTC] errnoent: it's total silence or talking loud af
[2017-05-04 18:19:14 UTC] darksydephil: can you guys do me a favor?
[2017-05-04 18:19:19 UTC] cherry_dood: Like steal his content or copyright or something? I'm confused.
[2017-05-04 18:19:19 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Freaking Bloodbourne
[2017-05-04 18:19:21 UTC] errnoent: sup phil
[2017-05-04 18:19:25 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I just can't do that game
[2017-05-04 18:19:26 UTC] darksydephil: unless you have definitive proof of wrongdoing, stop spreading rumors like little girls
[2017-05-04 18:19:32 UTC] yacherdy: EleGiggle
[2017-05-04 18:19:35 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I prefer Dark Souls 3
[2017-05-04 18:19:44 UTC] errnoent: what? someone spread rumors?
[2017-05-04 18:19:44 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Bloodbourne I just can't sit down and play
[2017-05-04 18:19:45 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: have you seen my suggestion darksydephil on a patron event ?
[2017-05-04 18:19:53 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I agree, unless they have proof, they dont have shit on the current MCN
[2017-05-04 18:20:11 UTC] cherry_dood: I'm just trying to figure out what kind of "scam" anyone would run. Doesn't make sense to me.
[2017-05-04 18:20:14 UTC] darksydephil: the problem is, people LOVE to create drama where it doesn't exist
[2017-05-04 18:20:19 UTC] theultimatedespair: Why would you join an MCN with less than 100 members? That seems AWFULLY fishy dude. Their own website isn't even up and running fully and they've been around for 2 years!
[2017-05-04 18:20:20 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I'm at the point at DS3 I can't do anything either except soul farm the three winged guardians near the twin princes
[2017-05-04 18:20:22 UTC] sanguinenite: Honestly, I think @TheNewFaceofCreation is a troll
[2017-05-04 18:20:32 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Since all the twin princes do is destroy me
[2017-05-04 18:20:32 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: im not
[2017-05-04 18:20:37 UTC] errnoent: What IS Phil's MCN now? I can look into it
[2017-05-04 18:20:42 UTC] sanguinenite: I will let the mods decide
[2017-05-04 18:20:43 UTC] cherry_dood: If it's a startup, then it is what it is. Gotta start somewhere, no?
[2017-05-04 18:20:47 UTC] theultimatedespair: Laveria Media is his new MCN
[2017-05-04 18:21:00 UTC] darksydephil: let me say this
[2017-05-04 18:21:04 UTC] cherry_dood: @TheNewFaceofCreation is fine. Quality chatter.
[2017-05-04 18:21:14 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: thanks :)
[2017-05-04 18:21:26 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But yeah, if you guys play DS3 and don't know, best way to farm, is outside the Twin Princes. Use Rapport on the golden winged guardians and watch them fight
[2017-05-04 18:21:29 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Tons of souls
[2017-05-04 18:21:31 UTC] darksydephil: how do you think the MCN feels when it's trying to recruit YouTubers, they sign me, and in the first day you've got a bunch of dumb people saying they're a scam??? You're hurting both me and the MCN by spreading rumors without proof. so STFU
[2017-05-04 18:21:32 UTC] cherry_dood: There's some douchenozzles in here. You aren't one of them.
[2017-05-04 18:21:36 UTC] mythstorm24: Quality pre pre stream chat banter
[2017-05-04 18:21:42 UTC] bethebaby: The real drama is when chatters go on their stupid witch hunts, trying to oust people as trolls and SoKs.
[2017-05-04 18:21:51 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Also use a Silver Covetus ring, symbol of avarice and Shield of Want
[2017-05-04 18:21:59 UTC] sanguinenite: Trolls will believe anything they want to believe lol
[2017-05-04 18:21:59 UTC] darksydephil: okay
[2017-05-04 18:22:02 UTC] darksydephil: setting up the stream now
[2017-05-04 18:22:04 UTC] cherry_dood: What @bethebaby said!

[2017-05-04 18:22:06 UTC] yacherdy: TriHard
[2017-05-04 18:22:19 UTC] yacherdy: Dramamine
[2017-05-04 18:22:23 UTC] theultimatedespair: When the mcn itself can't even properly fix their carrers page on their own website for 2 years, there is a problem lol
[2017-05-04 18:22:24 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: have you seen my email on the patron event suggestion darksydephil ?
[2017-05-04 18:22:27 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I personally have two of them so I hit rapport on them and switch to dual Shield of wants with the silver ring and symbol of Avarice
[2017-05-04 18:22:32 UTC] cherry_dood: WAY too much paranoia in here sometimes.
[2017-05-04 18:22:40 UTC] yacherdy: Paranoid Androids

[2017-05-04 18:22:44 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Thats all I can do at this moment
[2017-05-04 18:22:45 UTC] ascensionshock: @DarksydePhil Did you even sign a contract with them?
[2017-05-04 18:23:09 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The Twin Princes are my personal archnemesis
[2017-05-04 18:23:10 UTC] darksydephil: by the way
[2017-05-04 18:23:19 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: have you seen my email on the patron event suggestion darksydephil ?
[2017-05-04 18:23:21 UTC] darksydephil: it's confirmed that youtube is demonetizing videos by keywords. as stupid as that sounds
[2017-05-04 18:23:28 UTC] yacherdy: hmmm
[2017-05-04 18:23:38 UTC] darksydephil: one of my vids of Sunset Overdrive is titled Deep Throat. got demonetized lol
[2017-05-04 18:23:38 UTC] cherry_dood: Good old YT
[2017-05-04 18:23:40 UTC] errnoent: Laveria Media is not wise enough to use a whois protection service, I will not reveal the registrant's name but I'd say it's a legitimate company
[2017-05-04 18:23:48 UTC] yacherdy: PogChamp
[2017-05-04 18:23:49 UTC] errnoent: If they're truly scammers then they are DAMN stupid ones
[2017-05-04 18:23:51 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I always need help with them
[2017-05-04 18:23:58 UTC] sanguinenite: Not surprised
[2017-05-04 18:24:06 UTC] bethebaby: @DarksydePhil Now THAT is some shit.

[2017-05-04 18:24:19 UTC] yacherdy: uh oh
[2017-05-04 18:24:21 UTC] theultimatedespair: Sunset Overdrive was a shit game anyway lol
[2017-05-04 18:24:25 UTC] jwalker70: thats so stupid
[2017-05-04 18:24:40 UTC] jwalker70: deep throat?
[2017-05-04 18:24:47 UTC] darksydephil: yup
[2017-05-04 18:24:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Do Youtube just demonetize a video now if it has a risque title irrespective of the content?
[2017-05-04 18:24:56 UTC] darksydephil: one video in my Mafia III playthrough has KKK in the title, because i'm fighting the KKK
[2017-05-04 18:24:58 UTC] darksydephil: demonetized!
[2017-05-04 18:25:06 UTC] darksydephil: yes theycallmejimbob
[2017-05-04 18:25:08 UTC] darksydephil: that's exactly correct
[2017-05-04 18:25:11 UTC] ascensionshock: @DarksydePhil Why do you disagree with that?
[2017-05-04 18:25:14 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: why ignoring me :( ?
[2017-05-04 18:25:25 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: what did i did to you phil?
[2017-05-04 18:25:27 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: :(
[2017-05-04 18:25:32 UTC] sanguinenite: yeah all the truther channels are saying Youtube is being turned into a safe space
[2017-05-04 18:25:32 UTC] cherry_dood: LOL. So people who search for KKK are going to get a video game playthrough of Mafia 3?
[2017-05-04 18:25:38 UTC] errnoent: Yeah looks like they're a startup of college kids, very very young leadership
[2017-05-04 18:26:12 UTC] sanguinenite: Anything remotely controversial will be flagged, even if it is just gaming, which is just stupid
[2017-05-04 18:26:30 UTC] darksydephil: yes
[2017-05-04 18:26:35 UTC] bethebaby: So I could potentially have a video about shooting guns, put "deep penetration" in the title, and it wouldn't be eligible for monetization. Sounds like a weak system that just arbitrarily picks and chooses... Kind of like Youtube in general :D
[2017-05-04 18:26:43 UTC] theultimatedespair: no
[2017-05-04 18:26:46 UTC] darksydephil: call of duty youtubers are trying to cover COD WWII and all of their videos are getting demonetized. they're going out of business
[2017-05-04 18:26:49 UTC] theultimatedespair: you would get demonitized for having guns
[2017-05-04 18:27:00 UTC] theultimatedespair: in the video
[2017-05-04 18:27:04 UTC] bethebaby: @TheUltimateDespair Well I'd believe that too.
[2017-05-04 18:27:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Seriously, I can fight almost anything in Dark Souls 3 but The Twin Princes are my weakness. I think if I can beat them just once by myself I will break some mental wall down that is keeping me from beating them
[2017-05-04 18:27:23 UTC] darksydephil: its not because of the violence, its because it has WWII in teh title and youtube's NEW algorithm deems world war ii as advertiser unfriendly lol
[2017-05-04 18:27:25 UTC] ascensionshock: @DarksydePhil Is that actually true?
[2017-05-04 18:27:31 UTC] errnoent: jesus this guy is annoying

[2017-05-04 18:27:56 UTC] yacherdy: jeez
[2017-05-04 18:27:57 UTC] sanguinenite: lol they are so terrified by the truth channels that youtube had to sabotage everyone else, including you Phil. XD I am laughing at the retardness of Google
[2017-05-04 18:27:59 UTC] podusmonens: do you think youtube is trying to move to live TV Phil? they've been doing that lately

[2017-05-04 18:28:32 UTC] darksydephil: AscensionShock the article is based on facts from big COD youtubers. are you stupid?
[2017-05-04 18:28:39 UTC] bethebaby: I don't get Youtube. They're just so...inefficient.

[2017-05-04 19:53:19 UTC] howlingwolfjoey: mercilus is just a harder version of hard

[2017-05-04 19:53:57 UTC] pcgamehunter: Merciless gives less money and xp ? @Vlayer
[2017-05-04 19:53:59 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter he let ann stay dead and beat the boss so she lost exp. and he didnt check for enemy weakness at all

[2017-05-04 19:58:22 UTC] vince329: who knows, maybe with Persona 6 they'll start going back to the more darker storylines that P1 and P2 had. P5 was heading towards that direction so maybe that'll be a clear indication
[2017-05-04 19:58:27 UTC] d1rgeflame: seriously, its like Atlus is saying "we don't like money"

[2017-05-04 22:05:09 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @conky89, For me, it's the combat system. It's just too slow for me; it's why I've never been a fan of turn based.

[2017-05-04 22:06:46 UTC] deep_drive: It's the NWO delta
[2017-05-04 22:06:51 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @LemonPlaysGames I recommend trying Resonance of Fate. Its turn based, but just watching the gameplay of it I think will make you be interested due to the fact that despite being turned based you are still having to do actions during the move during your turn. It actually can stop being turn based if you get the right attack pattern on an enemy too
[2017-05-04 22:06:52 UTC] darthvidarviking: @shadowking194 @chairmanmeow1988 dspAngrydsp
[2017-05-04 22:06:57 UTC] conky89: yeah. Weaboo are people who are obsessed with japanese culture to be point they think they are japanese

[2017-05-04 22:07:23 UTC] euffy: Resonance of Fate has an awesome battle system and a ton of customization.
[2017-05-04 22:07:44 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @phoenixrising2015, Ah, so sort of like FF7's system then where you can't wait too long? I'll look into it.
[2017-05-04 22:07:48 UTC] damienelmaskador: Find another route
[2017-05-04 22:07:58 UTC] lvlpower: @darksydephil crawl

[2017-05-04 22:08:21 UTC] lvlpower: watch your step
[2017-05-04 22:08:34 UTC] pcgamehunter: @DarksydePhil So to save your time here. Remember in binary 0 means off 1 means on.
[2017-05-04 22:08:34 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @LemonPlaysGames Basically, its a John Woo game in Turn based mode, but if you set up the enemy just right, all the turn based stuff goes away and it becomes kind of like an all out assault game
[2017-05-04 22:08:46 UTC] chairmanmeow1988: please don't talk about your sweaty crotch...
[2017-05-04 22:09:21 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @phoenixrising2015, Gotcha. SOunds cool, thanks :)
