[2017-05-30 21:59:10 UTC] imlycku: @eazel Lots of people view him just because people do this to him. If he learned to laugh at himself and stayed in chat, more people would stay and watch. Easy way to grow an audience, he just can't laugh at himself and thats his biggest flaw.

[2017-05-30 22:41:04 UTC] furiouskirk6: Phil why dont you just mute the people seperately
[2017-05-30 22:41:06 UTC] pcgamehunter: You troll the trolls without any logical consistency even they'll get mad Kappa
[2017-05-30 22:41:06 UTC] lewismufc96: if they joiined, you just go to the player who is speaking and mute. Problem = solved.
[2017-05-30 22:41:08 UTC] jl_volken: Loud running again
[2017-05-30 22:41:12 UTC] radicalenzyme: they cannot talk if they join mid game

[2017-05-30 22:41:29 UTC] midnight_strike_force: Like, it's not very good to insinuate that potentially everybody who doesn't join *all* of the streams is up to something.
[2017-05-30 22:41:31 UTC] goldencolts: its like playing "The Ship" without any kind of chat
[2017-05-30 22:41:37 UTC] goldencolts: it ruins the whole funness
[2017-05-30 22:41:38 UTC] furiouskirk6: if they join mid game they are spectators

[2017-05-30 22:43:49 UTC] forwardarro: only players in the game can troll during game
[2017-05-30 22:43:52 UTC] roscoesplaysuit: @midnight_strike_force Sadly it happens, I'd rather Phil go private chat than flipping out and giving birth to 20 stupid videos
[2017-05-30 22:44:02 UTC] dooley258: I don't think the chat was so useful in game in the first place
[2017-05-30 22:44:03 UTC] zanzonyx: Game seems fun, but only for like....2-3 hours max
[2017-05-30 22:44:08 UTC] podusmonens: @YaSlothy wanna bang peter pan?

[2017-05-30 23:06:37 UTC] micgelo09: dead by daylight is where you choose a killer (basically jason but each abilities are diffrent ) as a survivor your goal is to rev up the generators to open a gate and escape
[2017-05-30 23:06:40 UTC] vanillabear111: dbd is better, by FAR

[2017-05-30 23:07:33 UTC] dark_jai: as TB said, "DBD is a piece of shit"
[2017-05-30 23:07:41 UTC] crimsonstriker55: It's also extremely easy for any team of survivors to run circles around any killer making the survival a joke.
[2017-05-30 23:07:41 UTC] hyperior21: There should be an option to demo the game before you buy it
[2017-05-30 23:07:44 UTC] echito: yea

[2017-05-30 23:08:07 UTC] roubador: @DarksydePhil Dead by Daylight uses peer to peer connections making it pretty inconsistent
[2017-05-30 23:08:07 UTC] micgelo09: is phil done with mafia 3 and if so could he at least say he's not doing a playthrough of the story dlc's? because two dlc's have already releaed
