[2017-05-14 22:32:54 UTC] blue_blur64: Ok, I'm gonna open up youtube again and see if my laptop freaks out about it
[2017-05-14 22:33:00 UTC] iconicmaster1: Megan rain actually did a parody of Rita for brazzer
[2017-05-14 22:33:05 UTC] lvlpower: can phil handle that kind of responsibility
[2017-05-14 22:33:06 UTC] hyperior21: @daddi_boi You piece of shit assholes always slander him and take everything he says out of context. Meanwhile, you always blindly believe everything the SOK's says
[2017-05-14 22:33:12 UTC] mxtt10589: it would affect his usual streaming time so he would probably at least mention something
[2017-05-14 22:33:16 UTC] kovorus: Well he kept the engagement thing a secret
[2017-05-14 22:33:24 UTC] darthvidarviking: the thing is I thought his family lived in CT but it seamed for some reason it was something that went on where he is now
[2017-05-14 22:33:26 UTC] stevensonbilista: @dukaduka je connais. mais je vais rester
[2017-05-14 22:33:33 UTC] daddi_boi: @Hyperior21 easy with the insults there bub
[2017-05-14 22:33:34 UTC] kingjezal: I can't stand slander. I have zero tolerance for it.
[2017-05-14 22:33:43 UTC] deadpylons: what did daddi_boi say ??
[2017-05-14 22:33:48 UTC] lvlpower: we all need to go and buy Selsun Blue
[2017-05-14 22:33:52 UTC] deadpylons: im so lost and curious at the same time
[2017-05-14 22:34:02 UTC] daddi_boi: @Deadpylons im mentally ill obvi
[2017-05-14 22:34:07 UTC] abegamers: daddi boi said phil would seem more transparent if he gave evidence for the things he was saying, that was all.
[2017-05-14 22:34:13 UTC] daddi_boi: yep
[2017-05-14 22:34:23 UTC] iconicmaster1: Nina Hartley Kreygasm
[2017-05-14 22:34:24 UTC] blue_blur64: Ok, so now Youtube isn't having a seizure on my laptop. So wtf happened before? O_o
[2017-05-14 22:34:53 UTC] kovorus: Nina Hartley is fucking disgusting
[2017-05-14 22:35:04 UTC] lvlpower: phil ended the broadcast
[2017-05-14 22:35:05 UTC] hyperior21: @Kovorus It's making light of a potentially serious situation. Whenever I have a family situation, it's always because a grandparent is ill.
[2017-05-14 22:35:07 UTC] deadpylons: that makes sense though.
[2017-05-14 22:35:11 UTC] iconicmaster1: EleGiggle
[2017-05-14 22:35:15 UTC] dukaduka: @stevensonbilista d'accord. Je suis desole, mon francais est mal.
[2017-05-14 22:35:19 UTC] hyperior21: @abegamers How
[2017-05-14 22:35:19 UTC] deadpylons: have evidence to back up your claim always helps
[2017-05-14 22:35:20 UTC] darthvidarviking: Who else have showed any evidence?
[2017-05-14 22:35:46 UTC] chowb321: did anyone hear the phone vibrate or anything?
[2017-05-14 22:35:47 UTC] kovorus: @Hyperior21 Either way he'll let us know later
[2017-05-14 22:35:57 UTC] apexhell117: he has it on vibrate
[2017-05-14 22:36:08 UTC] hyperior21: @darthvidarking Exactly! And them just saying "I contacted them and this is what they sai" isn't evidence.
[2017-05-14 22:36:23 UTC] chowb321: i guess we'll just wait and see
[2017-05-14 22:36:28 UTC] daddi_boi: the burden of proof was placed squarely on phil, and he didn't provide any
[2017-05-14 22:36:32 UTC] deadpylons: did he show anything during this stream
[2017-05-14 22:36:34 UTC] stevensonbilista: @dukaduka haha. no worries. sometimes i just prefer talking in my own tongue language
[2017-05-14 22:36:41 UTC] bbt_2017: SoK showed no evidence either just had people come on say they're laveria...Do we really know if they were?
[2017-05-14 22:36:48 UTC] darthvidarviking: Why not just trust what he is saying? do you honestly think he would fabricate a story? I Can't see why really
[2017-05-14 22:37:04 UTC] deadpylons: who is the sok?
[2017-05-14 22:37:04 UTC] daddi_boi: because phil has been caught in lies in the past, that's why
[2017-05-14 22:37:10 UTC] iconicmaster1: Ava Addams Kreygasm
[2017-05-14 22:37:14 UTC] abegamers: they have age old linkedin pages confirming that they were real but i dont really care for the hate vs fan war, i just am here to see phil
[2017-05-14 22:37:17 UTC] kingjezal: He would only lie for his own safety.
[2017-05-14 22:37:19 UTC] bbt_2017: He has nothing to gain by lying about Laveria. Facts
[2017-05-14 22:37:27 UTC] palehorse13: Phil? Lie? Never! KappaHD
[2017-05-14 22:37:27 UTC] thedarkchocolate: gianna michaels Kreygasm
[2017-05-14 22:37:29 UTC] daddi_boi: except his reputation
[2017-05-14 22:37:37 UTC] apexhell117: I hope everything is okay
[2017-05-14 22:37:41 UTC] darthvidarviking: I think you care to much and want to belice he is lying all the time
[2017-05-14 22:37:49 UTC] kingjezal: Phil's reputation is pretty steady as it is. No need to lie.
[2017-05-14 22:37:49 UTC] blue_blur64: Ok, I'm just going back to the other stream I was on
[2017-05-14 22:37:50 UTC] daddi_boi: no, i wanted some type of proof
[2017-05-14 22:37:51 UTC] hyperior21: @daddi_boi No the burden of proof is on those who accuse him of lying.
[2017-05-14 22:37:56 UTC] iconicmaster1: Joanna Angels Kreygasm
[2017-05-14 22:37:58 UTC] darthvidarviking: because that fits your warped veiw on phil
[2017-05-14 22:38:03 UTC] darthvidarviking: alright bye @blue_blur64
[2017-05-14 22:38:25 UTC] awbray1: @darthvidarviking there is loads on the internet where he has lied like when he got swatted it was just 2 cops who knocked on the door thats it wasnt dangerous at all like he said
[2017-05-14 22:38:34 UTC] mr_izumi: Ya
[2017-05-14 22:38:35 UTC] eltaco1234: scratching his leg
[2017-05-14 22:38:41 UTC] daddi_boi: project 7
[2017-05-14 22:38:44 UTC] chowb321: I'm interested in his side of the story. thats all
[2017-05-14 22:38:48 UTC] philtheboss2367: What happened
[2017-05-14 22:38:49 UTC] kingjezal: He only lies for his own safety. This is confirmed.
[2017-05-14 22:38:50 UTC] abegamers: I scratch my leg on a daily basis
[2017-05-14 22:38:59 UTC] philtheboss2367: I thought he was still streaming
[2017-05-14 22:39:03 UTC] eltaco1234: on cam
[2017-05-14 22:39:07 UTC] blue_blur64: He said it could have been dangerous if he didn't call the police about the potential swatting beforehand
[2017-05-14 22:39:07 UTC] mr_izumi: Emergency
[2017-05-14 22:39:11 UTC] abegamers: Phil‚ÄèVerified account @TheyCallMeDSP 1m1 minute agoMore Sorry folks for the abrupt end to the podcast stream, I have an emergency and have to leave. I'll update everyone later tonight.
[2017-05-14 22:39:11 UTC] deadpylons: I don't know much about DSP but I can say that from what I have seen, a ton more about him twisting statements and truths are more apparent than him give it to us straight
[2017-05-14 22:39:13 UTC] darthvidarviking: look at this shit haha it is just so ridiculous hahaa project7 police comming is not swatting.
[2017-05-14 22:39:36 UTC] daddi_boi: what's ridiculous about it exactly? you wanted to know why someone might not take phil's word at face value
[2017-05-14 22:39:39 UTC] palehorse13: Do you have an orgasm white scratching your leg?
[2017-05-14 22:39:40 UTC] lvlpower: I just thought of the worst situation
[2017-05-14 22:40:00 UTC] mr_izumi: Phil lies a lot
[2017-05-14 22:40:06 UTC] gxpopcorn69: TRU
[2017-05-14 22:40:06 UTC] philtheboss2367: Oh I hope everything is alright
[2017-05-14 22:40:06 UTC] iconicmaster1: Brandi love Kreygasm
[2017-05-14 22:40:14 UTC] kingjezal: There are women who orgasm just by being touched on a certain spot on their back.
[2017-05-14 22:40:18 UTC] lvlpower: but I should just keep my thoughts to myself because I know that there's other fans who are pre pre streaming this
[2017-05-14 22:40:18 UTC] darthvidarviking: Yes and I don't see the connection with some project 7 and police coming to visit
[2017-05-14 22:40:19 UTC] abegamers: I'm of the opinion too that I was here to see phil's side of the story
[2017-05-14 22:40:24 UTC] awbray1: this network has just come out of the blue
[2017-05-14 22:40:26 UTC] daddi_boi: dear god
[2017-05-14 22:40:31 UTC] abegamers: don't really care what's true one way or the other
[2017-05-14 22:40:49 UTC] philtheboss2367: The detractors hired fake actors on that podcast lol
[2017-05-14 22:40:52 UTC] stevensonbilista: half life 3 confirmed
[2017-05-14 22:40:56 UTC] mr_izumi: Lol
[2017-05-14 22:40:59 UTC] kovorus: Kreygasm
[2017-05-14 22:41:09 UTC] iconicmaster1: Phil didn't tweet yet
[2017-05-14 22:41:21 UTC] kovorus: he did
[2017-05-14 22:41:21 UTC] abegamers: he did tweet to say that he has to leave, the podcast isn't coming back
[2017-05-14 22:41:25 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Yeah once a woman breaks through this mental barrier in their head that protects them from harm(Like cheating boyfriends or abusive people) they legit have orgasms that exceed normal ones as I have heard
[2017-05-14 22:41:41 UTC] iconicmaster1: Oh okay
[2017-05-14 22:41:53 UTC] hyperior21: @awbray1 Then you should have no problem providing us links to this proof. Oh btw, he got swatted and the only reason two cops showed up was because he warned them ahead of time. He never said he was in any danger, he said he COULD HAVE be if he didn't have the foresight to already warn them.
[2017-05-14 22:42:01 UTC] philtheboss2367: The detractors are no lives
[2017-05-14 22:42:17 UTC] deadpylons: why would anyone who does not like phil hire people to come here
[2017-05-14 22:42:22 UTC] philtheboss2367: They lie about everything
[2017-05-14 22:42:23 UTC] deadpylons: that's doing way to much
[2017-05-14 22:42:25 UTC] hyperior21: @awbray1 So stop fucking lying!
[2017-05-14 22:42:47 UTC] mr_izumi: You got lives?
[2017-05-14 22:42:56 UTC] philtheboss2367: No @deadpylons I'm talking about the Sok podcast
[2017-05-14 22:43:02 UTC] daddi_boi: @Hyperior21 chill dude
[2017-05-14 22:43:13 UTC] philtheboss2367: They hired fake actors pretending to be Laveria
[2017-05-14 22:43:17 UTC] iconicmaster1: Probably no week in preview tonight
[2017-05-14 22:43:21 UTC] lvlpower: Phil tweet Sorry folks for the abrupt end to the podcast stream, I have an emergency and have to leave. I'll update everyone later tonight.
[2017-05-14 22:43:32 UTC] mr_izumi: Any proof
[2017-05-14 22:43:47 UTC] deadpylons: im lost on all this so imma need a bit a catching up lol
[2017-05-14 22:43:51 UTC] bbt_2017: @deadpylons Why do podcasts focused on something you dislike? That has no impact on you? They're nuts SoK in a nutshell that's why they'd do that much.
[2017-05-14 22:43:57 UTC] mr_izumi: @philtheboss2367 proof
[2017-05-14 22:44:07 UTC] lvlpower: @mr_izumi go check it out at his Twitter
[2017-05-14 22:44:16 UTC] philtheboss2367: @mr_izumi Sok lied
[2017-05-14 22:44:27 UTC] ravioliluigi: hurrdurr im sok and im obsessed with phil
[2017-05-14 22:44:28 UTC] darthvidarviking: it was probably laveria. Even if it beggars belief that a company would go on a podcast discussing business and clients like they did.
[2017-05-14 22:44:32 UTC] lvlpower: !Twitter
[2017-05-14 22:44:33 UTC] nightbot: Follow me on Twitter! http://www.twitter.com/theycallmedsp
[2017-05-14 22:44:34 UTC] hyperior21: @daddi_boi I am chill. I'm just sick of you always lying, sandering, and trying to ruin his life because he said something you didn't like.
[2017-05-14 22:44:43 UTC] daddi_boi: @philtheboss2367 ah that's inarguable then
[2017-05-14 22:44:56 UTC] daddi_boi: @Hyperior21 i've done none of those things, but ok
[2017-05-14 22:44:58 UTC] kingjezal: There is no defending slander.
[2017-05-14 22:45:05 UTC] iconicmaster1: Amy anderssen Kreygasm
[2017-05-14 22:45:16 UTC] betheallen: where is the stream? did i miss something
[2017-05-14 22:45:21 UTC] chowb321: ended early
[2017-05-14 22:45:26 UTC] betheallen: why?
[2017-05-14 22:45:32 UTC] chowb321: family emergency
[2017-05-14 22:45:49 UTC] hyperior21: @daddi_boi Could have fooled me. You act like your a detractor.
[2017-05-14 22:45:49 UTC] abegamers: It might be a shady dealing to explain why you didn't "hire" somebody on the so-called laveria people's part, there should be a sense of confidentiality there, but there is nothing legally wrong about disclosing what they did
[2017-05-14 22:46:00 UTC] darthvidarviking: yes what @chowb321 is saying @BeTheAllen
[2017-05-14 22:46:02 UTC] bbt_2017: I'm literally getting DMs from these people and threats that I'll be mocked in their videos for supporting Phil üòÇ
[2017-05-14 22:46:13 UTC] ravioliluigi: xd
[2017-05-14 22:46:16 UTC] daddi_boi: @Hyperior21 no, i asked for evidence. but that makes me a slanderous piece of shit asshole in your eyes apparently
[2017-05-14 22:46:31 UTC] deadpylons: what is a "detractor"
[2017-05-14 22:46:38 UTC] darthvidarviking: @abegamers true but it is really unprofessional and shows that hey are acting to immature to run a business
[2017-05-14 22:46:50 UTC] ravioliluigi: is darthvidarviking /our/ guy?
[2017-05-14 22:46:51 UTC] radicalenzyme: RIP
[2017-05-14 22:46:55 UTC] mr_izumi: Do I just believe phils word?
[2017-05-14 22:47:01 UTC] iconicmaster1: Kelly Devine Kreygasm
[2017-05-14 22:47:05 UTC] leonaras: If you actually took the time to listen to it all Vidar, they are far from acting immature.
[2017-05-14 22:47:06 UTC] deadpylons: is it like someone who talked bad about DSP for no reason or what
[2017-05-14 22:47:09 UTC] abegamers: I can honestly agree with that as somebody who is pretty neutral in this, haters or phil I find them both entertaining in their own ways honestly
[2017-05-14 22:47:12 UTC] deathballer250: Its dumb ti believe someone just out of face value.
[2017-05-14 22:47:17 UTC] betheallen: oh hey sok_kevan nice troll message vidar he a troll btw
[2017-05-14 22:47:19 UTC] zuadjin517: PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt PJSalt
[2017-05-14 22:47:23 UTC] philtheboss2367: I mean Phil is truthful
[2017-05-14 22:47:38 UTC] podusmonens: sok_kevan is a cool dude Kappa
[2017-05-14 22:47:54 UTC] hyperior21: @daddo_boi You asked for evidence because you listen and CHOOSE to believe them blindly
[2017-05-14 22:47:57 UTC] gigixdarling: aye dudes, new to the stream HeyGuys
[2017-05-14 22:47:57 UTC] mr_izumi: @philtheboss2367 I don' know about that
[2017-05-14 22:48:00 UTC] kingjezal: I have the ability to merely glimpse one's face and determine whether they are a detractor under the guise of a fan.
[2017-05-14 22:48:00 UTC] zuadjin517: no more damage control#
[2017-05-14 22:48:03 UTC] darthvidarviking: @Leonaras I listen to it and what they did was really immature and unprofessional. What they said is not that important. You will not se a real CEO of a proffesional compoany do a thing lieke that
[2017-05-14 22:48:05 UTC] betheallen: he a cool guy but then he called phil goutboy ok then
[2017-05-14 22:48:07 UTC] abegamers: Like, it doesn't really matter if the laveria people were legit or not. Assume they were
[2017-05-14 22:48:23 UTC] daddi_boi: @Hyperior21 no, because phil could disprove a lot of it with some simple type of proof. that's why.
[2017-05-14 22:48:40 UTC] abegamers: at the end of the day, it shouldn't reflect poorly on phil to a fan of phil if a company didn't hire him. on the other side of things it was really unprofessional for the people on the podcast to explain things in depth as they did
[2017-05-14 22:48:41 UTC] deathballer250: @daddi_boi No he cannot nor does he EVER do that
[2017-05-14 22:49:19 UTC] philtheboss2367: The SoK randomly got 2 Laveria members out of no where? That's suspicious
[2017-05-14 22:49:36 UTC] mr_izumi: There website
[2017-05-14 22:49:37 UTC] chowb321: no they contacted them on twitter
[2017-05-14 22:49:46 UTC] mr_izumi: ^
[2017-05-14 22:49:52 UTC] abegamers: I'm saying it doesn't matter if they're legit, Imagine if somebody contacted any company that you put in a job application for, you can't be majorly faulted if they didn't hire you. the company can look like jackasses if they will explain to random people contacting them their exact reasons for not hiring
[2017-05-14 22:49:58 UTC] darthvidarviking: @abegamers no to go on a podcast like that as a CEO of a company is the worst business practice I have seen nomatter what phil did
[2017-05-14 22:50:19 UTC] mr_izumi: @darthvidarviking what?
[2017-05-14 22:50:21 UTC] gxpopcorn69: NO ITS NOT
[2017-05-14 22:50:25 UTC] gxpopcorn69: WTF
[2017-05-14 22:50:54 UTC] betheallen: phil lies? HA never...
[2017-05-14 22:50:59 UTC] betheallen: well
[2017-05-14 22:51:14 UTC] kingjezal: Phil lies for good reason. Safety, discretion.
[2017-05-14 22:51:18 UTC] ubetterstop: guys phil would never lie to his fans:/
[2017-05-14 22:51:19 UTC] betheallen: he probably does at times but still
[2017-05-14 22:51:19 UTC] abegamers: I'm not disagreeing with that, just saying that it was shady of them to do but regardless of there being truth there or not it shouldn't matter
[2017-05-14 22:51:24 UTC] yacherdy: what's going on here

[2017-05-14 22:52:00 UTC] bbt_2017: @darthvidarviking You can easily talk to the "leaders" of these people have you ever gotten a response from say Fred as to why they do this?
[2017-05-14 22:52:10 UTC] yacherdy: I'm on mfd's stream but I guess I'll double bag it.
[2017-05-14 22:52:11 UTC] mr_izumi: lot of the kool-aid people today huh
[2017-05-14 22:52:11 UTC] darthvidarviking: exactly what they say should not matter. It shows zero credibily to do a thing like that @abegamers
[2017-05-14 22:52:13 UTC] betheallen: first i get SOK_KEVAN
[2017-05-14 22:52:15 UTC] deathballer250: If Phil had values he would have stuck with curse but since he only cares about money he is flip flopping all over the place

[2017-05-14 22:52:41 UTC] ubetterstop: why did phil have to dip
[2017-05-14 22:52:51 UTC] mr_izumi: ^
[2017-05-14 22:52:51 UTC] abegamers: whether you hate or love phil it shouldn't be interpreted as some major mark on his character if a company didn't hire him
[2017-05-14 22:53:08 UTC] chowb321: @ubetterstop family emergency
[2017-05-14 22:53:17 UTC] podusmonens: what trolls, bethe?

[2017-05-14 22:53:29 UTC] darthvidarviking: he dodged a bullet not being with them in all honesty. They where the people in the wrong. No matter how you spinn it @abc

[2017-05-14 22:54:26 UTC] yacherdy: sorry
[2017-05-14 22:54:31 UTC] abegamers: 7.5 billion people in this world, it's fair to say millions try to apply for jobs and do not get hired on a daily basis. regardless of the reasons for not getting hired, it should only matter to the person trying to get the job.
[2017-05-14 22:55:47 UTC] mr_izumi: But Phil hasn't
[2017-05-14 22:56:36 UTC] mr_izumi: Hello?

[2017-05-14 22:57:01 UTC] darthvidarviking: it is a business betweeen the company and the person that is getting hired. Not a bussines for public affair. Especially when you are supposed to be a company with some integrityy @abegamers
[2017-05-14 22:57:21 UTC] hyperior21: So the proof is they had the "CEO" of Laveria on, and I am Donald Trump and because I said I am Donald Trump, that means I am Donald Trump. Whatever, I am done. Continue to bash on him and try to ruin his life because you somehow feel slighted.
[2017-05-14 22:57:41 UTC] betheallen: what is it with these fuckers right now AHHHHHHH
[2017-05-14 22:57:56 UTC] abegamers: yeah I completely agree with that as I said viking, I don't want to repeat myself but my point is simply that it shouldn't be some point against phil if they didn't hire him
[2017-05-14 22:58:01 UTC] betheallen: one comes and says allen sounds like a old man name
[2017-05-14 22:58:08 UTC] betheallen: well good i like it like that
[2017-05-14 22:58:12 UTC] betheallen: FECK OFF
[2017-05-14 22:58:34 UTC] abegamers: nobody goes through life without having a job application declined at least once
