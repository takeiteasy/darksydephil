[2017-05-12 00:02:09 UTC] podusmonens: someone linked him a clip of phil talking about buying a new car and he noticed that he bought all the usual bullshit that care dealers try with people
[2017-05-12 00:02:14 UTC] darthvidarviking: destiny fan?
[2017-05-12 00:02:16 UTC] podusmonens: car*

[2017-05-12 00:04:12 UTC] yacherdy: ahhh well

[2017-05-12 00:05:42 UTC] yacherdy: this reminds me of the boss in DA:O...just not as insane

[2017-05-12 00:05:58 UTC] darthvidarviking: out of healinitems?
[2017-05-12 00:06:49 UTC] yacherdy: I think at least 10 minutes

[2017-05-12 00:06:56 UTC] darthvidarviking: yea at least
[2017-05-12 00:07:43 UTC] yacherdy: lel
[2017-05-12 00:08:01 UTC] yacherdy: WutFace
[2017-05-12 00:08:34 UTC] podusmonens: "Most people have never heard of PS4 Pro or Project Scorpio"
[2017-05-12 00:08:35 UTC] zahvone: Feels
[2017-05-12 00:08:39 UTC] podusmonens: marketing geniuses
[2017-05-12 00:08:40 UTC] zahvone: Lool
[2017-05-12 00:09:05 UTC] yacherdy: who said that
[2017-05-12 00:09:18 UTC] yacherdy: Muffin hype
[2017-05-12 00:09:27 UTC] podusmonens: theverge article
[2017-05-12 00:09:31 UTC] zahvone: TwitchLit TwitchLit TwitchLit
[2017-05-12 00:09:50 UTC] yacherdy: jeez dragin
[2017-05-12 00:10:07 UTC] podusmonens: wha
[2017-05-12 00:10:20 UTC] yacherdy: they said that?
[2017-05-12 00:10:31 UTC] podusmonens: yes, it's based on statistics
[2017-05-12 00:10:55 UTC] yacherdy: So horrible marketing eh?
[2017-05-12 00:11:02 UTC] darthvidarviking: hmm
[2017-05-12 00:11:08 UTC] podusmonens: But generally speaking, the average player consumes far less news about these sectors than hobbyists and hardcore fans, and these consumers likely have only passing awareness of even the most seemingly obvious of game industry shifts. In fact, Nielsen reports that just 72 percent of gamers have ever heard of the Xbox One, let alone something as cryptic sounding as Project Scorpio.
[2017-05-12 00:11:49 UTC] yacherdy: I've heard of them obviously, I just don't care about VR
[2017-05-12 00:12:02 UTC] yacherdy: wait
[2017-05-12 00:12:08 UTC] darthvidarviking: I mean I have always taken in game information "organiacally" I never have read gaming magazines and such
[2017-05-12 00:12:43 UTC] darthvidarviking: It's like some friends plays a game they say it is great. You buy it
[2017-05-12 00:13:03 UTC] yacherdy: Is the Scorpio even VR compatible?
[2017-05-12 00:13:38 UTC] podusmonens: I would think so
[2017-05-12 00:13:44 UTC] darthvidarviking: Steam have a great return policy actually.
[2017-05-12 00:13:53 UTC] yacherdy: I don't think it will be initially
[2017-05-12 00:13:59 UTC] podusmonens: steam is great but also gets a lot of hate
[2017-05-12 00:14:35 UTC] yacherdy: I'm intimidated by my Steam library.
[2017-05-12 00:14:43 UTC] podusmonens: I Only have a few
[2017-05-12 00:14:45 UTC] darthvidarviking: Yeah many have that problem. I think I have bought games I have never played :/
[2017-05-12 00:14:48 UTC] podusmonens: most of them free to play
[2017-05-12 00:14:49 UTC] podusmonens: :D
[2017-05-12 00:15:27 UTC] yacherdy: no
[2017-05-12 00:15:31 UTC] yacherdy: the others, yes.
[2017-05-12 00:15:42 UTC] podusmonens: I have gta v but not on steam
[2017-05-12 00:15:44 UTC] darthvidarviking: gtav
[2017-05-12 00:15:46 UTC] podusmonens: if you catch my drift
[2017-05-12 00:15:52 UTC] darthvidarviking: i have that for pc. But I only played online
[2017-05-12 00:16:02 UTC] yacherdy: dragin did you "commit GTAV to memory"?
[2017-05-12 00:16:10 UTC] podusmonens: yes
[2017-05-12 00:16:12 UTC] yacherdy: ok
[2017-05-12 00:16:14 UTC] yacherdy: :D
[2017-05-12 00:16:55 UTC] yacherdy: RIP RDR Suicide Kings
[2017-05-12 00:17:00 UTC] yacherdy: from 2010
[2017-05-12 00:17:09 UTC] podusmonens: red ded
[2017-05-12 00:17:28 UTC] yacherdy: I hope it's on PC
[2017-05-12 00:17:47 UTC] yacherdy: Rockstar usually hates PC :D
[2017-05-12 00:17:55 UTC] yacherdy: sounds legit SeemsGood
[2017-05-12 00:18:07 UTC] yacherdy: Bully port is trash
[2017-05-12 00:18:34 UTC] podusmonens: cod the fish?
[2017-05-12 00:18:45 UTC] podusmonens: kahppa
[2017-05-12 00:18:45 UTC] yacherdy: idk it's just trash on PC :( Loved it on PS2 and 360 though
[2017-05-12 00:18:49 UTC] yacherdy: yes dragin
[2017-05-12 00:19:12 UTC] podusmonens: dunno gta V runs good on pc
[2017-05-12 00:19:23 UTC] darthvidarviking: I suppose it is dificoult to make to different Graphical architecture? I have no idea actually
[2017-05-12 00:19:35 UTC] yacherdy: GTA V isn't bad but GTA IV and the older ones run not so hot
[2017-05-12 00:19:46 UTC] yacherdy: GTA IV got its first update 6 months ago
[2017-05-12 00:20:00 UTC] podusmonens: I get min. 58, max 112 or so when I just walk on the streets by foot
[2017-05-12 00:20:04 UTC] podusmonens: fps*
[2017-05-12 00:20:14 UTC] darthvidarviking: It probably depends very on the engine it is build in too
[2017-05-12 00:20:23 UTC] darthvidarviking: some are easier to port then others I suppose
[2017-05-12 00:21:06 UTC] yacherdy: Dark Souls got ported to PC after the fact because there was so much demand :D
[2017-05-12 00:21:18 UTC] yacherdy: thats why its not optimized
[2017-05-12 00:22:06 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah there's hardcore skate. fans
[2017-05-12 00:22:49 UTC] yacherdy: After Pro Skater 4 I fell off the skateboarding scene
[2017-05-12 00:22:58 UTC] yacherdy: that was around 2002-2003
[2017-05-12 00:25:08 UTC] yacherdy: oh no worries man
[2017-05-12 00:25:10 UTC] yacherdy: :D
[2017-05-12 00:25:39 UTC] darthvidarviking: It's col watching you and listening too you man

[2017-05-12 00:27:30 UTC] yacherdy: not that I know of...she's still with Machinima I believe. Which is awkward.
[2017-05-12 00:28:59 UTC] yacherdy: oh jeez lol
[2017-05-12 00:29:17 UTC] sanguinenite: Hi Zahvone! Im back! Can someone set up an MCN so easily?

[2017-05-12 00:32:53 UTC] yacherdy: damn, it's a dead game :(
[2017-05-12 00:33:32 UTC] sanguinenite: I kinda had a feeling that a company contacting Phil for a managed partnership sounded too good to be true
[2017-05-12 00:34:09 UTC] yacherdy: yes

[2017-05-12 00:37:53 UTC] yacherdy: It's too bad that I didn't grow up on JRPGs...I'm just now getting into them. Never beaten a JRPG in my life.
[2017-05-12 00:38:23 UTC] yacherdy: I'm into Western RPGs big time though.
[2017-05-12 00:39:45 UTC] yacherdy: Favorite genre is action-RPG and favorite game is the Original Mass Effect
[2017-05-12 00:40:04 UTC] yacherdy: I don't know why I put a capital in Original but yeah
[2017-05-12 00:40:25 UTC] yacherdy: SeemsGood
[2017-05-12 00:40:49 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah, I get that a lot. People on my stream when I was playing it said the same thing.
[2017-05-12 00:41:24 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah, it's pretty sad..
[2017-05-12 00:42:19 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah once Xbox 360 and PS3 started rolling in that started to fade away a bit.
[2017-05-12 00:43:00 UTC] yacherdy: Gaming culture basically just exploded into the mainstream in the past ten years.
[2017-05-12 00:43:17 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah Crash 2 is my favorite Crash. Probably put 300 hours into it.
[2017-05-12 00:43:43 UTC] yacherdy: As a young kid, yeah. I would replay the levels over and over. :D
[2017-05-12 00:44:02 UTC] zahvone: Same here. I used to play it with my brothers and dad, we'd all take turns and it was great.
[2017-05-12 00:45:39 UTC] darthvidarviking: we don't have that in norway lol
[2017-05-12 00:45:41 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah I used to drink it

[2017-05-12 00:54:08 UTC] yacherdy: Phil's playthroughs used to be a great thing to play in the background...but now the whole bits/cheers thing takes away from that for me personally
[2017-05-12 00:54:08 UTC] sanguinenite: LOL Are you serious? I dont think so.
[2017-05-12 00:54:28 UTC] yacherdy: btw not hating, just stating personal preference

[2017-05-12 01:53:25 UTC] darksydephil: ok
[2017-05-12 01:53:27 UTC] darksydephil: setting up in a moment
[2017-05-12 01:53:44 UTC] zahvone: Hopefully I get to watch :c
[2017-05-12 01:53:50 UTC] darksydephil: will we have another mysterious modem reset tonight? we didn't have one earlier today during Prey which makes the whole thing so odd to begin with
[2017-05-12 01:54:03 UTC] darksydephil: you'd think if it were DDOS they'd want to shut down the stream with more people and tips and cheers going etc
[2017-05-12 01:54:08 UTC] darthvidarviking: hahaha let's hope not
[2017-05-12 01:54:15 UTC] darksydephil: the weirdest thing was
[2017-05-12 01:54:20 UTC] darksydephil: after i went offline last night, it happened 2 more times
[2017-05-12 01:54:48 UTC] darksydephil: like, as i was setting up uploads and afterward. it didn't have any effect whatsoever, because uploads just auto resume where they left off. so why would someone have attacked THEN when the stream was over?
[2017-05-12 01:54:58 UTC] darksydephil: it's just bizarre. and i still have no idea how they'd get my IP
[2017-05-12 01:55:07 UTC] darthvidarviking: if it is a cable network hickups do happen
[2017-05-12 01:55:33 UTC] darksydephil: yeah but then it should affect both of my internet lines, not just one. thats the really myserious thing that makes me suspect DDOS
[2017-05-12 01:56:47 UTC] darthvidarviking: don't you think it would stay down for longer if it was thouhg?
[2017-05-12 01:57:14 UTC] darksydephil: nope. because once its down, its down and just has to restart. it's a matter of how long it takes my modem to restart, not how long the attack lasts
[2017-05-12 01:57:20 UTC] darksydephil: ddos attacks are typically short and in bursts
[2017-05-12 01:58:32 UTC] darthvidarviking: I just know from experience that when I had a cable It was constantly some weird things and maintenence happening. After I changed to fiber. Not once...
[2017-05-12 01:59:17 UTC] sanguinenite: Maybe it is because your modem is just getting old, maybe switching out a new one. I use fiber optic internet.
[2017-05-12 01:59:35 UTC] dukexjt: maybe its gremlins
[2017-05-12 01:59:54 UTC] zahvone: Phil, it must be Atlus / Phantom thieves coming for your treasure: Your internet Kappa
[2017-05-12 02:00:12 UTC] darksydephil: this modem is brand new. as in, only a month old lol
[2017-05-12 02:00:34 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You didn't happen to get a calling card in red with spirals by any chance did you?
[2017-05-12 02:00:35 UTC] deep_drive: Wouldn't a ddos just slow the modem and not shut it off.
[2017-05-12 02:00:53 UTC] darksydephil: no, the purpose of DDOS is to flood the modem with so much data in such a short time it forces a restart
[2017-05-12 02:00:59 UTC] darksydephil: hence the denial of service
[2017-05-12 02:01:37 UTC] darksydephil: this modem has tons of firewall settings, but without an expert analyzing the data coming in at me, there's no way to know how to set it up properly. and im no expert
[2017-05-12 02:01:58 UTC] soulrider95: DDOS isn't that, it's a longer thing
[2017-05-12 02:02:01 UTC] darksydephil: let's see what happens tonight. as we now now, its not a huge deal, it only wastes a few minutes
[2017-05-12 02:02:09 UTC] soulrider95: it's not supposed to always crash, just make sure no data happens
[2017-05-12 02:02:15 UTC] soulrider95: if it was a DDOS you'd be offline for hours, not minutes
[2017-05-12 02:02:20 UTC] darksydephil: completely wrong lol
[2017-05-12 02:02:24 UTC] soulrider95: Uhh.... no?
[2017-05-12 02:02:28 UTC] darksydephil: um, yes
[2017-05-12 02:02:36 UTC] soulrider95: Considering this is my job... no
[2017-05-12 02:02:41 UTC] darksydephil: ive been ddos attacked before and it acted exactly in this manner. we had logs to prove it
[2017-05-12 02:02:46 UTC] soulrider95: DDOS wouldn't knock you out for minutes
[2017-05-12 02:02:48 UTC] darksydephil: you may be describing one manner of ddos attack but not all of them
[2017-05-12 02:02:51 UTC] soulrider95: it would be MUCH longe
[2017-05-12 02:02:59 UTC] soulrider95: you're getting DOS'd at best, not DDOS'd
[2017-05-12 02:03:02 UTC] soulrider95: there's a difference
[2017-05-12 02:03:04 UTC] imaidenr: @DarksydePhil do you have a favorite Resident Evil game?
[2017-05-12 02:03:17 UTC] darksydephil: you're arguing semantics that don't matter. its the same end effect
[2017-05-12 02:03:25 UTC] soulrider95: one is one computer, one is thousands
[2017-05-12 02:03:28 UTC] zahvone: Hm
[2017-05-12 02:03:31 UTC] soulrider95: different effects
[2017-05-12 02:03:40 UTC] zahvone: Hopefully I'll be able to catch your stream tonight.
[2017-05-12 02:03:43 UTC] darksydephil: probably resident evil 1 is my fave. the original and i playe dit at launch
[2017-05-12 02:03:48 UTC] darksydephil: it was pretty damn sweet

[2017-05-12 02:04:11 UTC] yacherdy: fixed*
[2017-05-12 02:04:25 UTC] soulrider95: It could just be a modem issue
[2017-05-12 02:04:29 UTC] soulrider95: or an upstream dB issue

[2017-05-12 02:04:57 UTC] darksydephil: which makes no sense soulrider, because i streamed 4 hours already today with no issues. how does it just happen to be between 9-10pm my local time every night tha ti have this issue?

[2017-05-12 02:05:13 UTC] soulrider95: It could be the local distribution box nearby or whatever

[2017-05-12 02:05:26 UTC] yacherdy: I know modems do when they automatically update
[2017-05-12 02:05:29 UTC] darksydephil: the local box was checked 1 month ago
[2017-05-12 02:05:35 UTC] phoenixrising2015: My older modem would legit turn off at like 1 am every night
[2017-05-12 02:05:42 UTC] darksydephil: so thats why its suspect that its anything here on my end. guy was just out, cleaned everythign up and gave me a new modem
[2017-05-12 02:05:44 UTC] phoenixrising2015: It would come back on shortly but still
[2017-05-12 02:06:00 UTC] yacherdy: Phil did you check if any incoming packets came your way?
[2017-05-12 02:06:20 UTC] sanguinenite: So many factors, like for me, my ISP sometimes cut off the internet early in the morning because they are fixing internet cables or doing maintence
[2017-05-12 02:06:23 UTC] darksydephil: YaCherdy its hard to tell, because for some reason this modem didn't log anything specific. last time i was ddos attacked there was a large record of it
[2017-05-12 02:06:38 UTC] soulrider95: I don't think you quite understand how a modem works, it can lose signal due to many, many reasons
[2017-05-12 02:06:42 UTC] yacherdy: Hmmm.

[2017-05-12 18:07:49 UTC] thesupervillain543: they gave it a 4 because the reviewer ran into a game breaking bug
[2017-05-12 18:07:50 UTC] darksydephil: IGN says it sucks, so it sucks even if its enjoyable
[2017-05-12 18:08:10 UTC] betheallen: ok i guess it sucks THANKS IGN
