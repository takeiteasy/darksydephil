[2017-05-27 00:06:28 UTC] fuzzydude64: I see that word is banned.
[2017-05-27 00:06:42 UTC] fuzzydude64: That's hilarious. Good job, Phil

[2017-05-27 01:12:28 UTC] theadamlee23: I'm trying to eat my dinner before DSP plays Friday the 13th.
[2017-05-27 01:12:36 UTC] bigdroock: GOAT!
[2017-05-27 01:12:43 UTC] deep_drive: stream won't be for about another 50 mins fyi
[2017-05-27 01:12:57 UTC] theadamlee23: I'll be lucky if I play with him because I bought the game on release date.
[2017-05-27 01:13:15 UTC] deep_drive: Isn't the matchmaking random though?
[2017-05-27 01:13:45 UTC] theadamlee23: There is a private match in Friday the 13th.
[2017-05-27 01:14:18 UTC] deep_drive: Oh ok. Sort of like having a private lobby. That'd be cool if you could play with friends
[2017-05-27 01:15:01 UTC] darksydephil: i didnt even know that
[2017-05-27 01:15:06 UTC] deep_drive: I haven't gotten the game, and am not sure if I want to shell out 40 dollars for this
[2017-05-27 01:15:09 UTC] darksydephil: i guess ill try randoms and then maybe some people from stream
[2017-05-27 01:15:18 UTC] darksydephil: yeah, i dunno, it seems REALLY suspect that it'd be worth 40 bucks
[2017-05-27 01:15:33 UTC] theadamlee23: Yes, there is a private match.
[2017-05-27 01:16:16 UTC] theadamlee23: Quick play I'm thinking is a random match? I don't know.

[2017-05-27 01:18:04 UTC] darksydephil: which community? the forums or the injustice guild?
[2017-05-27 01:18:09 UTC] darksydephil: or another one i dont know about lol
[2017-05-27 01:18:33 UTC] theadamlee23: The King of Hate Community on PS4
[2017-05-27 01:18:37 UTC] darksydephil: oh

[2017-05-27 01:18:52 UTC] deep_drive: lol

[2017-05-27 01:19:21 UTC] darksydephil: thats how i work out, i carry around a full desk with PC setup on top of it
[2017-05-27 01:19:31 UTC] deep_drive: dspHmm looks like a bot unfortunately
[2017-05-27 01:19:40 UTC] darksydephil: of course it is lol
[2017-05-27 01:19:56 UTC] theadamlee23: It's ok Phil. You're still one of the funniest people I seen.
[2017-05-27 01:20:10 UTC] deep_drive: improv is Phils forte
[2017-05-27 01:20:33 UTC] darksydephil: ok im off to relax for 30 mins or so, then i'll be back for friday the 13th. by the way, a new dsp tries it should be going live any time now!
[2017-05-27 01:20:54 UTC] deep_drive: ok sounds good im gonna make myself some dinner before the stream

[2017-05-27 01:45:28 UTC] blue_blur64: Good, now I know you aren't a bot :P
[2017-05-27 01:46:03 UTC] theadamlee23: I never thought of being here.
[2017-05-27 01:47:22 UTC] theadamlee23: I'm excited and ready too!
[2017-05-27 01:49:07 UTC] expertgaming8990: :) RiOT OR RiOT :)
[2017-05-27 01:51:41 UTC] bsheep85: darksydephil please read this message
[2017-05-27 01:51:43 UTC] deep_drive: yup he was saying earlier he joined phils ps4 community silent
[2017-05-27 01:52:26 UTC] phoenixrising2015: If Phil tries this game again and it says "Connection error" I wouldn't be shocked if he threw his controller
[2017-05-27 01:52:30 UTC] kuro8116: i AM SPARTiCUS
[2017-05-27 01:53:40 UTC] deep_drive: all these obvious bots
[2017-05-27 01:53:45 UTC] blue_blur64: so did you guys try out ARMS?
[2017-05-27 01:54:15 UTC] darksydephil: people own the switch to try it? lol
[2017-05-27 01:54:55 UTC] theadamlee23: I don't have a microphone for PS4 but I can try.
[2017-05-27 01:55:06 UTC] blue_blur64: Well it is selling faster than the Wii is so far :P
[2017-05-27 01:55:13 UTC] blue_blur64: *Wii did
[2017-05-27 01:55:48 UTC] theadamlee23: I'll probably won't since it doesn't matter.
[2017-05-27 01:55:49 UTC] deep_drive: well i don't have a switch...you play arms blue?
[2017-05-27 01:55:49 UTC] darksydephil: you seriously shouldn't believe anything you hear like that lol
[2017-05-27 01:56:05 UTC] darksydephil: the Wii was literally so popular, everyone who didn't play games wanted one. the Switch isn't like that, at all. it's bullshit
[2017-05-27 01:56:24 UTC] darksydephil: they can manipulate numbers to make anything sound like its crazy popular when in reality it isnt
[2017-05-27 01:56:44 UTC] deep_drive: Let's compare the purchase/return ratio
[2017-05-27 01:56:48 UTC] deep_drive: that'd be more accurate
[2017-05-27 01:56:49 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Phil, I highly recommend Shadow Warrior 2. Its an RPG light FPS game, and knowing your humor on the stream, this game was made for you I think
[2017-05-27 01:57:18 UTC] blue_blur64: That'd be a lot of companies cooperating with Nintendo to manipulate the numbers then xD
[2017-05-27 01:57:23 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The opening scene literally has you driving, and a demon grabs a rabbit mid coitus with another rabbit and throws it at your windshield
[2017-05-27 01:57:34 UTC] theadamlee23: I'll be playing matches on Friday the 13th too so I can get warmed up.
[2017-05-27 01:57:35 UTC] darksydephil: it doesn't even make sense. outside of zelda theres nothing to play on switch. why would it be SO popular? IT's not like Wii where there was tons of shovelware for casuals
[2017-05-27 01:57:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Isn't Hollow Knight Switch Only?
[2017-05-27 01:57:55 UTC] phoenixrising2015: If not I may get that next time I can
[2017-05-27 01:58:33 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I wish it was console ported though to the PS4 if its not. My computer may not be able to handle it
[2017-05-27 01:58:41 UTC] blue_blur64: There's actually quite a bit to play now (at least for me)
[2017-05-27 01:59:12 UTC] deep_drive: like 1 2 switch?
[2017-05-27 01:59:13 UTC] darksydephil: I REALLY want to know what these switch statistics are. like the Wii was incredibly popular but they also produced a shit ton of hte console so the stores were never out. Switch magically is just constantly out, like they can't make more, enough to stock the shelves? that's bullshit lol
[2017-05-27 01:59:37 UTC] chachamaru89: Monster hunter xx was just announced to come to switch
[2017-05-27 01:59:37 UTC] darksydephil: i get the feeling the numbers are based on how quickly they're selling. there's no fucking way switch is selling MORE than the Wii did. that was one time phenomena
[2017-05-27 01:59:39 UTC] phoenixrising2015: For those who don't know what Hollow Knight is, its like a massive Metroidvania game that can take double digit hours to get everything
[2017-05-27 01:59:51 UTC] tha_lol_guy: lol facts @DarksydePhil
[2017-05-27 01:59:52 UTC] theadamlee23: Luckily, I'm not planning on buying the Switch.
[2017-05-27 02:00:07 UTC] chachamaru89: More news regarding english version coming soon
[2017-05-27 02:00:22 UTC] darksydephil: okay ready to try this game again? lol
[2017-05-27 02:00:25 UTC] chachamaru89: Monster hunter is pretty big, ppl will love it
[2017-05-27 02:00:32 UTC] theadamlee23: I wish you luck Phil.
[2017-05-27 02:00:41 UTC] deep_drive: lets cross our fingers lol
[2017-05-27 02:00:41 UTC] chocolaterampage30: @DarksydePhil hopefully it works man lol
[2017-05-27 02:00:43 UTC] mlgmemescoper: YES PLEASE PHILLY
[2017-05-27 02:00:49 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Oh ok Hollow knight is PC only atm it seems
[2017-05-27 02:00:55 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Switch and PS4 this year
[2017-05-27 02:00:58 UTC] phoenixrising2015: can't wait
[2017-05-27 02:01:33 UTC] phoenixrising2015: And yeah there is no way I can run that game on my PC looking at the specs
[2017-05-27 02:01:39 UTC] encelor: hello
[2017-05-27 02:01:58 UTC] sirdi3salot: Hey Phil i just want you to know that Gun Media is a 4 man team
[2017-05-27 02:01:58 UTC] lvlpower: @encelor wassup
[2017-05-27 02:02:33 UTC] captcaveman4201: oi
[2017-05-27 02:02:52 UTC] lvlpower: attempt number 2
[2017-05-27 02:02:54 UTC] captcaveman4201: im watchin the new dsp trys it
[2017-05-27 02:02:59 UTC] darksydephil: well if this game doesn't work again, it'll be a zero man team, because i'm going to hunt them down like Jason for my money back!
[2017-05-27 02:03:03 UTC] encelor: how is friday the 13th?
[2017-05-27 02:03:10 UTC] theadamlee23: Let's just hope that this game doesn't suck like LGN's version on NES.
[2017-05-27 02:03:14 UTC] encelor: i saw it had good reviews on steam
[2017-05-27 02:03:19 UTC] sirdi3salot: Online only isn't the best option but F13 was always that. People begged and funded for Single Player so that's the only reason why we are getting offline content Late Summer
[2017-05-27 02:03:20 UTC] theadamlee23: LJN, excuse me
[2017-05-27 02:03:29 UTC] bananabryant: hows everybody?
[2017-05-27 02:03:34 UTC] lvlpower: refund
[2017-05-27 02:03:37 UTC] captcaveman4201: friday the 13th is bad luck... go figure
[2017-05-27 02:03:42 UTC] sanguinenite: lol phil so I am guessing the first stream was a complete fail
[2017-05-27 02:03:45 UTC] blue_blur64: Ok, I found an article doing launch number comparisons http://www.businessinsider.com/nintendo-switch-vs-wii-wii-u-sales-chart-2017-5
[2017-05-27 02:03:46 UTC] deep_drive: They don't even have a workable offline mode at launch
[2017-05-27 02:03:55 UTC] mlgmemescoper: @captcaveman4201 XDDDDDD
[2017-05-27 02:03:56 UTC] sirdi3salot: Day 1 for any online game isn't the best
[2017-05-27 02:04:10 UTC] dashxero: Is this the old Jason game or the new one?
[2017-05-27 02:04:12 UTC] encelor: wait the f13th not working?
[2017-05-27 02:04:13 UTC] sirdi3salot: They never promised offline like i said
[2017-05-27 02:04:21 UTC] theadamlee23: That is true, most release days are bad luck for online games.
[2017-05-27 02:04:30 UTC] sanguinenite: online games suck because it needs a stable internet connection, which cannot be bought for just 60 bucks
[2017-05-27 02:04:34 UTC] glitch_crazed: CoolStoryBob
[2017-05-27 02:04:44 UTC] sirdi3salot: They only added Single Player and Offline coming Late summer because people begged and funded for it
[2017-05-27 02:04:46 UTC] bass619: oh look the italian snorting disgusting pig is back
[2017-05-27 02:04:55 UTC] blue_blur64: and now you're gone
[2017-05-27 02:05:03 UTC] darksydephil: oh
[2017-05-27 02:05:04 UTC] lvlpower: This remind me of star wars
[2017-05-27 02:05:06 UTC] darksydephil: so there you have it blue_blur64
[2017-05-27 02:05:15 UTC] darksydephil: the numbers mean nothing. even the Wii U sold well at launch. and then tanked lol
[2017-05-27 02:05:18 UTC] thedoctor5437: I thought Friday the 13th game was about u being Jason not multiplayer shit
[2017-05-27 02:05:29 UTC] katexo234: hey everyone
[2017-05-27 02:05:38 UTC] ellietsantiara: Hello Hello everyone, Good evening Phil TheIlluminati TheIlluminati

[2017-05-27 02:06:06 UTC] captcaveman4201: if the made a jason x video game that woulda been fun
[2017-05-27 02:06:07 UTC] darksydephil: ok stream looking good?
[2017-05-27 02:06:14 UTC] blue_blur64: You're either Jason or one of the teens trying to survive
[2017-05-27 02:06:17 UTC] johnmatrix31: @DarksydePhil yes looks great
[2017-05-27 02:06:17 UTC] ellietsantiara: Hi boi
[2017-05-27 02:06:19 UTC] movielord101: Someone needs to make a t-shirt of him saying "Oh Hello" while getting jumpscared by one of the guys from Outlast.
[2017-05-27 02:06:19 UTC] dashxero: Looks good, Phil.
[2017-05-27 02:06:19 UTC] lvlpower: Friday the 13 the video game should have had a campaign story mode
[2017-05-27 02:06:19 UTC] darksydephil: i liked it KushiYakitori despite the "twist" being incredibly cheesy, it was fun
[2017-05-27 02:06:22 UTC] patrickdub: all good buddy

[2017-05-27 02:06:34 UTC] katexo234: ty @kushiyakitori for asking that question :D
[2017-05-27 02:06:37 UTC] blue_blur64: The main thing I heard about this game is that patience is key
[2017-05-27 02:06:37 UTC] pray4rock: Let's get the show going, before the servers crap out again
[2017-05-27 02:06:40 UTC] johnmatrix31: @DarksydePhil what do you think of jason from part 5? aka roy
[2017-05-27 02:06:41 UTC] sirdi3salot: I got to see Guardians 2 yesterday because i won a free ticket

[2017-05-27 18:00:00 UTC] phoenixrising2015: If Kazuma is in the game, he needs to be overpowered
[2017-05-27 18:00:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: So beating him would be an accomplishment in itself
[2017-05-27 18:00:53 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I mean the man in his early forties held Akiyama and Tatsuo on his arm and shoulder and managed to suplex both of them at the same time

[2017-05-27 18:04:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you have to go to jackbox (dot) tv when Phil is playing the game he'll give out a room code for people to enter.
[2017-05-27 18:04:26 UTC] betheallen: i know you have to go to a website and put in a 4 digit code to get in, even then it might not work
[2017-05-27 18:04:32 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I presume there is an app for it
[2017-05-27 18:04:40 UTC] phoenixrising2015: There is no app
[2017-05-27 18:04:46 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah my bad

[2017-05-27 18:04:53 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Just go to the site on your phone
[2017-05-27 18:05:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Granted its harder on your phone to type and such but its a site to connect
[2017-05-27 18:05:20 UTC] xthewrath93x: id rather do it on PC
[2017-05-27 18:05:21 UTC] xthewrath93x: easier

[2017-05-27 18:07:10 UTC] xthewrath93x: maybe il tweet him
[2017-05-27 18:07:12 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The main problem with Jackbox is that with a lot of people's streams its not instantaneous so the site will ask you to vote on something, and when you finally see what you are supposed to vote on in the stream, the jackbox site has moved on due to you wasting time
[2017-05-27 18:07:30 UTC] betheallen: WOOOOOOOO

[2017-05-27 18:08:12 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like it will say "Which is worst? 1 or 2?" and by the time it pops up the game has left without you answering
[2017-05-27 18:08:19 UTC] xthewrath93x: chelsea scored LUL

[2017-05-27 18:09:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and how you can miss out on answering questions due to the fact you can't see what it wants you to talk about until its too late

[2017-05-27 18:11:03 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Gordon Ramsey has the best twitter account ever outside of the Wendy's one
[2017-05-27 18:11:06 UTC] theycallmejimbob: first half of the stream will be patreons only playing Taurus second half will be Phil vs the World
[2017-05-27 18:11:30 UTC] taurusoxford: Yeah, but the question was will one half be full of trolling or both halves? :P
[2017-05-27 18:11:31 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I actually saw one Ramsey tweet where someone actually got his seal of approval
[2017-05-27 18:12:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: It was a guy who made a huge bone of meat

[2017-05-27 18:47:10 UTC] betheallen: yep
[2017-05-27 18:47:26 UTC] chachamaru89: Well his dick lightning isnt cheating as well, but we all know how that turn out
[2017-05-27 18:48:05 UTC] chrisbreezy00: i mean he beat Nioh using only low stance
[2017-05-27 18:48:21 UTC] taurusoxford: mid-stance
[2017-05-27 18:48:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: mid stance best stance
[2017-05-27 18:48:29 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: but couldn't beat Nioh DLC
[2017-05-27 18:48:34 UTC] chachamaru89: That d be mid stance spear only
[2017-05-27 18:48:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: WRONG TheNewFaceofCreation

[2017-05-27 18:48:49 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: so he borequit it @theycallmejimbob :p
[2017-05-27 18:49:06 UTC] xgameofpwns: @TheNewFaceofCreation it's not that he couldn't beat it it's just that it was boring and a poorly executed DLC..but mainly boring
[2017-05-27 18:49:10 UTC] chrisbreezy00: i remember his very first ragequit
[2017-05-27 18:49:13 UTC] xgameofpwns: Kappa
[2017-05-27 18:49:15 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Skate 2
[2017-05-27 18:49:19 UTC] taurusoxford: He "thisDLCistoohard - quit" Nioh DLC
[2017-05-27 18:49:24 UTC] theycallmejimbob: His schedule was too hectic so he had to take a break from playing it, plus noone in the streamchat was interested in a DLC
[2017-05-27 18:49:34 UTC] akioartorius: so 12:00?
[2017-05-27 18:49:38 UTC] chachamaru89: The dlc is fine
[2017-05-27 18:49:38 UTC] theycallmejimbob: 12:30
[2017-05-27 18:49:47 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: so none in the stream chat was interested in PJSalt ?
[2017-05-27 18:49:48 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Honestly, he could have easily beaten it if he had just leveled up during his initial playthrough to overpower enemies instead of just skimming the line to at the same level they were
[2017-05-27 18:49:49 UTC] akioartorius: ok I will be back
[2017-05-27 18:49:59 UTC] xthewrath93x: there needs to be a patrons goal for dsp starting on time lol
[2017-05-27 18:50:07 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Any Dark Souls player knows to overlevel and never give a quarter
[2017-05-27 18:50:08 UTC] xgameofpwns: I think he should go back to Nioh dlc on one of those off days where there's nothing to play....more views than persona
[2017-05-27 18:50:17 UTC] taurusoxford: @TheNewFaceofCreation pretty sure everyone loves seeing Phil get salty
[2017-05-27 18:50:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil also said he didn't like the direction Team Ninja took with the dlc Delta
[2017-05-27 18:50:23 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Honestly bosses that one shot you aren't really rage inducing since you know getting hit means your fucked
[2017-05-27 18:50:34 UTC] chachamaru89: Wait since when noone interested in nioh dlc?
[2017-05-27 18:50:36 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Bosses like persona 3 final boss and his full HP healing is more rage inducing for me
[2017-05-27 18:50:40 UTC] chrisbreezy00: since it just trolls you
[2017-05-27 18:50:47 UTC] xgameofpwns: @TheNewFaceofCreation i enjoy watching salty gamers in general i think it's entertaining
[2017-05-27 18:50:49 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: cuz he couldn't beat it means the DLC sucked? i dont get it
[2017-05-27 18:51:09 UTC] taurusoxford: @Chachamaru89 People were interested - jimbob is trolling
[2017-05-27 18:51:11 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @chrisbreezy00 Again, that wouldn't be an issue if he actually overleveled in Nioh to begin with. Its like Dark Souls. You need to over prepare
[2017-05-27 18:51:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I think he said it during Hate Live that there wasn't much interest in the DLC I could be wrong Chachamaru89
[2017-05-27 18:51:18 UTC] soulrider95: The DLC was meant for people who kept playing after "beating" it
[2017-05-27 18:51:27 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: i agree with that
[2017-05-27 18:51:37 UTC] soulrider95: not people who hit the credits and didn't do anything with it until the DLC dropped
[2017-05-27 18:51:50 UTC] chachamaru89: Well i saw ppl told him to play it both on forums and here
[2017-05-27 18:52:07 UTC] dspfandood: late dood
[2017-05-27 18:52:18 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: dont worry. phil is late too
[2017-05-27 18:52:40 UTC] chrisbreezy00: I remember when phill beat Resident evil on hard difficulty it was his biggest accomplishment lol
