[2017-05-08 00:00:02 UTC] yacherdy: so wait is Destiny anti-SJW or SJW?
[2017-05-08 00:00:08 UTC] waveow: phil youre views jumped x2 from what it was you dont beg for advice on shit but you beg your viewers to throw money at you LUL
[2017-05-08 00:00:10 UTC] zahvone: @ZaitaNZ Imagine a bunch of random people on the street approaching you that way saying "They just want to talk"
[2017-05-08 00:00:10 UTC] biggershekel: He's pro pedo
[2017-05-08 00:00:14 UTC] mxtt10589: that still didn't stop a burying messages
[2017-05-08 00:00:18 UTC] yacherdy: WutFace
[2017-05-08 00:00:21 UTC] darksydephil: ZaitaNZ he disrupted my business, TWICE, in some kind of an attempt to get attention. that's not what an adult does. that's not being closed minded, that's not being an idiot.
[2017-05-08 00:00:22 UTC] podusmonens: neither, cherd, but he is kind of anti-anti-SJW
[2017-05-08 00:00:25 UTC] zaitanz: @Zahvone and the harm in having a chat is?
[2017-05-08 00:00:29 UTC] daddi_boi: @Zahvone that's not remotely comparable
[2017-05-08 00:00:30 UTC] podusmonens: but not a full blown SJW
[2017-05-08 00:00:31 UTC] yacherdy: gotcha dragin
[2017-05-08 00:00:31 UTC] pcgamehunter: Does it matter what label he is ? Is he retarded is a more appropriate question ?
[2017-05-08 00:00:33 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: @YaCherdy he's SJW he's the reason JonTron's reputation got hit last month
[2017-05-08 00:00:35 UTC] zahvone: @ZaitaNZ There is no harm, it's a choice.
[2017-05-08 00:00:35 UTC] pcgamehunter: can he use email ?
[2017-05-08 00:00:38 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: DarksydePhil It did not conduct a "stream raid", he was simply talking about you on stream, and viewers naturally went over. I dont see how this is a negative thing, it just means more exposure for you.
[2017-05-08 00:00:48 UTC] zahvone: You can either want to have one, or not. He simply chose not to.
[2017-05-08 00:00:48 UTC] yacherdy: @kevindeleonisscum gotcha
[2017-05-08 00:00:48 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: DarksydePhil The mods should be able to handle any malicious spam
[2017-05-08 00:00:56 UTC] zahvone: We need 2 more mods, I believe.
[2017-05-08 00:00:57 UTC] ohuken: its not the type of exposure he wants
[2017-05-08 00:01:00 UTC] soulrider95: DarksydePhil calling him an idiot and close minded is pretty rude
[2017-05-08 00:01:01 UTC] zaitanz: @DarksydePhil viewers increase your business, bringing attn to you increases it.
[2017-05-08 00:01:02 UTC] zahvone: and 1 community manager.
[2017-05-08 00:01:06 UTC] podusmonens: he didn't tell his viewers to "raid", they went by themselves
[2017-05-08 00:01:11 UTC] waveow: DarksydePhil just enjoys his safe space its okay guys
[2017-05-08 00:01:12 UTC] daddi_boi: disrupted your business by cheering?
[2017-05-08 00:01:15 UTC] zaitanz: Destiny would literally gain nothing from helping you
[2017-05-08 00:01:16 UTC] duderito2: It's not a negative thing for his dickriders to spam the chat insulting him ?
[2017-05-08 00:01:18 UTC] darksydephil: we don't need more mods, we need less people doing nonsense like this today lol
[2017-05-08 00:01:28 UTC] zaitanz: It'd be the same as me helping you, no gain for me. Just offering to be nice
[2017-05-08 00:01:30 UTC] mxtt10589: another thing was the he wanted phil to use skype, no it was already established a long time ago that skype sucks and phil dosn't want another IP leak
[2017-05-08 00:01:33 UTC] zahvone: I'm always here, HopeseedPhil. Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:01:33 UTC] bethebaby: Well you can't control people.
[2017-05-08 00:01:41 UTC] waveow: DarksydePhil welcome to twitch Kappa this isnt youtube
[2017-05-08 00:01:45 UTC] pcgamehunter: @DarksydePhil Well that's not happening, you'd been on the internet long enough to know that I hope :/
[2017-05-08 00:01:46 UTC] podusmonens: his IP won't get leaked
[2017-05-08 00:01:51 UTC] darksydephil: he wanted me to skype him? that wouldn't have happened regardless lol
[2017-05-08 00:01:52 UTC] pcgamehunter: 've*
[2017-05-08 00:01:53 UTC] mxtt10589: tell that the first time
[2017-05-08 00:01:55 UTC] stinkinburrows: Who mention Phil? i just got back
[2017-05-08 00:01:58 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: @ZaitaNZ Destiny brings a LOT of baggage with him. Phil associating with him would possibly get him targteed by The_Donald and other alt-right groups
[2017-05-08 00:02:17 UTC] areyoushivering: that would be retarded, phil does zero politics
[2017-05-08 00:02:18 UTC] waveow: DarksydePhil why not have a friendly convo? you get more viewers off him on top of it more money that you need
[2017-05-08 00:02:19 UTC] bethebaby: @DarksydePhil Yeah well why not?
[2017-05-08 00:02:22 UTC] zaitanz: @kevindeleonisscum lol.. so you go immediately to the extreme?
[2017-05-08 00:02:28 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: DarksydePhil Why not? If you're worried about security he has discord
[2017-05-08 00:02:29 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Zahvone has ties to Russia don't trust him Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:02:30 UTC] zaitanz: "I don't drink water, incase I drown"
[2017-05-08 00:02:39 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: @ZaitaNZ Were you paying attention to what happened between JonTron and Destiny last month?
[2017-05-08 00:02:47 UTC] zahvone: @pcgamehunter I might have a single tie in russia, but it looks damn good on me.
[2017-05-08 00:02:57 UTC] mxtt10589: @bethebaby cause due to skype his IP got leaked before and he got DDOS attacked a while back
[2017-05-08 00:02:59 UTC] darksydephil: um, viewers dont' amount to money on twitch. that's twitch 101 really. i dont care about getting 1k extra viewers who want to talk about car financing when im trying to focus on playing a game. thats just an annoying distraction
[2017-05-08 00:03:04 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Zahvone Kreygasm
[2017-05-08 00:03:11 UTC] zahvone: Lmao
[2017-05-08 00:03:21 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Zahvone lol you should have run in the US election you'd beat Trump with that line alone :D
[2017-05-08 00:03:29 UTC] soulrider95: To be fair the commentary consisted of "WOW I DIED INSTANTLY" and "X CHEERED Y AMOUNT THANKS"
[2017-05-08 00:03:35 UTC] zaitanz: @kevindeleonisscum because JonTron seed racially controversial comments?
[2017-05-08 00:03:47 UTC] waveow: DarksydePhil i mean you put out your business out there what do you want ? people not to comment on it ?
[2017-05-08 00:03:49 UTC] zahvone: @pcgamehunter I'd have @YaCherdy as my vice
[2017-05-08 00:03:55 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Zahvone get out
[2017-05-08 00:04:00 UTC] zahvone: Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:04:00 UTC] pcgamehunter: Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:04:04 UTC] ocid: phil you're such a trainwreck
[2017-05-08 00:04:12 UTC] zaitanz: @DarksydePhil true, but someone like me might see you higher on the list, enjoy your stream and subscribe. Instead, I see you getting shitty at someone offering help and bitching people out
[2017-05-08 00:04:12 UTC] daddi_boi: lul
[2017-05-08 00:04:14 UTC] captcaveman4201: ya screw dystiny
[2017-05-08 00:04:16 UTC] duderito2: Phil has always said it he isn't a drama channel he just plays games, as if he want to associate with that dramawhore nothing good would come from it.
[2017-05-08 00:04:30 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: @ZaitaNZ They're being a bit of a hivemind right now. Any friend of Destiny's would be considered an enemy of them. There's a big risk for Phil if he associates with Destiny.
[2017-05-08 00:04:42 UTC] mxtt10589: @Ocid all he's doing is playing the game
[2017-05-08 00:04:42 UTC] leandrus94: Phil complaining about the chat talking about something else = Can't read what to do next whenever I get stuck
[2017-05-08 00:04:42 UTC] llpoole: Me! REE!
[2017-05-08 00:04:44 UTC] pcgamehunter: OK you can have @YaCherdy as VP, if I can have one of his owls as a pet Kappa @Zahvone
[2017-05-08 00:04:44 UTC] podusmonens: destiny stays away from drama too
[2017-05-08 00:04:51 UTC] zaitanz: @kevindeleonisscum stay inside, never go out, never fly, don't drink water. Stay safe dude
[2017-05-08 00:04:52 UTC] zahvone: Now, if SUMMIT came over here, however -
[2017-05-08 00:04:53 UTC] biggershekel: kek the destiny fanboys are cracking and are getting salty af
[2017-05-08 00:04:55 UTC] zahvone: Phil would HAVE to take that.
[2017-05-08 00:04:58 UTC] alumpymoose: He just wanted to talk
[2017-05-08 00:05:00 UTC] zahvone: @pcgamehunter DEAL.
[2017-05-08 00:05:02 UTC] waveow: kevindeleonisscum i agree with you but just having a convo isnt going to do anything
[2017-05-08 00:05:06 UTC] destiny: wait what's going on in here
[2017-05-08 00:05:07 UTC] alumpymoose: Not a big deal imo
[2017-05-08 00:05:09 UTC] yacherdy: @pcgamehunter PogChamp
[2017-05-08 00:05:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Zahvone FutureMan
[2017-05-08 00:05:14 UTC] mxtt10589: @Alumpymoose then do it when he wasn't in the middle of streaming
[2017-05-08 00:05:17 UTC] bootycheekwarrior: @Destiny PogChamp
[2017-05-08 00:05:18 UTC] daddi_boi: PogChamp
[2017-05-08 00:05:21 UTC] knyghty: he only wanted to save you a bunch of money I mean, what's the problem
[2017-05-08 00:05:22 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Destiny Returns
[2017-05-08 00:05:23 UTC] yacherdy: @Zahvone SeemsGood
[2017-05-08 00:05:24 UTC] pcgamehunter: See you're VP now @YaCherdy
[2017-05-08 00:05:35 UTC] zahvone: dspSexy dspSexy
[2017-05-08 00:05:41 UTC] thetruthowhy: when live?
[2017-05-08 00:05:42 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: @zaita that advice doesn't apply to me, but Phil's in a tight financial position right now. For him, I don't think the risk is worth it
[2017-05-08 00:05:53 UTC] zahvone: @Thetruthowhy Stream just ended :(
[2017-05-08 00:05:54 UTC] biggershekel: Damn Destiny finished pounding out his daughter already?
[2017-05-08 00:06:04 UTC] biggershekel: lightning speed
[2017-05-08 00:06:06 UTC] yacherdy: jeez
[2017-05-08 00:06:06 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: @ZaitaNZ He doesn't need the alt-right brigading him on top of everyone else rn
[2017-05-08 00:06:08 UTC] zahvone: @Biggershekel Seriously, stop. Please.
[2017-05-08 00:06:16 UTC] ohuken: didnt dsp also say he gets financial advice from a dean of a connecticut school?
[2017-05-08 00:06:25 UTC] mxtt10589: yes
[2017-05-08 00:06:29 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: Biggershekel Wanna hop on and stream and debate that? 🤔
[2017-05-08 00:06:33 UTC] thetruthowhy: ty
[2017-05-08 00:06:49 UTC] waveow: Ohuken thats a good thing tho help isnt bad lol
[2017-05-08 00:06:54 UTC] biggershekel: @zahvone Man I am just warning DSP not to get involved with an admitted pedo
[2017-05-08 00:07:05 UTC] jcobber: @Biggershekel is there a source for that
[2017-05-08 00:07:05 UTC] zahvone: @Biggershekel I don't think he will man, honestly I don't.
[2017-05-08 00:07:09 UTC] ohuken: yeh im saying he doesnt need advice from some random streamer
[2017-05-08 00:07:15 UTC] biggershekel: @dark Nah he would kick me and have a tism like he did with naked ape
[2017-05-08 00:07:16 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: Biggershekel Can you back up those claims?
[2017-05-08 00:07:24 UTC] zaitanz: ok. I can say that buying a new car is often a lot more costly than buying recently used. Usually a lot more expensive. And leasing is always a bad idea unless you're a business
[2017-05-08 00:07:26 UTC] sparky0589: @Biggershekel you're aware he doesn't have a daughter, right?
[2017-05-08 00:07:28 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: N A K E D A P E LUL
[2017-05-08 00:07:38 UTC] zaitanz: Same idea @Destiny had, but I'm not him; or a streamer
[2017-05-08 00:07:42 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Destiny what's happening is you need to learn to use email brah Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:07:53 UTC] pcgamehunter: And stop having your follows spam other people
[2017-05-08 00:07:56 UTC] destiny: I just wanted to talk to DSP because I've heard him talk about different financial things that he has some misconceptions on.
[2017-05-08 00:07:59 UTC] daddi_boi: @Biggershekel sounds a lot like slander
[2017-05-08 00:08:06 UTC] vpzneox: erm..
[2017-05-08 00:08:13 UTC] alumpymoose: 35 year old man that turns off his stream at the first sight of human contact :/
[2017-05-08 00:08:14 UTC] waveow: Biggershekel admitted pedo o.o ?
[2017-05-08 00:08:15 UTC] vpzneox: I'm in the Weird part of Twitch again.
[2017-05-08 00:08:18 UTC] destiny: Buying a new car atm is absolutely a horrible financial decision for him and I think it'd be sad to see him get roped into a 6 year loan on something when he could spend half the money and get something just a good.
[2017-05-08 00:08:21 UTC] destiny: That's all, m80's. :^)
[2017-05-08 00:08:24 UTC] yacherdy: lel
[2017-05-08 00:08:29 UTC] zahvone: @Destiny How did you even manage to get that name?
[2017-05-08 00:08:30 UTC] theycallmejimbob: this is fine RalpherZ 🔥
[2017-05-08 00:08:33 UTC] knyghty: TIL being dean of some college means you know how to be a smart consumer
[2017-05-08 00:08:37 UTC] bootycheekwarrior: wow Destiny, such an attention whore. get out of here SwiftRage Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:08:38 UTC] destiny: Zahvone I've been live-streaming for almost 8 years.
[2017-05-08 00:08:38 UTC] yacherdy: lol jimbob i see you lurking
[2017-05-08 00:08:38 UTC] biggershekel: Damn Destiny give your daughter a break
[2017-05-08 00:08:53 UTC] zahvone: Holy shit. 8 Years dude? My lord.
[2017-05-08 00:08:53 UTC] daddi_boi: @Biggershekel stfu dude
[2017-05-08 00:09:01 UTC] waveow: Biggershekel ?? lul doesnt even have one
[2017-05-08 00:09:02 UTC] sparky0589: @Zahvone he was one of the original streamers way back on justintv. He's been around a LONG time

[2017-05-08 00:09:19 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Destiny yes the metaphorical mob with pitchforks was here to just talk. Maybe next time come alone ?
[2017-05-08 00:09:24 UTC] mxtt10589: darksydephil@hotmail.com is phil's email
[2017-05-08 00:09:26 UTC] mxtt10589: damn

[2017-05-08 00:09:30 UTC] waveow: Biggershekel dsp is that you ? LOL you made a new account
[2017-05-08 00:09:44 UTC] podusmonens: mob with pitchforks?
[2017-05-08 00:09:45 UTC] pcgamehunter: You're verified this is a small chat, no need to bring others here and spam the whole fucking chat
[2017-05-08 00:09:47 UTC] destiny: pcgamehunter I can't really help it if people follow me around, we were just listening to a YT video so people came here
[2017-05-08 00:09:48 UTC] daddi_boi: @Destiny yeah dsp gonna dsp though
[2017-05-08 00:09:50 UTC] podusmonens: what are you talking about?
[2017-05-08 00:09:57 UTC] podusmonens: what mob? they were asking nicely
[2017-05-08 00:09:58 UTC] areyoushivering: lol, writing an email =running through hoops
[2017-05-08 00:10:01 UTC] mxtt10589: he's doing gameplay on stream and not much else
[2017-05-08 00:10:03 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Destiny I wonder how they knew you were here huh ?
[2017-05-08 00:10:09 UTC] duderito2: It would be running through hoops to send an email FailFish
[2017-05-08 00:10:18 UTC] zaitanz: @pcgamehunter someone linked a YT video of DSP he watched
[2017-05-08 00:10:24 UTC] zaitanz: Because of bad financial advice
[2017-05-08 00:10:31 UTC] pcgamehunter: FailFish
[2017-05-08 00:10:33 UTC] destiny: pcgamehunter they came before I did.
[2017-05-08 00:10:38 UTC] yacherdy: ree
[2017-05-08 00:10:38 UTC] biggershekel: You would "run through hoops" to pick up an underaged girl, but not for an e-mail?
[2017-05-08 00:10:42 UTC] destiny: They saw he was streaming and started talking about him in chat.
[2017-05-08 00:10:45 UTC] zahvone: @Biggershekel I told you to stop.
[2017-05-08 00:10:47 UTC] biggershekel: Desi pls

[2017-05-08 00:12:20 UTC] waveow: Biggershekel you should get on discord with him and express your views Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:12:22 UTC] zahvone: I'm not quite sure what you're talking about ;o
[2017-05-08 00:12:46 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Destiny you can just send him a basic email of what you want, and talk to him in private. If you don't want to do that, it's over and done with.
[2017-05-08 00:12:49 UTC] podusmonens: "crazy followers"

[2017-05-08 00:13:13 UTC] podusmonens: talking in private is no fun
[2017-05-08 00:13:14 UTC] zaitanz: @pcgamehunter good work protecting DSP from making a good financial decision bro. SJW

[2017-05-08 00:14:14 UTC] yacherdy: :D
[2017-05-08 00:14:31 UTC] zahvone: EVERYONE should buy a used car unless they can afford a new one.

[2017-05-08 00:15:55 UTC] sparky0589: @pcgamehunter I mean anytime any decently large streamer listens to another streamer's stuff I'm sure a small portion of their chat spills over into their room if they are streaming. There's not much they can do to prevent idiots being idiots.
[2017-05-08 00:15:56 UTC] destiny: I wasn't "raiding" your stream, I never even had it on my main monitor.

[2017-05-08 00:15:57 UTC] yacherdy: MingLee
[2017-05-08 00:15:58 UTC] pcgamehunter: @daddi_boi even if that's completely true, he's still incompetent, because somehow he said his followers got here first, meaning he was here only because they were first
[2017-05-08 00:15:59 UTC] zahvone: The weather is good right now, eh @YaCherdy ?
[2017-05-08 00:16:04 UTC] yacherdy: SeemsGood

[2017-05-08 00:16:19 UTC] daddi_boi: @pcgamehunter so much butthurt
[2017-05-08 00:16:20 UTC] darksydephil: 1. i don't want to talk about a car

[2017-05-08 00:16:41 UTC] podusmonens: you can go on his stream
[2017-05-08 00:16:41 UTC] destiny: I figured the number 1 point out because I think you're too stubborn to ever consider you're wrong about anything, I just wanted to help, m8.
[2017-05-08 00:16:48 UTC] destiny: It makes no difference to me. You had more to gain off the interaction than I did.

[2017-05-08 00:17:04 UTC] darksydephil: my streams are for gameplay with my viewers. thats it. maybe some random chat with them. not talking car financing with other streamers. honestly having this conversation is absurd
[2017-05-08 00:17:10 UTC] destiny: But buying a new car, especially in your financial situation, is absolutely disastrous, and you've made some key errors in analyzing the reasons for buying a new car that it'd help to address.
[2017-05-08 00:17:27 UTC] darksydephil: that's fabulous
[2017-05-08 00:17:31 UTC] destiny: Sure thing, m8, different people do different things on streams, if all you want to do is talk about gameplay you could just leave it at that instead of getting ass-blasted for no reason.
[2017-05-08 00:17:31 UTC] zahvone: Alright,
[2017-05-08 00:17:33 UTC] darksydephil: go talk to your viewers about those reasons

[2017-05-08 00:20:40 UTC] zahvone: So delicious and smooth, very relaxing stuff.
[2017-05-08 00:20:54 UTC] darksydephil: this just in folks! on Tuesday instead of playing a game, i'm going to talk about how another random streamer could do his beard grooming better. and then we'll all jump to his chat and demand to talk about it! lol. but seriously, how people act like this on the regular is just baffling to me. probably because i'm 35 and way past acting like that
[2017-05-08 00:21:11 UTC] vokunkrahsil: dsp you are a moron
[2017-05-08 00:21:12 UTC] darksydephil: i just focus on my own shit and having fun with games
[2017-05-08 00:21:28 UTC] georgetdawson: I didn't know @darksydephil stays in chat after stream
[2017-05-08 00:21:30 UTC] zahvone: @DarksydePhil It's also because you're still "the new guy" on the block. Raids are quite common amongst streamers, actually
[2017-05-08 00:21:40 UTC] zahvone: @georgetdawson He's in here 24/7.
[2017-05-08 00:21:49 UTC] georgetdawson: Awesome!

[2017-05-08 00:21:50 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: DarksydePhil Might sound weird to you, but streamers on twitch do this all the time. You're the one attributing maliciousness to it.
[2017-05-08 00:21:50 UTC] podusmonens: I don't think it's tabu to invite a fellow streamer to a talk
[2017-05-08 00:22:05 UTC] podusmonens: it's all about the community
[2017-05-08 00:22:06 UTC] batzera: Raids help you get more followers though, it's not a bad thing
[2017-05-08 00:22:09 UTC] pcgamehunter: Trump: PCGAYHUNTER you're stupid, you're sad, low energy, you spam stupid messages, they're horrible. Even Anderson Cooper doesn't want you. My messages are tremendous, believe me I have millions of fans on twitter, you have nothing, SAD!"
[2017-05-08 00:22:10 UTC] yacherdy: :)
[2017-05-08 00:22:13 UTC] zahvone: It really depends on the format of the person streaming, though
[2017-05-08 00:22:14 UTC] darksydephil: the best part is saying "but it would benefit you because you have less viewers!" sure, it'll benefit me and i wont get to play the game im here to play, and get distracted to talk about something i dont even care about. sounds like a great benefit lol
[2017-05-08 00:22:14 UTC] deep_drive: raids are incredibly immature zahvone
[2017-05-08 00:22:16 UTC] salamanca32: what is building connections and having a fun discussions that could lead to having new viewers nathanThinking
[2017-05-08 00:22:21 UTC] georgetdawson: Depends on the intention of the raid
[2017-05-08 00:22:39 UTC] zahvone: @Deep_Drive I've never experienced one, so I'm unsure. From what I'm to understand it usually occurs when one streamer goes offline, yes?
[2017-05-08 00:22:40 UTC] jwalker70: stream over?
[2017-05-08 00:22:43 UTC] daviddedavidson: you dont care about the car?

[2017-05-08 00:22:47 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: DarksydePhil He didn't necessitate that you talk right now, it could have been whenever you were free, again.
[2017-05-08 00:22:47 UTC] podusmonens: you could do it now, Phil. you're not streaming games now. just hear out the guy, it won't hurt
[2017-05-08 00:22:52 UTC] yacherdy: *burps* ooof
[2017-05-08 00:22:52 UTC] darksydephil: i dont find car purchases a "fun discussion" at all really
[2017-05-08 00:23:01 UTC] knyghty: but you already spent time talking about it
[2017-05-08 00:23:06 UTC] waveow: DarksydePhil we know you dont care. thats why youre in the hole youre in atm LUL
[2017-05-08 00:23:13 UTC] zahvone: @DarksydePhil But the real question Phil - is does it have big enough cup holders?
[2017-05-08 00:23:18 UTC] yacherdy: I don't know how to change a tire on a car
[2017-05-08 00:23:18 UTC] bethebaby: @DarksydePhil Phil, man you've still got that Youtuber mentality. This is what streamers do; they talk. They talk about things that have NOTHING to do with the game. That's just what they do.
[2017-05-08 00:23:20 UTC] yacherdy: :(
[2017-05-08 00:23:25 UTC] boxman222: I really do not understand how you are upset about being raided for any reason. Any other twitch streamer both big and small would be grateful to get extra viewers that might actually end up hanging around and one day maybe even sub. And even if none of them sticks around it would put your stream much higher on rank, which leads to more viewers finding your stream
[2017-05-08 00:23:28 UTC] pcgamehunter: The internet, where people who read a wikipedia page are called experts Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:23:34 UTC] batzera: @DarksydePhil if he has something nice to say you could benefit though. if it turns out to be a waste you can just leave
[2017-05-08 00:23:38 UTC] boxman222: it is just how things are done on twitch these days

[2017-05-08 00:24:05 UTC] vpzneox: Ok, I kinda understood what's going on now from the bits and pieces

[2017-05-08 00:25:31 UTC] vpzneox: seems like dsp just didn't Want to talk about car issue when he was playing- which is fine, but why not talk to him now? I mean, he said he's been streaming for 8 years now, you might have a lot in common! Just my opinion there, but it's not just about car issue, u know
[2017-05-08 00:25:31 UTC] zahvone: :D
[2017-05-08 00:25:32 UTC] georgetdawson: @bootycheekwarrior he's trashing him on his stream right now. Not helping

[2017-05-08 00:26:11 UTC] zahvone: I think we should all have a community event sometime.
[2017-05-08 00:26:16 UTC] savagebeast7097: phil is just doing his own thing

[2017-05-08 00:26:31 UTC] yacherdy: o shit
[2017-05-08 00:26:35 UTC] zahvone: On days when Phil is offline for the day, we could have stream events where we stream for charity, or just to have fun together.
[2017-05-08 00:26:37 UTC] deep_drive: If you want to promote another streamer host them, don't try and bombard them with spam.

[2017-05-08 00:27:04 UTC] batzera: Destiny didn't bombard anyone with spam though, he just has some stupid followers

[2017-05-08 00:27:10 UTC] jcobber: @Deep_Drive you realize hosting a streamer usually involves spamming the hell out of their chat, right?
[2017-05-08 00:27:13 UTC] sirjackfrost: He's not looking to promote him though
[2017-05-08 00:27:23 UTC] boxman222: BatZera: that is what a raid is about..
[2017-05-08 00:27:26 UTC] boxman222: it is normal
[2017-05-08 00:27:26 UTC] georgetdawson: It's confusing because he is sort of trashing him but then at the same time he does want to speak to him and help him in a way. Mega confusing
[2017-05-08 00:27:26 UTC] knyghty: DSP doesn't want help though - he might find out he's wrong about something
[2017-05-08 00:27:35 UTC] yacherdy: everyone has their own good and bad, it's just how you learn from them :)
[2017-05-08 00:27:38 UTC] yacherdy: idk
[2017-05-08 00:27:48 UTC] yacherdy: it sounded good
[2017-05-08 00:27:54 UTC] podusmonens: it doesn't hurt to just hear out the guy's arguments
[2017-05-08 00:27:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: YaCherdy 24 hour Super Meatboy redemption run hype SwiftRage
[2017-05-08 00:28:00 UTC] zahvone: Phil is very set in his ways. We all know this to be fact. He's admitted this - but he's able to change if he thinks it'll help.
[2017-05-08 00:28:02 UTC] vpzneox: SirJackFrost , well Unwillingly Destiny already promoted Dsp- and Dsp promoted destiny, in a way, by mentioning each other in their streams?!
[2017-05-08 00:28:04 UTC] yacherdy: jimbob SwiftRage
[2017-05-08 00:28:06 UTC] zahvone: He's listened to fans a lot, a LOT over the years.
[2017-05-08 00:28:08 UTC] deep_drive: uhhhhh no you don't need to spam their chat unless you want to be an asshole Jcobber
[2017-05-08 00:28:17 UTC] yacherdy: I'm still repairing my controller jimbob, still a bit sticky
[2017-05-08 00:28:17 UTC] pcgamehunter: Yes, when a large group of people derail someones stream chat, ITS NORMAL for that person to drop everything to talk to the cause of the disruption
[2017-05-08 00:28:25 UTC] pcgamehunter: OF COURSE
[2017-05-08 00:28:26 UTC] boxman222: Zahvone: too bad it is usually too late by then
[2017-05-08 00:28:27 UTC] pcgamehunter: FailFish
[2017-05-08 00:28:28 UTC] podusmonens: the stream wasn't derailed
[2017-05-08 00:28:29 UTC] vpzneox: so why not see it as an opportunity (twitter or not), rather than a distraction?
[2017-05-08 00:28:29 UTC] zahvone: @YaCherdy Did you get some hope seed? ;)
[2017-05-08 00:28:43 UTC] yacherdy: DBstyle
[2017-05-08 00:28:47 UTC] bethebaby: Uh yeah it really is. This is streamer culture. This is what they do. Except Phil.
[2017-05-08 00:28:51 UTC] zahvone: @boxman222 Better late than never. Knowledge is very valuable and some people just need to verify it for themselves.
[2017-05-08 00:28:56 UTC] daviddedavidson: typically streamers say "thanks for the raid" at least. It was common place before hosting
[2017-05-08 00:28:56 UTC] pcgamehunter: stream chat dragin, here borrow my glasses
[2017-05-08 00:29:09 UTC] yacherdy: I think this was a good bonding experience
[2017-05-08 00:29:15 UTC] zahvone: Indeed.
[2017-05-08 00:29:16 UTC] podusmonens: pcgamehunter every time me, cherd, bethe and others talk about something other than the game do we derail stre stream?
[2017-05-08 00:29:25 UTC] podusmonens: the*
[2017-05-08 00:29:27 UTC] vpzneox: it's not like you have to stop streaming, and all - but you can still drop the message afterwards
[2017-05-08 00:29:28 UTC] pcgamehunter: No we don't spam talk to destiny
[2017-05-08 00:29:30 UTC] daddi_boi: @Zahvone don't think that approach has done much good
[2017-05-08 00:29:34 UTC] boxman222: Zahvone: well.. by the point phil would change when it comes to for example raids, then there is a good chance he would have scared any streamer from doing so
[2017-05-08 00:29:37 UTC] jcobber: @Deep_Drive Every streamer I've ever watched host another stream has the people in chat jump into their and go X RAID and spam emotes when they arrive, it's twitch culture
[2017-05-08 00:29:45 UTC] soulrider95: For all DSP rails on ATLUS about "internet culture" he sure doesn't understand it Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:30:15 UTC] zahvone: @boxman222 and that's completely fine. That's an example of a learning experience. I'm not defending it, but it's good to look at another perspective if possible.
[2017-05-08 00:30:22 UTC] georgetdawson: I confuse
[2017-05-08 00:30:24 UTC] vpzneox: DavidDeDavidson, Phil is quite new to Modern twitch streams, so that's actually understandable he might not understand the raids- And I don't think it even was Destiny's intention to "raid" him as such
[2017-05-08 00:30:40 UTC] boxman222: Zahvone: he is kind of out of time sadly
[2017-05-08 00:30:44 UTC] zahvone: @daddi_boi Maybe he's not pewdiepie or summit, but he's still able to do this "full time', yeah? There is, and will always be, room for improvement.
[2017-05-08 00:30:51 UTC] pcgamehunter: Welp I'm done here, I trolled morons and made Zahvone stream president, so I'm done today Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:30:56 UTC] boxman222: he cannot continue to wait years to change
[2017-05-08 00:30:58 UTC] georgetdawson: Yeah he was just watching him on his stream and people followed
[2017-05-08 00:30:58 UTC] yacherdy: later pc :D
[2017-05-08 00:31:00 UTC] daviddedavidson: That is very true. Plus the sudden spike by +100% of you audience can be quite dramatic
[2017-05-08 00:31:10 UTC] sirjackfrost: @Vpzneox For sure, and I'm sure Destiny doesn't mind the two-way promotions even if it's a lesser trade for himself - but regardless, the goal isn't the promote DSP, which is why I'm saying that others shouldn't expect him to host DSP randomly
[2017-05-08 00:31:11 UTC] zahvone: @boxman222 I'm not so sure about that - he still has a following
[2017-05-08 00:31:12 UTC] daddi_boi: @Zahvone yeah but if were following trends here it hasn't done much good at all
[2017-05-08 00:31:15 UTC] podusmonens: more like + 300%
[2017-05-08 00:31:19 UTC] zahvone: @pcgamehunter Talk to you later! Thanks for the fun chats.
[2017-05-08 00:31:22 UTC] austinashfield: Why are you guys trying to shove this down his throat?
[2017-05-08 00:31:28 UTC] boxman222: if he wants his twitch streams to grow he really needs to start acting like fulltime streamer right away
[2017-05-08 00:31:36 UTC] bethebaby: Because we're trying to HELP him.
[2017-05-08 00:31:39 UTC] deep_drive: Oh, so it's twitch culture do derail someone elses entire streamchat and stream Jcobber...guess we're not putting up with that bullshit. Keep that culture to yourself
[2017-05-08 00:31:40 UTC] pcgamehunter: haha ye cya cherdy, zahvone I'm off to bed
[2017-05-08 00:31:55 UTC] zahvone: @daddi_boi Well, you can only do so much from following trends anyway, right? Youtube is a prime example of that. :( Twitch has a lot of creative freedom that still needs to be tapped.
[2017-05-08 00:31:56 UTC] pcgamehunter: oh and cya deep, don't bother debating here is useless Kappa /
[2017-05-08 00:31:59 UTC] yacherdy: HEYgUYS
[2017-05-08 00:32:02 UTC] podusmonens: as a viewer of both streamers I wanna see them talk. especially if it's going to be a calm and argumentative convo
[2017-05-08 00:32:06 UTC] vpzneox: @SirJackFrost true, but that is Why it's worth for both of them to just PM each other, and get the most out of situation
[2017-05-08 00:32:06 UTC] daddi_boi: @Deep_Drive stop with the pretentiousness, yes that's twitch culture. go into any semi popular stream
[2017-05-08 00:32:06 UTC] deep_drive: ya leaving pcgamehunter ?
[2017-05-08 00:32:09 UTC] zahvone: Ayy cherds
[2017-05-08 00:32:11 UTC] vpzneox: don't you think?
[2017-05-08 00:32:12 UTC] podusmonens: what's wrong with that
[2017-05-08 00:32:20 UTC] yacherdy: woah
[2017-05-08 00:32:24 UTC] zahvone: @podusmonens Nothing at all
[2017-05-08 00:32:27 UTC] yacherdy: caps fail
[2017-05-08 00:32:30 UTC] yacherdy: HeyGuys there we go
[2017-05-08 00:32:32 UTC] pcgamehunter: yeah I'm done wasting time with the fart Destiny left here Kappa, bye Kappa /
[2017-05-08 00:32:35 UTC] bethebaby: Phil's going to have to accept it if he wants to stay around @Deep_Drive
[2017-05-08 00:32:41 UTC] zahvone: @YaCherdy I read it as a surfer guy from rocket power
[2017-05-08 00:32:46 UTC] yacherdy: :D
[2017-05-08 00:32:50 UTC] deep_drive: No wonder PHil had beef with twitch...you guys are a bunch of assholes
[2017-05-08 00:32:58 UTC] yacherdy: deep :(
[2017-05-08 00:33:02 UTC] podusmonens: what?
[2017-05-08 00:33:11 UTC] daddi_boi: @Deep_Drive lmao
[2017-05-08 00:33:15 UTC] bethebaby: There's nothing malicious about it. It's intended to be FUN.
[2017-05-08 00:33:16 UTC] zahvone: @Deep_Drive Don't let them get to you. It's all good.
[2017-05-08 00:33:20 UTC] soulrider95: Deep_Drive just cuz you dont understand it LUL
[2017-05-08 00:33:25 UTC] toodammhigh: the only thing destiny actually wanted was to prevent him from doing a bad finantial decision, but ofcourse viewers are going to come spam the chat, you cant control what your viewers do on another channel
[2017-05-08 00:33:30 UTC] pcgamehunter: I don't know who deep is talking to rite now lol
[2017-05-08 00:33:39 UTC] daddi_boi: a bunch of assholes apparently
[2017-05-08 00:33:42 UTC] sirjackfrost: @Vpzneox I agree, but twitter is Destiny's primary avenue for getting that started and that's a no-go - The harder it is for him to contact DSP, the less likely he is to do it, especially if it's this much of a hassle
[2017-05-08 00:33:43 UTC] yacherdy: I hope I'm not on deep's shit list
[2017-05-08 00:33:47 UTC] zahvone: @Toodammhigh That is true! I agree - you can't control a fanbase - but you can definitely encourage them to stop.
[2017-05-08 00:33:48 UTC] yacherdy: feelsbadman
[2017-05-08 00:33:49 UTC] jcobber: @Deep_Drive you can ignore the culture of the site you're on as long as you want, but it's not going to encourage growth of the stream by being intentionally antagonistic. Streaming culture has been around for much longer than DSP, he's only harming himself by fighting it
[2017-05-08 00:33:50 UTC] deep_drive: all the wanna be raiders pcgamehunter
[2017-05-08 00:33:55 UTC] pcgamehunter: Well whatever EleGiggle
[2017-05-08 00:33:58 UTC] pcgamehunter: Oh ok
[2017-05-08 00:34:01 UTC] pcgamehunter: I thought you got mad at me
[2017-05-08 00:34:07 UTC] austinashfield: Honestly for some reason I have the feeling that these people from destiny's chat in here are actually all just Destiny Lol.
[2017-05-08 00:34:08 UTC] pcgamehunter: Sry continue I'm off bye :P
[2017-05-08 00:34:12 UTC] toodammhigh: Zahvone thats also true
[2017-05-08 00:34:21 UTC] zahvone: @pcgamehunter Have a great night
[2017-05-08 00:34:24 UTC] zahvone: Not too great though!
[2017-05-08 00:34:27 UTC] zahvone: I'm watching.
[2017-05-08 00:34:29 UTC] pcgamehunter: you too Kappa /
[2017-05-08 00:34:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bye pcgamehunter tc
[2017-05-08 00:34:29 UTC] sirjackfrost: yeah, I'm sure we're all destiny even though he's streaming a playing a game right now
[2017-05-08 00:34:30 UTC] zahvone: dspGlitch dspGlitch dspGlitch
[2017-05-08 00:34:33 UTC] podusmonens: bye felicia
[2017-05-08 00:34:34 UTC] pcgamehunter: Oh you son of a Keepo
[2017-05-08 00:34:35 UTC] deep_drive: bye pcgamehunter
[2017-05-08 00:34:37 UTC] pcgamehunter: @theycallmejimbob bye
[2017-05-08 00:34:37 UTC] zahvone: Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:34:39 UTC] knyghty: @AustinAshfield he must have 8 fucking hands then as he's also playing factorio right now
[2017-05-08 00:34:43 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Deep_Drive babye Keepo /
[2017-05-08 00:34:52 UTC] austinashfield: You all sound similar so I don't know. OpieOP
[2017-05-08 00:34:53 UTC] vpzneox: @SirJackFrost Hm, I see, well still if they Wanted to, they'd be able to find common ground.... it's all in their hands, rly
[2017-05-08 00:35:14 UTC] knyghty: what, similar, like, intelligent?
[2017-05-08 00:35:26 UTC] zahvone: Anyway, everyone I'm glad we're able to have a conversation without insulti-
[2017-05-08 00:35:34 UTC] yacherdy: MingLee
[2017-05-08 00:35:36 UTC] zahvone: Okay then.
[2017-05-08 00:35:52 UTC] sirjackfrost: @Vpzneox I agree - as an outsider though, right now there looks to be very little benefit for Destiny to continue pursuing this if it's this annoying, lol
[2017-05-08 00:35:54 UTC] austinashfield: @Knyghty Or he just types all his messages first then sends them from the different accounts as fast as possible
[2017-05-08 00:36:08 UTC] zahvone: Hey, guys. Let's take this to the forums, no? :p
[2017-05-08 00:36:10 UTC] knyghty: I guess but that seems a bit... conspiractorial?
[2017-05-08 00:36:28 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it was me AustinAshfield it was me all along
[2017-05-08 00:36:32 UTC] yacherdy: :o
[2017-05-08 00:36:34 UTC] knyghty: guy with 3000 viewers, but nah, everyone in chat must be him...
[2017-05-08 00:36:35 UTC] zahvone: Oh no
[2017-05-08 00:36:43 UTC] zahvone: It's STEVE fucking JONES :O
[2017-05-08 00:36:53 UTC] vpzneox: @SirJackFrost I'm kinda outsider too, I mean I watched dsp for a while, some games, started watching Destiny (from today), they both seem entertaining in their own ways
[2017-05-08 00:37:00 UTC] deep_drive: The forums where Phil bans everyone zahvone? Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:37:04 UTC] yacherdy: uh oh
[2017-05-08 00:37:12 UTC] zahvone: @Deep_Drive Well I mean, why not? :p
[2017-05-08 00:37:45 UTC] bethebaby: Yeah because that's totally not a toxic circlejerk echo chamber.
[2017-05-08 00:37:58 UTC] austinashfield: You all just sound way too much like a hive mind so you know.
[2017-05-08 00:38:03 UTC] zahvone: Listen, okay
[2017-05-08 00:38:06 UTC] yacherdy: *sips beer*
[2017-05-08 00:38:08 UTC] yacherdy: ahhhh
[2017-05-08 00:38:16 UTC] knyghty: @AustinAshfield why the insults though?
[2017-05-08 00:38:18 UTC] yacherdy: ooof
[2017-05-08 00:38:19 UTC] vpzneox: Austin, welcome, Honey!
[2017-05-08 00:38:23 UTC] deep_drive: this oughta be good
[2017-05-08 00:38:30 UTC] bethebaby: @YaCherdy Ya gotta drink whiskey! That's some rookie shit!!! SwiftRage SwiftRage
[2017-05-08 00:38:38 UTC] knyghty: I don't even follow Destiny, I was only on his stream because he was talking with ContraPoints earlier
[2017-05-08 00:38:41 UTC] zahvone: If I have to make a third party website, to properly start a topical debate forum, I fucking will.
[2017-05-08 00:38:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: what craft beer are you drinking YaCherdy ?
[2017-05-08 00:38:44 UTC] zahvone: It'll be beautiful
[2017-05-08 00:38:45 UTC] knyghty: yet somehow I'm a hive mind
[2017-05-08 00:38:46 UTC] vpzneox: I choose my words carefully ^^ I know.
[2017-05-08 00:38:50 UTC] zahvone: Selsun blue ads everywhere

[2017-05-08 00:39:28 UTC] yacherdy: Oregon made
[2017-05-08 00:39:28 UTC] podusmonens: i missed the contrapoints talk
[2017-05-08 00:39:53 UTC] yacherdy: Errnonent could probably back me up in that
[2017-05-08 00:39:53 UTC] podusmonens: origen
[2017-05-08 00:39:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Sounds expensive and pretentious YaCherdy :P
[2017-05-08 00:39:59 UTC] yacherdy: origen and kintucky
[2017-05-08 00:40:04 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob naaaah :p
[2017-05-08 00:40:06 UTC] austinashfield: @Knyghty Less of an insult and more of me just saying all of these accounts personality's seem the same.
[2017-05-08 00:40:37 UTC] deep_drive: good stuff cherdy
[2017-05-08 00:40:43 UTC] yacherdy: deep SeemsGood
[2017-05-08 00:40:44 UTC] deep_drive: don't listen to jimbob
[2017-05-08 00:40:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :( sorry YaCherdy
[2017-05-08 00:40:54 UTC] deep_drive: he doesn't understand quality oregon beer
[2017-05-08 00:40:58 UTC] yacherdy: lol
[2017-05-08 00:40:59 UTC] podusmonens: jeembahb the meanie
[2017-05-08 00:41:04 UTC] yacherdy: poor jimmy
[2017-05-08 00:41:07 UTC] zahvone: The fact that this chat is still here
[2017-05-08 00:41:09 UTC] zahvone: and kicking
[2017-05-08 00:41:12 UTC] austinashfield: This is just seriously weird.
[2017-05-08 00:41:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: someday I'll move to Kentucky and drink that craft beer YaCherdy
[2017-05-08 00:41:17 UTC] zahvone: THIS LONG after a done stream
[2017-05-08 00:41:22 UTC] deep_drive: @Zahvone is it gonna be called thekingofhopeseed dot com?
[2017-05-08 00:41:29 UTC] yacherdy: jimbob NotLikeThis
[2017-05-08 00:41:33 UTC] podusmonens: i'm hoping phil will change his mind
[2017-05-08 00:41:36 UTC] yacherdy: you'll be drinking Pabst jimbob
[2017-05-08 00:41:37 UTC] zahvone: @Deep_Drive Oh yes. Hopeseed dot net
[2017-05-08 00:41:43 UTC] podusmonens: a fool's hope
[2017-05-08 00:41:44 UTC] podusmonens: :(
[2017-05-08 00:42:02 UTC] yacherdy: poor draggy
[2017-05-08 00:42:18 UTC] podusmonens: I cri everitim
[2017-05-08 00:42:20 UTC] knyghty: don't worry, he's very open minded
[2017-05-08 00:42:47 UTC] knyghty: I'm sure he'll see the potential in free exposure and come around
[2017-05-08 00:43:10 UTC] bethebaby: Yeah 4 years from now. Same with direct capture and coming back to Twitch.
[2017-05-08 00:43:17 UTC] podusmonens: :(
[2017-05-08 00:43:27 UTC] boxman222: bethebaby: most likely...
[2017-05-08 00:43:37 UTC] yacherdy: lol
[2017-05-08 00:43:47 UTC] podusmonens: dont antagonize him
[2017-05-08 00:44:00 UTC] soulrider95: He could use some real talk from time to time tbh
[2017-05-08 00:44:32 UTC] bethebaby: What's true is truthful. He's not about to change his mind overnight about streamer culture.
[2017-05-08 00:44:40 UTC] yacherdy: I think the Hate live calls should come back just hopefully not as cringy
[2017-05-08 00:44:58 UTC] deep_drive: If someone wants to contact Phil, just send him an email...it's not that hard
[2017-05-08 00:45:01 UTC] yacherdy: but there was some *decent* talks on there
[2017-05-08 00:45:25 UTC] podusmonens: this would be more than decent
[2017-05-08 00:45:38 UTC] yacherdy: well yeah I'm sure Desinty is well spoken
[2017-05-08 00:45:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I must be out of the loop but I didn't think Phil's next car choice would make a riveting podcast.
[2017-05-08 00:45:43 UTC] deep_drive: the problem with hate live calls is that phil got doxxed because of them
[2017-05-08 00:45:44 UTC] yacherdy: if he's been streaming for 8 years
[2017-05-08 00:45:48 UTC] deep_drive: thats why he got swatted
[2017-05-08 00:45:52 UTC] yacherdy: @Deep_Drive well yeah Skype is a bitch
[2017-05-08 00:46:00 UTC] yacherdy: lol jimbob
[2017-05-08 00:46:02 UTC] deep_drive: and had to change his whole ip adresses
[2017-05-08 00:46:19 UTC] podusmonens: of he maintained his calm with martin shkreli I bet he could handle phil
[2017-05-08 00:46:23 UTC] podusmonens: if*
[2017-05-08 00:46:28 UTC] boxman222: there are other alternatives that does not show ip.. but anyways that is not the real problem anyways
[2017-05-08 00:46:31 UTC] yacherdy: sometimes i wonder why phil doesn't have a VPN, but then again that limits your download/upload speed so
[2017-05-08 00:46:32 UTC] podusmonens: :D
[2017-05-08 00:46:43 UTC] podusmonens: not that I\m comparing the two
[2017-05-08 00:47:08 UTC] austinashfield: Anyways, If you're trying to get phils attention now it's probably not going to work because as you can see he's not looking at chat so your attempts at shoving your opinion down his throat is futile at this point and are basically just talking like a broken record.
[2017-05-08 00:47:14 UTC] boxman222: he could have just been grateful for the raid itself, welcomed the new viewers and just quickly say that he do not want to discuss this during the stream and maybe instead offer to have a little chat afterwards
[2017-05-08 00:47:35 UTC] boxman222: even if it is just over normal chat
[2017-05-08 00:47:39 UTC] knyghty: @AustinAshfield you're assuming we're trying to get his attention
[2017-05-08 00:48:07 UTC] yacherdy: I'm just talkin with ma homies
[2017-05-08 00:48:08 UTC] deep_drive: Yes. He's gonna be grateful that you guys tried to derail his stream...morons
[2017-05-08 00:48:20 UTC] podusmonens: cherd when will you continue GTA VC?
[2017-05-08 00:48:20 UTC] soulrider95: Derail WHAT?
[2017-05-08 00:48:24 UTC] soulrider95: the chat wasn't even talking about the game
[2017-05-08 00:48:31 UTC] boxman222: Deep_Drive: you seem to be as clueless about raids and twitch culture as phil is
[2017-05-08 00:48:31 UTC] soulrider95: you're making no goddamn sense with "derailing stream"
[2017-05-08 00:48:33 UTC] knyghty: @boxman222 idk honestly I think his excuse was kinda lame, like, "oh it's not interesting to talk about my car with someone" when he spent over 20 mins talking about his car...
[2017-05-08 00:48:38 UTC] yacherdy: idk dragin if I do it won't be too soon
[2017-05-08 00:48:41 UTC] yacherdy: i mean wait
[2017-05-08 00:48:45 UTC] podusmonens: :(
[2017-05-08 00:48:46 UTC] boxman222: usually they are much more off topic than this
[2017-05-08 00:48:48 UTC] bethebaby: The whole "derail" thing is just an out-and-out fallacy. They didn't derail shit.
[2017-05-08 00:48:49 UTC] yacherdy: it won't be too far away
[2017-05-08 00:48:52 UTC] yacherdy: whoops
[2017-05-08 00:48:55 UTC] deep_drive: Y'all wanted Phil to talk about cars with your Destiny hero and derail the gameplay
[2017-05-08 00:48:57 UTC] podusmonens: rejected from all sides
[2017-05-08 00:49:02 UTC] yacherdy: sorry the alcohol is talking
[2017-05-08 00:49:30 UTC] austinashfield: @Knyghty Ealier you stated when I asked why you're trying to shove your opinion down his throat was to "help him" so ya. You're trying to.
[2017-05-08 00:49:31 UTC] soulrider95: DERAIL WHAT GAMEPLAY?
[2017-05-08 00:49:33 UTC] deep_drive: the chat WAS talking about the game...until you guys came in
[2017-05-08 00:49:39 UTC] bethebaby: @Deep_Drive Derail the gameplay?! Do chat messages appear in game as text logs now?!?
[2017-05-08 00:49:45 UTC] deep_drive: and tried to fuck with everything
[2017-05-08 00:49:51 UTC] soulrider95: It's Phil complaining about getting oneshot, saying "LOOK OBVIOUS THING" and calling out donations
[2017-05-08 00:49:56 UTC] boxman222: Deep_Drive: read my earlier comment.. he did not have to let it derail his gameplay.. he could have just welcomed the new viewers and give a thank you for the raid while saying he do not want to discuss it DURING the stream
[2017-05-08 00:50:01 UTC] knyghty: @AustinAshfield that was earlier. Time is continuous and things change.
[2017-05-08 00:50:28 UTC] yacherdy: Old Spice Wolfthorn SeemsGood
[2017-05-08 00:50:30 UTC] yacherdy: on point
[2017-05-08 00:50:37 UTC] deep_drive: go back to freedom chat soulrider...you're a sociopath
[2017-05-08 00:50:41 UTC] podusmonens: I like that one cherd
[2017-05-08 00:50:42 UTC] yacherdy: woah
[2017-05-08 00:50:45 UTC] yacherdy: yes dragin
[2017-05-08 00:50:48 UTC] yacherdy: SeemsGood
[2017-05-08 00:50:51 UTC] soulrider95: Says the guy who donated $500 to phil rofl
[2017-05-08 00:51:02 UTC] podusmonens: but it's a bit "sweet" for my taste
[2017-05-08 00:51:06 UTC] boxman222: i seriously think people like Deep_Drive is going to be the end of phil
[2017-05-08 00:51:10 UTC] podusmonens: I usually go for whitewater or lagoon
[2017-05-08 00:51:14 UTC] yacherdy: yeah it almost has a fruit loops scent to it :D
[2017-05-08 00:51:20 UTC] boxman222: you are a big part of why he does not change
[2017-05-08 00:51:21 UTC] deep_drive: Oh so it's MY fault....hahahahahaha
[2017-05-08 00:51:31 UTC] boxman222: you are a big part of it for sure
[2017-05-08 00:51:31 UTC] yacherdy: never tried it dragin will have to
[2017-05-08 00:51:32 UTC] damnjp: wait so, phil got a raid, and he didn't even said "oh thank you for coming, welcome to my stream" or anything?
[2017-05-08 00:51:34 UTC] deep_drive: i can give my money however i want to soulrider95
[2017-05-08 00:51:43 UTC] bethebaby: @Deep_Drive Now you're literally using DSP buzzwords. There are fans, and then there are fucking fanatics. Most people in this chat are fucking fanatics. I'm talking legit dangerous, Koolaid Kult fanatics.
[2017-05-08 00:51:44 UTC] deep_drive: its a nice thing to do
[2017-05-08 00:51:45 UTC] damnjp: aw c'mmon phil...
[2017-05-08 00:51:46 UTC] boxman222: DamnJP; he got mad...
[2017-05-08 00:52:19 UTC] damnjp: aw man, that's a lost chance, he could used that raid
[2017-05-08 00:52:27 UTC] deep_drive: by the way ive given over $600
[2017-05-08 00:52:33 UTC] deep_drive: buy thats irrelevent
[2017-05-08 00:52:39 UTC] podusmonens: buy
[2017-05-08 00:52:41 UTC] podusmonens: Kapa
[2017-05-08 00:52:44 UTC] deep_drive: buzzworrds?
[2017-05-08 00:52:44 UTC] podusmonens: Kappa
[2017-05-08 00:52:48 UTC] bethebaby: @podusmonens Ruined.
[2017-05-08 00:53:03 UTC] deep_drive: All I'm trying to do is enjoy the fucking game that is being played
[2017-05-08 00:53:06 UTC] yacherdy: *sips beer*
[2017-05-08 00:53:08 UTC] yacherdy: oh wait its empty
[2017-05-08 00:53:12 UTC] deep_drive: Is that too much to ask for?
[2017-05-08 00:53:15 UTC] yacherdy: well fuck
[2017-05-08 00:53:31 UTC] deep_drive: better pop another one open cherdy
[2017-05-08 00:53:45 UTC] podusmonens: no deep but you don't have to be so obtuse towards oportunities
[2017-05-08 00:53:46 UTC] yacherdy: I may have to SeemGood
[2017-05-08 00:53:49 UTC] yacherdy: SeemsGood
[2017-05-08 00:53:51 UTC] boxman222: Deep_Drive: and again if he followed my suggestion it would be no more derail of gameplay thank thanking a single subscriber or tip
[2017-05-08 00:54:02 UTC] knyghty: the whole point of twitch is interaction imo and Phil shows he'd rather not interract with chat if it's not 100% on his side, idk how he expects to keep his userbase
[2017-05-08 00:54:14 UTC] boxman222: he could have thanked for the raid and get on with gameplay within seconds
[2017-05-08 00:54:18 UTC] damnjp: but deep_drive, twitch us not just for enjoying the game, is part of it, but not the entirety, ppl come for all the reasons, the game, the streamer, the chat
[2017-05-08 00:54:21 UTC] damnjp: so yeah
[2017-05-08 00:54:25 UTC] zahvone: See
[2017-05-08 00:54:28 UTC] podusmonens: how much time did fans spam phil about twitch?
[2017-05-08 00:54:45 UTC] zahvone: If I stream right now, I'll be autohosted on this channel but I'm nervous af and have nothing good going on. ;o
[2017-05-08 00:54:52 UTC] zahvone: What about you @YaCherdy
[2017-05-08 00:55:08 UTC] bethebaby: Yeah, buzzwords. Like DSP past favorite "sociopaths". No one in this chat knows a fucking thing about the "detractors" beyond what they've been told by Phil, and spoiler alert: Phil has fucking mislead you. Those people(SoK, Tevin, etc), want NOTHING but the best for Phil, but they've got to wade through the knee-deep filth from blind idiots who just shovel money into Phil's coffers and say inane crap like "keep it up Phil, been a fan since 1918. Fuck those trolls!!1#@!"
[2017-05-08 00:55:17 UTC] yacherdy: ha i'd be playing Vice City Zah :D
[2017-05-08 00:55:34 UTC] zahvone: Funny you say that, I have V open up right now
[2017-05-08 00:55:35 UTC] damnjp: lost chance...a bummer, but well what can we do?
[2017-05-08 00:55:35 UTC] podusmonens: for 3 amazing viewers
[2017-05-08 00:55:40 UTC] yacherdy: true dragin
[2017-05-08 00:55:42 UTC] yacherdy: the best
[2017-05-08 00:55:47 UTC] yacherdy: sometimes I get 5
[2017-05-08 00:55:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: do you stream Zahvone any inkling to doing a Super Meat Boy playthrough?
[2017-05-08 00:55:57 UTC] podusmonens: whoa hwoa calm down
[2017-05-08 00:56:11 UTC] yacherdy: i am calm DBstyle
[2017-05-08 00:56:16 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob ...
[2017-05-08 00:56:19 UTC] deep_drive: you want phil to thank you for deriding the chat so instead of talking to him and about the game its just an endless spawn of "talk to destiny about cars"...no that's not benefical to Phil in any way. You all are just attention seeking trying to get off topic.
[2017-05-08 00:56:22 UTC] zahvone: I do stream from time to time, yes. I've wanted to take it a bit more serious lately - I don't own any nintendo product actually.
[2017-05-08 00:56:35 UTC] podusmonens: you get 5 when mfd and bobbi join
[2017-05-08 00:56:42 UTC] podusmonens: bobbi seems to like you
[2017-05-08 00:56:46 UTC] zahvone: @YaCherdy Most I've ever had is...9 I think
[2017-05-08 00:56:52 UTC] zahvone: But regularly I get none. Lol
[2017-05-08 00:56:58 UTC] yacherdy: Zah I'll have to stop by your stream, unfortunately never got a chance to
[2017-05-08 00:57:04 UTC] deep_drive: bethebaby there are no buzzwords from phil...he talks like a normal human being...unlike some of the people in this chat right now
[2017-05-08 00:57:20 UTC] yacherdy: @podusmonens idk she might :(
[2017-05-08 00:57:24 UTC] zahvone: It's all good. I'd like to support anyone here if possible - you seem like a really decent person as well, so that helps lol
[2017-05-08 00:57:26 UTC] deep_drive: even i come to your streams cherdy
[2017-05-08 00:57:27 UTC] damnjp: Deep_Drive, do you watch any other streamers?
[2017-05-08 00:57:37 UTC] yacherdy: oh yes deep you too thank you
[2017-05-08 00:57:38 UTC] podusmonens: slip into the PMs cherd
[2017-05-08 00:57:46 UTC] deep_drive: hardly ever DamnJP
[2017-05-08 00:57:57 UTC] deep_drive: but i think ive been to a couple other streams
[2017-05-08 00:58:00 UTC] yacherdy: I got 40 viewers a couple years ago... MingLee I'm big time
[2017-05-08 00:58:09 UTC] yacherdy: @podusmonens I respect her too much DBstyle
[2017-05-08 00:58:13 UTC] boxman222: Deep_Drive: have you never witnessed a raid before?? that is how all of them are.. usually they just spam a word but this time it was actually kind of relevant to something phil has talked about
[2017-05-08 00:58:18 UTC] podusmonens: play her a nice song on the geetar
[2017-05-08 00:58:18 UTC] damnjp: you should deep, so you can understand why we don't agree with you, just saying
[2017-05-08 00:58:22 UTC] zahvone: 72 followers and literally only my girlfriend shows up
[2017-05-08 00:58:23 UTC] zahvone: Lol
[2017-05-08 00:58:32 UTC] boxman222: after you thank them they usually actually stop
[2017-05-08 00:58:40 UTC] bethebaby: @Deep_Drive It's a lot more beneficial than the usual stupid shit chat talks about, like Kendrick Lamar's new album, fake-ass wrestling, or fucking corn.
[2017-05-08 00:58:47 UTC] boxman222: but instead phil had to attack both the raiders and destiny
[2017-05-08 00:58:50 UTC] soulrider95: WWE LUL
[2017-05-08 00:58:51 UTC] yacherdy: LOL
[2017-05-08 00:58:52 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :( poor YaCherdy
[2017-05-08 00:58:55 UTC] podusmonens: you mean kendrick lamer
[2017-05-08 00:58:55 UTC] deep_drive: yes ive seen raids before boxman222 they come into Phil's stream and start spamming stuff until mods have to put chat in followers only mode
[2017-05-08 00:58:55 UTC] yacherdy: :(
[2017-05-08 00:59:06 UTC] damnjp: raids are pretty beneficial for streamers
[2017-05-08 00:59:08 UTC] soulrider95: Deep_Drive that's just how raids work
[2017-05-08 00:59:17 UTC] boxman222: yeah because he ignored them and then got salty over it
[2017-05-08 00:59:18 UTC] yacherdy: no one likes kendrick lamer
[2017-05-08 00:59:18 UTC] soulrider95: That's how twitch is
[2017-05-08 00:59:20 UTC] yacherdy: :(
[2017-05-08 00:59:26 UTC] zahvone: But Logic though
[2017-05-08 00:59:29 UTC] yacherdy: just me and Many
[2017-05-08 00:59:39 UTC] boxman222: this could have been over within seconds if he had dealt with it like other streamers do
[2017-05-08 01:00:00 UTC] podusmonens: cherd I thought that by showing bobbi you're willing to drop a bad habit at her suggestion was a lowkey move :>
[2017-05-08 01:00:08 UTC] boxman222: and as a bonus he might have had a few extra followers and future subs as well if he made them feel welcome
[2017-05-08 01:00:13 UTC] podusmonens: on her bootay
[2017-05-08 01:00:16 UTC] soulrider95: he could've just said "Oh thanks for the offer, send me an email at <email> and we'll talk after the stream"
[2017-05-08 01:00:17 UTC] boxman222: how is that a bad thing?
[2017-05-08 01:00:21 UTC] soulrider95: but instead he sperged the fuck out
[2017-05-08 01:00:25 UTC] yacherdy: @podusmonens well yeah I suppose so but she truly opened my eyes mang
[2017-05-08 01:00:29 UTC] boxman222: soulrider95: exactly
[2017-05-08 01:00:45 UTC] yacherdy: bobbi is a lifesaver
[2017-05-08 01:00:47 UTC] knyghty: @Deep_Drive, wait, how is it not beneficial to Phil to bring in 3,000 potential subs to the stream? And save him a ton of money on his new car?
[2017-05-08 01:00:48 UTC] podusmonens: and you in turn will open her front door
[2017-05-08 01:00:55 UTC] podusmonens: or chimney
[2017-05-08 01:00:55 UTC] yacherdy: @podusmonens WutFace
[2017-05-08 01:00:59 UTC] yacherdy: no no no
[2017-05-08 01:01:00 UTC] podusmonens: whatever you desire
[2017-05-08 01:01:01 UTC] deep_drive: If you say so boxman222...I thought you guys just came here to be mean
[2017-05-08 01:01:05 UTC] bethebaby: @podusmonens WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2017-05-08 01:01:13 UTC] yacherdy: bobbi is a strong independent woman
[2017-05-08 01:01:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Is Phil's next car purchase that much of a hot topic Knyghty ?
[2017-05-08 01:01:21 UTC] damnjp: he could just said "OH SHIT, A RAID? OH MY GOD! THANKS FOR COMING" and it would be okay
[2017-05-08 01:01:27 UTC] podusmonens: I know
[2017-05-08 01:01:35 UTC] boxman222: i was not even part of the raid... i have been watching phil for years already :P
[2017-05-08 01:01:35 UTC] knyghty: @theycallmejimbob apparently :P
[2017-05-08 01:01:40 UTC] yacherdy: SeemsGood
[2017-05-08 01:01:44 UTC] boxman222: i just think he dealt with it in a horrible way
[2017-05-08 01:02:21 UTC] knyghty: I mean, come on, we can save him hundreds if not thousands of dollars over the lifespan of his loan, I get off on that shit, not getting ripped off by car salesmen is good stuff
[2017-05-08 01:02:30 UTC] damnjp: I guess he might thought "oh those are some trolls" 'cause phil, sometimes, is paranoid
[2017-05-08 01:02:39 UTC] zahvone: Rightly so
[2017-05-08 01:02:44 UTC] zahvone: Have you seen his haters lol
[2017-05-08 01:02:54 UTC] damnjp: actually yes
[2017-05-08 01:03:00 UTC] soulrider95: Who, me?
[2017-05-08 01:03:02 UTC] soulrider95: Kappa
[2017-05-08 01:03:04 UTC] zahvone: I'd like some insight
[2017-05-08 01:03:13 UTC] vpzneox: What did I miss?
[2017-05-08 01:03:39 UTC] vpzneox: I've been away for like 20 mins now chat's still Going on!?
[2017-05-08 01:03:41 UTC] yacherdy: MingLee
[2017-05-08 01:03:44 UTC] zahvone: Yes
[2017-05-08 01:03:45 UTC] yacherdy: Just things

[2017-05-08 01:03:53 UTC] yacherdy: I'm liking this
[2017-05-08 01:03:57 UTC] deep_drive: Yes Vpzneox chat is trying to justify raiding right now
[2017-05-08 01:04:00 UTC] zahvone: People always talk shit about Phil and his fans but his chat is always poppin for a long time after chat
[2017-05-08 01:04:03 UTC] zahvone: stream*
[2017-05-08 01:04:10 UTC] vpzneox: when's the Stream?
[2017-05-08 01:04:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Tuesday :D
[2017-05-08 01:04:19 UTC] yacherdy: Tuesday MingLee
[2017-05-08 01:04:22 UTC] deep_drive: the streams been over for almost 2 hours
[2017-05-08 01:04:24 UTC] knyghty: you say raiding like it's a bad thing for the channel to get exposure?
[2017-05-08 01:04:33 UTC] bethebaby: And Phil and his fans always talk shit about "haters". Yin and Yang.
[2017-05-08 01:04:37 UTC] vpzneox: Zahvone, I know ^_^
[2017-05-08 01:04:37 UTC] zahvone: He just wants to play games, that's it
[2017-05-08 01:04:44 UTC] vpzneox: /me gets some Popcorn.
[2017-05-08 01:04:44 UTC] zahvone: :o
[2017-05-08 01:05:23 UTC] deep_drive: They're not getting the channel "exposure" they just come here to troll and then leave...if the sok came here it wouldn't be beneficial to Phil at all
[2017-05-08 01:05:25 UTC] vpzneox: /me also Gets some cola.
[2017-05-08 01:05:42 UTC] podusmonens: troll?!
[2017-05-08 01:05:45 UTC] soulrider95: Deep_Drive if ONE person stays, that's not a benefit?
[2017-05-08 01:05:46 UTC] yacherdy: uh oh
[2017-05-08 01:05:51 UTC] knyghty: I didn't really see any trolling
[2017-05-08 01:05:59 UTC] soulrider95: If he gets pushed up the directory and more randoms come in, that's not a benefit?
[2017-05-08 01:06:19 UTC] boxman222: how can you not undertstand that if phil made them feel welcome they might have actually enjoyed the stream enough for some of them to stick around?
[2017-05-08 01:06:28 UTC] soulrider95: ^ @ boxman
[2017-05-08 01:06:29 UTC] boxman222: that is how it usually ends up
[2017-05-08 01:06:38 UTC] soulrider95: That's how I found most of the people I follow
[2017-05-08 01:06:49 UTC] bethebaby: "Hey man we're here to get you to talk to this streamer, who has fucking 20x the amount of viewers you have, and has experience in selling cars and finances who wants to talk you about your car shopping. He's got some tips that'll save you big."
[2017-05-08 01:06:52 UTC] batzera: @boxman222 so true, I'm found a ton of cool streamers from raids and hosting
[2017-05-08 01:06:53 UTC] boxman222: and even if 0 stayed around, then he would still end up with a much higher ranked stream which would have led to more people findiing his stream
[2017-05-08 01:07:00 UTC] bethebaby: "Nah fuck that they're just a bunch of dang dirty trolls."
[2017-05-08 01:07:04 UTC] boxman222: which again means more potential viewers that might become loyal viewers
[2017-05-08 01:07:08 UTC] boxman222: and even future subs
[2017-05-08 01:07:09 UTC] podusmonens: troooollls!
[2017-05-08 01:07:25 UTC] damnjp: I would say, those "haters" are okay guys, (like SoK, or Tevin), they just say things, thry don't go as far as swating or some shit like that, Phil should just be like "thanks for advertising" 'cause that's​ pretty much it
[2017-05-08 01:07:31 UTC] yacherdy: fleet faxes
[2017-05-08 01:07:32 UTC] yacherdy: idk
[2017-05-08 01:08:17 UTC] yacherdy: well guys it's been fun
[2017-05-08 01:08:23 UTC] yacherdy: but it's time to get pizza
[2017-05-08 01:08:26 UTC] yacherdy: and balls
[2017-05-08 01:08:27 UTC] damnjp: sometimes you guys sound like scared of these "haters" idk...
[2017-05-08 01:08:53 UTC] yacherdy: salutations all walks of life, I appreciate your company...
[2017-05-08 01:09:04 UTC] bethebaby: @DamnJP I said the same thing hours ago; people in this chat are deathly afraid of "trolls", "haters", and "detractors."
[2017-05-08 01:09:04 UTC] deep_drive: These haters have done nothing but hurt Phil
[2017-05-08 01:09:07 UTC] yacherdy: have fun and be nice to each other
[2017-05-08 01:09:08 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bye YaCherdy enjoy your pizza
[2017-05-08 01:09:11 UTC] deep_drive: given him FALSE copyright strikes
[2017-05-08 01:09:15 UTC] deep_drive: doxxed him
[2017-05-08 01:09:15 UTC] yacherdy: thanks jimbob bi bi :)
[2017-05-08 01:09:19 UTC] deep_drive: swatted him
[2017-05-08 01:09:29 UTC] deep_drive: and you guys think they're fine
[2017-05-08 01:09:29 UTC] soulrider95: I don't recall doing any of that WutFace
[2017-05-08 01:09:52 UTC] boxman222: Deep_Drive: great way to generalize... and for your information some of his rabid fanboys have done all of these things
[2017-05-08 01:09:59 UTC] boxman222: the majority is against doxxing
[2017-05-08 01:10:00 UTC] bethebaby: "Swatting" yeah, two fucking uniforms poking his laptop and saying "that's a lot of gamer shit" is totally swatting.
[2017-05-08 01:10:04 UTC] deep_drive: stop denying it soulrider95 you probably bandwagoned with the rest of your haters to do all that
[2017-05-08 01:10:10 UTC] deep_drive: Fuck you all....I'm leaving
[2017-05-08 01:10:13 UTC] soulrider95: way to generalize LUL
[2017-05-08 01:10:25 UTC] boxman222: large percentage of the so called haters even used to longtime viewers or subs of his
[2017-05-08 01:10:32 UTC] knyghty: ok good maybe we can have a constructive conversation now
[2017-05-08 01:10:35 UTC] damnjp: wow that was Deep... Kappa
[2017-05-08 01:10:37 UTC] batzera: LOL right
[2017-05-08 01:10:39 UTC] boxman222: there are good and bad "haters"
[2017-05-08 01:10:51 UTC] georgetdawson: Why are people that are subbed hatin?
[2017-05-08 01:10:53 UTC] boxman222: and they all have different reasons for being in that group
[2017-05-08 01:11:05 UTC] soulrider95: I'm gonna go get my meal prep for this week done and walk my dog , cya
[2017-05-08 01:11:06 UTC] boxman222: some just want him to change, others are there to just watch the trainwreck
[2017-05-08 01:11:12 UTC] bethebaby: @Deep_Drive Phil's got you totally fucking hooked. Bet you believed every last word he's ever said about those "mentally ill sociopaths".
[2017-05-08 01:11:20 UTC] boxman222: and a tiniy minority might actually wish him harm
[2017-05-08 01:11:36 UTC] georgetdawson: That's mental
[2017-05-08 01:11:38 UTC] podusmonens: welp, it's a dead subject. riperino :(
[2017-05-08 01:11:42 UTC] damnjp: now tell, why ppl on google aren't street smart?
[2017-05-08 01:11:56 UTC] damnjp: 'cause that thing that phil said was pretty...uuuhn...
[2017-05-08 01:11:59 UTC] damnjp: I dk
[2017-05-08 01:12:04 UTC] podusmonens: dunno they have the google street car right Kappa
[2017-05-08 01:12:06 UTC] damnjp: strange
[2017-05-08 01:12:21 UTC] podusmonens: to take footage for google maps
[2017-05-08 01:12:45 UTC] georgetdawson: It's quiet...
[2017-05-08 01:13:29 UTC] podusmonens: have a good day, folks
[2017-05-08 01:13:41 UTC] bethebaby: @podusmonens Have a nice trip.
[2017-05-08 01:15:02 UTC] damnjp: just gonna say this, phil gets these good opportunities at his hands and he fucks up every time with those, a shame, but hey, we can at least have hope that he gets ok right? with all his problems and all, anyway, going to bed, bye everyone
[2017-05-08 01:15:33 UTC] boxman222: cya
[2017-05-08 01:17:34 UTC] duderito2: I get what you're saying bethebaby not to paint everyone with the same brush. But some of the stuff is insane and people seem to think Phil is the sole villian of the story.I've seen a vid of Fred on YT threatening to dox someone, the situation with "marle" was insane pretending to be someone else for 12 months for the luls and Tevin while a chill dude I wonder is he all there to spend 7 hours going through Phil's xmas vids to analyse them. It's not all one sided man.
[2017-05-08 01:41:01 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Yeah I don't get it
