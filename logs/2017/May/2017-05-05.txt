[2017-05-05 01:35:28 UTC] darksydephil: i'm starting to get a pretty sizeable amount of daily follows now, very nice
[2017-05-05 01:45:24 UTC] soulrider95: DarksydePhil you gonna be playing Prey tonight? releases in a couple hours
[2017-05-05 01:46:33 UTC] mythstorm24: He's playing Prey tomorrow.
[2017-05-05 01:47:51 UTC] jwalker70: Currently grinding in Persona 5
[2017-05-05 01:48:15 UTC] jwalker70: and by grinding I mean I'm completing the entire strength link in 10 minutes
[2017-05-05 01:52:15 UTC] darksydephil: I'm playing Prey all day tomorrow, not tonight
[2017-05-05 01:52:28 UTC] damienelmaskador: I'm stopping my dungeon grinding to watch this, I mean, this could be the last one, hopefully :D
[2017-05-05 01:52:33 UTC] darksydephil: 2 streams, although the first one will be an hour shorter than usaul
[2017-05-05 01:53:26 UTC] mythstorm24: Hoping for a short pre stream so we can just jump right in.
[2017-05-05 01:53:40 UTC] mythstorm24: I need to see how this ends tonight.
[2017-05-05 01:53:57 UTC] jwalker70: Hey Phil what's your blood type?
[2017-05-05 01:54:09 UTC] jwalker70: :p
[2017-05-05 01:54:33 UTC] soulrider95: aww not tonight, can't be here tomorrow.
[2017-05-05 01:54:41 UTC] mythstorm24: If the mastermind is Kyoko somehow I will literally be like WTF.
[2017-05-05 01:54:46 UTC] soulrider95: Not for the first stream at all
[2017-05-05 01:55:11 UTC] jwalker70: I have a theory of who it is
[2017-05-05 01:55:37 UTC] deep_drive: From Phils theory at the end of last nights stream it looks like its probably one of the original 10 who "died"
[2017-05-05 01:55:41 UTC] mythstorm24: Honestly it only makes sense like you said last night that it's one of the "dead" students because how the hell could they be controlling Monokuma.
[2017-05-05 01:56:34 UTC] mythstorm24: Although in the back of my mind I feel it could be Byakuya because he's too rich for his own good and would theoretically have the capital to pull it off.
[2017-05-05 01:56:41 UTC] deep_drive: I honestly didn't even think about seeing the number of people in the morgue like Phil did
[2017-05-05 01:57:01 UTC] jwalker70: Did Phil hit the nail with the plothole about Mondo's death?
[2017-05-05 01:57:19 UTC] mythstorm24: About how the tires were rubber??
[2017-05-05 01:57:26 UTC] mythstorm24: Maybe.
[2017-05-05 01:57:38 UTC] jwalker70: My mind will be blown
[2017-05-05 01:57:40 UTC] deep_drive: He might have talked about it during mondos trial but he didn't talk about it last night
[2017-05-05 01:57:47 UTC] mythstorm24: It was the stupidest execution.
[2017-05-05 01:58:05 UTC] deep_drive: oh was that the bike spinning in circles death?
[2017-05-05 01:58:11 UTC] mythstorm24: Yeah.
[2017-05-05 01:58:14 UTC] damienelmaskador: Death by centrifuge?
[2017-05-05 01:58:17 UTC] darksydephil: ok setting up in a sec
[2017-05-05 01:58:26 UTC] deep_drive: yeah he called bullshit on that right when he saw it mythstorm
[2017-05-05 01:58:29 UTC] mythstorm24: I am super curious what happens if you pick to reveal Kyoko's lie.
[2017-05-05 01:58:32 UTC] sanguinenite: I am glad I missed the Nioh DLC because I hated that game
[2017-05-05 01:58:37 UTC] mythstorm24: Or maybe the game is like
[2017-05-05 01:58:45 UTC] sanguinenite: @MythStorm24 It already happened
[2017-05-05 01:58:47 UTC] mythstorm24: LOL No choice for you.
[2017-05-05 01:59:05 UTC] sanguinenite: No choice?
[2017-05-05 01:59:06 UTC] jwalker70: My theory is that monokuma was controlled by the 16th student but then got switched when she died
[2017-05-05 01:59:12 UTC] damienelmaskador: We need to inspect the bodies at the morgue to check Mondo's bullshit
[2017-05-05 01:59:13 UTC] mythstorm24: No Phil kept it hidden I want to see what happens if it's revealed.
[2017-05-05 01:59:13 UTC] deep_drive: I heard kyoko dies mythstorm but then it immediatley jumps back to the decision you made, so its like an alternate ending
[2017-05-05 01:59:16 UTC] deep_drive: but not a true ending
[2017-05-05 01:59:23 UTC] jwalker70: because monikuma was off for the whole morning
[2017-05-05 02:00:01 UTC] deep_drive: so you get as much choice as you did to reveal or hide the truth to kyoko
[2017-05-05 02:00:02 UTC] deep_drive: LOL
[2017-05-05 02:00:06 UTC] mythstorm24: @jwalker70 That's my thinking but then why would Monokuma still be a thing.
[2017-05-05 02:00:23 UTC] deep_drive: whats the point of having a choice when the main character says i dont want to do this when you click one of them
[2017-05-05 02:00:29 UTC] mythstorm24: Unless multiple students are in on it.
[2017-05-05 02:00:50 UTC] mythstorm24: Didn't they say there was more than one Ultimate Despair?
[2017-05-05 02:00:55 UTC] darksydephil: I think that Mukuro or whoever was working in cahoots with someone else, as they explained last night: ultimate despair isn't just one person. so it was the both of them controlling monokuma up to a point, but now that Mukuro is dead (we think) it's probably the other remaining person. but i dunno who the hell that is
[2017-05-05 02:01:09 UTC] sanguinenite: ^
[2017-05-05 02:01:18 UTC] deep_drive: ahhh that makes sense phil
[2017-05-05 02:01:27 UTC] akioartorius: Find out next time on the next episode of Dangan Ronpa
[2017-05-05 02:01:29 UTC] mythstorm24: Yeah that's probably the most likely scenario.
[2017-05-05 02:01:32 UTC] deep_drive: just like in kyokos journal that there are two ultimate despairs
[2017-05-05 02:02:03 UTC] mto2089: monokuma is the same person who wields the almighty 4 dark devas of destruction
[2017-05-05 02:02:11 UTC] mythstorm24: Phil better finish this tonight...
[2017-05-05 02:02:19 UTC] deep_drive: the only question is who?
[2017-05-05 02:02:41 UTC] akioartorius: @Mto2089 its too soon for that reference
[2017-05-05 02:02:46 UTC] deep_drive: it better not be junko who died in the very beginning
[2017-05-05 02:03:16 UTC] jwalker70: One of the questions I have is who was controlling monokuma from the beginning? It had to be Mukuro right?
[2017-05-05 02:03:24 UTC] damienelmaskador: In any case, we need to check to bodies,
[2017-05-05 02:03:28 UTC] jwalker70: If she died then someone else took control
[2017-05-05 02:03:32 UTC] akioartorius: Phil prob could finish this tonight
[2017-05-05 02:03:38 UTC] blue_blur64: so who else is watching the persona stream from today? Kappa
[2017-05-05 02:03:42 UTC] deep_drive: yeah thats the theory jwalker70
[2017-05-05 02:03:53 UTC] mythstorm24: Oh yeah Phil if you still have Black Ops 3 would you consider playing the new Zombies DLC??
[2017-05-05 02:04:02 UTC] jwalker70: or she made it look like she died using someone we thought was dead
[2017-05-05 02:04:13 UTC] blue_blur64: Myth, that is really random lol
[2017-05-05 02:04:17 UTC] deep_drive: :D hi silentwarrior
[2017-05-05 02:04:20 UTC] mythstorm24: That shit is going to get so many views.
[2017-05-05 02:04:33 UTC] jwalker70: But who else would have the tatoo
[2017-05-05 02:04:46 UTC] deep_drive: except it would be seen as advertiser unfriendly MythStorm24 Kappa
[2017-05-05 02:05:01 UTC] mythstorm24: Yeah but I'm super pumped for it so I want to A) Make Phil aware and B) see if he has any interest in playing it.
[2017-05-05 02:05:16 UTC] jwalker70: Either way I hope we end it with a bullet time battle with monokuma
[2017-05-05 02:05:20 UTC] mythstorm24: .... That was B ) God damn it
[2017-05-05 02:05:20 UTC] darksydephil: i've got something new on teespring to show you guys on stream tonight!
[2017-05-05 02:05:28 UTC] deep_drive: thats cool :D
[2017-05-05 02:05:39 UTC] mto2089: Enoshima got shot by a bunch of spears guys....
[2017-05-05 02:05:45 UTC] mto2089: back in chapter 1
[2017-05-05 02:05:53 UTC] jwalker70: Speaking of which how would you like posters on teespring?
[2017-05-05 02:06:12 UTC] mythstorm24: The literal biggest Twist of them all would be if it's Junko.
[2017-05-05 02:06:19 UTC] mythstorm24: I mean she was the first to die.
[2017-05-05 02:06:45 UTC] megamannt125: Sayaka was the first to die.
[2017-05-05 02:06:48 UTC] kingwhiterabbit: When's stream start?
[2017-05-05 02:06:52 UTC] jwalker70: How could she survive that the spikes?
[2017-05-05 02:06:59 UTC] mythstorm24: Junko died before that @Megamannt125
[2017-05-05 02:07:03 UTC] megamannt125: No she didn't.
[2017-05-05 02:07:03 UTC] sanguinenite: Stream starting?
[2017-05-05 02:07:12 UTC] jwalker70: actually she didn't
[2017-05-05 02:07:12 UTC] megamannt125: Junko died after Monokuma explained the first trial
[2017-05-05 02:07:19 UTC] mythstorm24: Oh right....
[2017-05-05 02:07:34 UTC] disagreeablers: :O
[2017-05-05 02:07:38 UTC] rinmathews: Sayaka died first. Then Junko died because she didn't want to participate in the trial
[2017-05-05 02:07:38 UTC] damienelmaskador: yeah Sayaka died first then Junk said I'd have none of that bullshit and then bam
[2017-05-05 02:07:40 UTC] mythstorm24: Well still it's close enough but the only one to not be murdered by a student
[2017-05-05 02:07:45 UTC] kingwhiterabbit: cheer100 Danganronpa HYPE!
[2017-05-05 02:08:01 UTC] jwalker70: Wait a minute! Didn't she say right before she died "This wasn't supposed to happen"!?
[2017-05-05 02:08:09 UTC] deep_drive: nice cheer kingwhiterabbit
[2017-05-05 02:08:10 UTC] mythstorm24: Assuming some kind of Twist where someone isn't dead it would only make sense for it to be someone who was executed.
[2017-05-05 02:08:18 UTC] mythstorm24: Not killed by a student.
[2017-05-05 02:08:31 UTC] kingwhiterabbit: I love this game I love watching Phil play it
[2017-05-05 02:08:57 UTC] mythstorm24: If Phil does not play the sequel I will write an angry complaint.
[2017-05-05 02:09:00 UTC] megamannt125: I think if someone were actually not dead it would have to be someone with an ambiguous death, wouldn't it? Junko and Sayaka for instance were pretty straight forward
[2017-05-05 02:09:06 UTC] deep_drive: lol MythStorm24
[2017-05-05 02:09:09 UTC] darksydephil: thanks kingwhiterabbit !
[2017-05-05 02:09:11 UTC] darksydephil: ok stream starting now
[2017-05-05 02:09:19 UTC] darksydephil: sorry i was getting this new merch tile set up
[2017-05-05 02:09:19 UTC] popsicolo: Video games TriHard
[2017-05-05 02:09:28 UTC] popsicolo: Where's my gold badge? WutFace
[2017-05-05 02:09:33 UTC] mythstorm24: Lit merch incoming
[2017-05-05 02:09:35 UTC] megamannt125: I mean obviously I already know what happens but still fun to join in the speculation :P
[2017-05-05 02:09:39 UTC] rinmathews: Hopefully the patreons vote for Danganronpa 2 during the summer
[2017-05-05 02:09:42 UTC] mythstorm24: I know you got shafted @Popsicolo
[2017-05-05 02:09:45 UTC] kingwhiterabbit: no problem Phil, love your streams
[2017-05-05 02:09:47 UTC] damienelmaskador: Makes sense... since they keep repeating that there were only 16 people and every one is a student, that means the mastermind changed places with Mukuro before the game began, no?
[2017-05-05 02:10:10 UTC] disagreeablers: ...
[2017-05-05 02:10:31 UTC] friedjuanton: First!
[2017-05-05 02:10:36 UTC] megamannt125: OR the body isn't actually Mukuro's and the tattoo is fake
[2017-05-05 02:10:38 UTC] coralguy: Second
[2017-05-05 02:10:48 UTC] mto2089: well yasuhiro is the ultimate clairvoyance and he has yet to show that ability....why cant he pull a jigsaw from Saw 1?
[2017-05-05 02:10:58 UTC] megamannt125: He has shown that ability
[2017-05-05 02:11:03 UTC] deep_drive: lol they repeat that like every dialogue scene Damienelmaskador
[2017-05-05 02:11:06 UTC] megamannt125: If you pursue Kyoko's lie his prediction becomes true
[2017-05-05 02:11:14 UTC] mythstorm24: Are you saying it could be a body that was already dead? @Megamannt125
[2017-05-05 02:11:17 UTC] damienelmaskador: Probably cause its important Deep! lol
[2017-05-05 02:11:47 UTC] darksydephil: there were sixteen students.....AND ONE JANITOR! DUN DUN DUUUUUN
[2017-05-05 02:11:48 UTC] deep_drive: and then in the end: "Oh it was just a lie"
[2017-05-05 02:11:53 UTC] deep_drive: ahahahahaha phil
[2017-05-05 02:12:06 UTC] mythstorm24: Lol
[2017-05-05 02:12:07 UTC] sanguinenite: lol every highschool life needs a janitor right?
[2017-05-05 02:12:14 UTC] jwalker70: So do we think the mastermind is someone we think is dead or one of the remaining 6?
[2017-05-05 02:12:18 UTC] mythstorm24: what about THE MOUTH DOWN SOUTH?
[2017-05-05 02:12:24 UTC] damienelmaskador: I mean the mastermind cant control Monokum and pretend to be a student so the only logical explanation was taht Mukuro was acting :P
[2017-05-05 02:12:25 UTC] megamannt125: However, something else to note about the lights: Mondo was turned into butter, so they may be a red herring
[2017-05-05 02:12:27 UTC] popsicolo: This takes me back to when I was a High Schooler.
[2017-05-05 02:12:30 UTC] mto2089: screw it i blame nagito just cause
[2017-05-05 02:12:34 UTC] damienelmaskador: at the same time*
[2017-05-05 02:12:36 UTC] jwalker70: I prefer donkey punch
[2017-05-05 02:12:40 UTC] deep_drive: phil thinks its one who we think is dead and his theory makes the most sense
[2017-05-05 02:12:42 UTC] popsicolo: Donkey punch WutFace
[2017-05-05 02:12:44 UTC] akioartorius: is the stream starting?
[2017-05-05 02:12:47 UTC] tourwithme: how long ago was that popsicolo
[2017-05-05 02:12:49 UTC] deep_drive: soon akio
[2017-05-05 02:12:54 UTC] deep_drive: hes setting up
[2017-05-05 02:12:56 UTC] mythstorm24: Put it in follower only mode BTW
[2017-05-05 02:12:59 UTC] akioartorius: oh ok
[2017-05-05 02:13:02 UTC] popsicolo: I graduated in 2013.
[2017-05-05 02:13:06 UTC] megamannt125: I mean, we watched Monokuma put Mondo on his pancakes and eat them, so why would he have a place in the morgue?
[2017-05-05 02:13:08 UTC] mythstorm24: Before it gets crazy
[2017-05-05 02:13:11 UTC] rockman303: Yo whats up Everybody XD
[2017-05-05 02:13:17 UTC] deep_drive: from grade school pops? Kappa
[2017-05-05 02:13:19 UTC] tourwithme: ah, 2015
[2017-05-05 02:13:30 UTC] kingwhiterabbit: @Megamannt125 That's a good question.
[2017-05-05 02:13:36 UTC] popsicolo: Well, grades 9 through 12. KappaHD
[2017-05-05 02:13:37 UTC] mythstorm24: I hadn't thought about that @Megamannt125
[2017-05-05 02:13:46 UTC] mto2089: as long as it isnt someone who is schizo which is so clique i am happy with whoever is revealed
[2017-05-05 02:13:55 UTC] dspfandood: i hope phil goes late and just finshes the game
[2017-05-05 02:14:05 UTC] akioartorius: unless it is just the empty butter container kappa
[2017-05-05 02:14:10 UTC] kingwhiterabbit: Do you guys think Prey will suck?
[2017-05-05 02:14:13 UTC] jwalker70: perhaps monokuma (and the game) is trying to trick us by hammering in our head that it's one of the 16 students to make us think its one of us
[2017-05-05 02:14:20 UTC] rinmathews: Can't believe it's not Mondo Kappa
[2017-05-05 02:14:22 UTC] kingwhiterabbit: I haven't been able to see any reviews yet.
[2017-05-05 02:14:28 UTC] jwalker70: in which case Phil's theory makes even more sense
[2017-05-05 02:14:28 UTC] deep_drive: dspHmm I wonder how much Phil has left
[2017-05-05 02:14:35 UTC] tourwithme: when did phil graduate high school 2000 right?
[2017-05-05 02:14:36 UTC] popsicolo: My friends and I used to go to the local department store after school and climb into the televisions.
[2017-05-05 02:14:40 UTC] megamannt125: Not much left
[2017-05-05 02:14:54 UTC] megamannt125: I forgot how long the kyoko section was before the investigation, but at this point he only has about 3 hours
[2017-05-05 02:14:56 UTC] mythstorm24: Yo can someone put the chat in follower only mode now???
[2017-05-05 02:15:01 UTC] jwalker70: Monouma's doing some Shaun Murry level lying
[2017-05-05 02:15:13 UTC] mythstorm24: I do not want assholes spoiling it on the pre stream.
[2017-05-05 02:15:15 UTC] jwalker70: "I'm not saying no"
[2017-05-05 02:15:17 UTC] mythstorm24: Thank you
[2017-05-05 02:15:20 UTC] popsicolo: Yosh
[2017-05-05 02:15:22 UTC] akioartorius: the documents in the headmaster's office disagree
[2017-05-05 02:15:34 UTC] blueredblazer: The other awkward thing about the body, is that the Monokuma file says that it has injuries that are several days old; however in the 2nd page of Mukuro's file it says she was so skilled she never got hurt. So who was the body with many injuries?
[2017-05-05 02:15:50 UTC] mythstorm24: Ohhh you're right?
[2017-05-05 02:15:58 UTC] drowsylouis: wow dude he was offscreen !
[2017-05-05 02:16:04 UTC] darksydephil: yeah maybe its not her lol
[2017-05-05 02:16:07 UTC] mythstorm24: Maybe it is a Tattoo red herring.
[2017-05-05 02:16:26 UTC] lvlpower: teespring t-shirt xD
[2017-05-05 02:16:27 UTC] jwalker70: Or another persona in the group?
[2017-05-05 02:16:28 UTC] gosoxtim: phill you see all will be reveal soo n ev il laugh
[2017-05-05 02:16:31 UTC] megamannt125: Sakura had a bunch of scars on her but.... that body definitely wasn't her
[2017-05-05 02:16:33 UTC] dspfandood: can you even save between trials?
[2017-05-05 02:16:34 UTC] rocthaice24: Damn he hasn't started talking yet going to be 30 mins before game starts lol
[2017-05-05 02:16:34 UTC] mythstorm24: Or wait did Monokuma confirm who it was at the trial?
[2017-05-05 02:16:36 UTC] dspfandood: seems sketchy as hell
[2017-05-05 02:16:43 UTC] mythstorm24: Then again it was all setup soooo.
[2017-05-05 02:16:48 UTC] deep_drive: she just had a change of heart Kappa
[2017-05-05 02:17:03 UTC] lvlpower: master of stealth lol
[2017-05-05 02:17:04 UTC] megamannt125: Maybe Yasuhiro was right all along and Kyoko is a ghost
[2017-05-05 02:17:06 UTC] jwalker70: im heading to the store brb
[2017-05-05 02:17:07 UTC] gosoxtim: i know phill so i ownt tell you i realmin silent
[2017-05-05 02:17:18 UTC] raikumo93: Hey Phil, how's the A/C been doing?
[2017-05-05 02:17:55 UTC] amariswolfgaming: A/C Stream Kreygasm
[2017-05-05 02:18:13 UTC] lvlpower: A/C

[2017-05-05 04:38:23 UTC] mythstorm24: The stream is over I can spam caps if I want
[2017-05-05 04:38:27 UTC] deep_drive: Go home nightbot, you're drunk
[2017-05-05 04:38:33 UTC] zahvone: Well, I won't be able to catch the stream next time so
[2017-05-05 04:38:35 UTC] zahvone: Feelsbad

[2017-05-05 04:41:17 UTC] zahvone: @deadshot130 Best option would be to tweet @DarksydePhil and ask him
[2017-05-05 04:42:53 UTC] crunch2k: Yo dawg you suck

[2017-05-05 17:23:38 UTC] mattty3888: anyonr here?
[2017-05-05 17:24:05 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hello hello
[2017-05-05 17:24:34 UTC] mattty3888: wasnt sure if chat worked offline
[2017-05-05 17:25:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I think there is setting to close the chat once the stream ends and reopen it again but this chat is always live
[2017-05-05 17:39:27 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey guys!
[2017-05-05 17:39:49 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey derich
[2017-05-05 17:40:15 UTC] derichloveslemur: @theycallmejimbob How you doing bud? I'm enjoying my day off of school
[2017-05-05 17:40:57 UTC] betheallen: HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA
[2017-05-05 17:41:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: good thanks derich
[2017-05-05 17:41:02 UTC] sanguinenite: lol
[2017-05-05 17:41:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey bethe
[2017-05-05 17:41:47 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you're the Teddy Long of the stream chat bethe?
[2017-05-05 17:41:48 UTC] derichloveslemur: @BeTheAllen @sanguinenite hello!
[2017-05-05 17:41:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey sanguinenite
[2017-05-05 17:42:03 UTC] sanguinenite: @Derichloveslemur What's up!
[2017-05-05 17:42:09 UTC] sanguinenite: @theycallmejimbob Hey dude!
[2017-05-05 17:42:21 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Prey hype SwiftRage
[2017-05-05 17:42:32 UTC] sanguinenite: Let us all now pray that Prey is good
[2017-05-05 17:42:44 UTC] sanguinenite: because I dont know anything about this game
[2017-05-05 17:42:59 UTC] derichloveslemur: @sanguinenite @theycallmejimbob Ready for Prey?
[2017-05-05 17:43:11 UTC] sanguinenite: More or less
[2017-05-05 17:43:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Neither do I, hopefully it's good.
[2017-05-05 17:43:39 UTC] sanguinenite: If it is bad, I hope Phil would just finish danganronpa
[2017-05-05 17:43:39 UTC] derichloveslemur: more definitely
[2017-05-05 17:44:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: since his vids are getting monetized again will he go back to playing danganronpa offline?
[2017-05-05 17:44:35 UTC] derichloveslemur: @theycallmejimbob I say he probably will.
[2017-05-05 17:44:35 UTC] sanguinenite: Doesnt make much sense since streaming Danganronpa would actually net him more money than NOT streaming it
[2017-05-05 17:44:50 UTC] sanguinenite: at least possibly thru tips
[2017-05-05 17:44:53 UTC] sanguinenite: and cheers
[2017-05-05 17:45:22 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I suppose it would be good for a 2nd stream since he said he has around 2 hours left
[2017-05-05 17:46:11 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Anyone buy the humble monthly bundle this month some great unlocks SeemsGood ?
[2017-05-05 17:46:26 UTC] sanguinenite: I think streaming narrative games is worth it since they are mostly patreon voted games and they are long, so it would make logical sense for phil to open stream. If ppl that dont want to be spoiled, they can just close chat
[2017-05-05 17:46:32 UTC] derichloveslemur: @theycallmejimbob @sanguinenite Hyped for Injustice 11 days?
[2017-05-05 17:47:11 UTC] derichloveslemur: Injustice 2*
[2017-05-05 17:47:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I am indeed derich should be fuuuun :D
[2017-05-05 17:47:34 UTC] derichloveslemur: @theycallmejimbob favorite character in injustice?
[2017-05-05 17:47:44 UTC] sanguinenite: @Derichloveslemur not really since I am not much a fan of fighting games
[2017-05-05 17:47:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Blue beetle Derichloveslemur :D
[2017-05-05 17:48:21 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I'm more looking forward to seeing Phil play it tbh I think he really liked the beta when he played it
[2017-05-05 17:48:21 UTC] derichloveslemur: @theycallmejimbob I love Supergirl
[2017-05-05 17:48:42 UTC] derichloveslemur: I remember: we want short shorts
[2017-05-05 17:49:46 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I agree with you there sanguinenite I suppose with all the games that were coming up it suited him to play an hour or so here and there offline
[2017-05-05 17:50:09 UTC] derichloveslemur: @theycallmejimbob Supergirls the best right?
[2017-05-05 17:50:22 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I guess derich :D
[2017-05-05 17:53:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: is Prey and Injustice 2 the only big releases this month
[2017-05-05 17:53:52 UTC] derichloveslemur: yeah
[2017-05-05 17:54:54 UTC] marky117: there is the surge on may 16th but its from lords of the fallen guys dspEw
[2017-05-05 17:55:13 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I know Phil was interested at the time in Ultra Street Fighter II on the switch that's being released at the end of the month. But he said that the console is sold out where he is.
[2017-05-05 17:55:25 UTC] marky117: friday the 13th on may 26th
[2017-05-05 17:56:23 UTC] tyholmes12: Hello chat

[2017-05-05 17:57:26 UTC] xeranarth: I'm still mad this Prey happened. I actually liked the original Prey. Tommy was cool. Vagina doors were hilarious. Guns were really cool looking.
[2017-05-05 17:57:27 UTC] tyholmes12: Best Buy is constantly getting Switches online if Phil wants to play USF2
[2017-05-05 17:57:50 UTC] pcgamehunter: He can't afford to buy a switch atm
[2017-05-05 17:58:23 UTC] pcgamehunter: He also played Zelda so it would be useless Kappa
[2017-05-05 17:58:46 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Tyholmes12 @Marky117 hello!
[2017-05-05 17:58:52 UTC] pcgamehunter: hey derich

[2017-05-05 18:00:15 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I am so not looking forward to this game to be honest
[2017-05-05 18:00:22 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I loved the original Prey
[2017-05-05 18:00:33 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Seeing what they did with the reboot just turned me off from it
[2017-05-05 18:00:42 UTC] darksydephil: setting up now
[2017-05-05 18:00:42 UTC] pcgamehunter: I never heard of it, nor the original, so kind of interested tbh
[2017-05-05 18:00:49 UTC] theycallmejimbob: wow they already have announced the characters in the first dlc pack for Injustice 2 and the game isn't out yet :D
[2017-05-05 18:00:56 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015 You are awesome!
[2017-05-05 18:01:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The original was kind of a Doomish, The Darkness type action game
[2017-05-05 18:01:04 UTC] frank16789: hello datksydephil
[2017-05-05 18:01:10 UTC] phoenixrising2015: with one of the most insanely creepy openings ever
[2017-05-05 18:01:12 UTC] dinohans: i wonder which level of difficulty phil choose?
[2017-05-05 18:01:18 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Hey @Derichloveslemur
[2017-05-05 18:01:20 UTC] pcgamehunter: maybe it's one of those that sucks for fans, is ok for newcomers :P
[2017-05-05 18:01:25 UTC] phoenixrising2015: This one is more like System Shock
[2017-05-05 18:01:29 UTC] tyholmes12: Who'd they announce JimBob?
[2017-05-05 18:01:39 UTC] frank16789: prey hyep
[2017-05-05 18:01:41 UTC] pcgamehunter: Hmm interesting, well we'll see once it starts
[2017-05-05 18:02:10 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Sub-Zero, Red Hood from batman apparently and Starfire (a Tamaran princess) tyholmes12
[2017-05-05 18:02:11 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But yeah, the original by design was unloseable however due to the mechanics except for the opening and the ending
[2017-05-05 18:02:19 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Starfire?!
[2017-05-05 18:02:23 UTC] tyholmes12: Sweet
[2017-05-05 18:02:37 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Are you still in followers-only mode?
[2017-05-05 18:02:38 UTC] darksydephil: dr zombius made 2 custom animations for this playthrough!
[2017-05-05 18:02:39 UTC] tyholmes12: Was hoping Red Hood would get put in there
[2017-05-05 18:02:58 UTC] pcgamehunter: cool
[2017-05-05 18:03:14 UTC] xanthis42: Red Hood will be fun
[2017-05-05 18:03:15 UTC] derichloveslemur: man just 11 days TiL Injustice 2!
[2017-05-05 18:03:44 UTC] tyholmes12: Also Charlotte's nudes leaked Keepo
[2017-05-05 18:03:47 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But yeah in the original Prey, except for the ending, and the opening, if you died, you went automatically always to a dead realm where your spirit did a meta game for about 15 seconds shooting things with a bow and arrow to get health and magic back
[2017-05-05 18:04:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Its a lot like Bioshock does with the Vita chambers
[2017-05-05 18:04:07 UTC] pcgamehunter: LOL
[2017-05-05 18:04:11 UTC] derichloveslemur: SubZero is in injustice 2 @theycallmejimbob?
[2017-05-05 18:04:18 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But the game was great
[2017-05-05 18:04:21 UTC] phoenixrising2015: It even had Art Bell
[2017-05-05 18:04:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yup Derich as one of the dlc fighter packs
[2017-05-05 18:04:50 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like throughout the original you could find radios to stop and listen to, and you heard a ficitional version of his show playing with people calling in reporting the invasion
[2017-05-05 18:05:00 UTC] derichloveslemur: @theycallmejimbob and what were the other 2?
[2017-05-05 18:05:17 UTC] pcgamehunter: Are these the same devs, or any who were part of the org team ?
[2017-05-05 18:05:22 UTC] phoenixrising2015: New debs
[2017-05-05 18:05:24 UTC] phoenixrising2015: devs
[2017-05-05 18:05:39 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Red Hood and Starfire derich
[2017-05-05 18:05:41 UTC] phoenixrising2015: They did have a sequel planned where you were playing as a character from a crash you see early inthe game
[2017-05-05 18:05:43 UTC] darksydephil: setting up the new alerts now
[2017-05-05 18:05:50 UTC] phoenixrising2015: but it was stuck in development and cancelled
[2017-05-05 18:05:52 UTC] ellietsantiara: Hi everyone
[2017-05-05 18:05:56 UTC] pcgamehunter: Shame the old ones seem to have a VTM: bloodlines level humor :P
[2017-05-05 18:06:00 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Did you hear they announced sub-zero in injustice 2?
[2017-05-05 18:06:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey ellietsantiara
[2017-05-05 18:06:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and then the IP rebooted
[2017-05-05 18:06:21 UTC] jwalker70: i saw a 4k capture device for $200
[2017-05-05 18:06:26 UTC] ellietsantiara: Oh yeah i saw the trailer, they announced SubZero, Starfire and Redhood
[2017-05-05 18:06:45 UTC] phoenixrising2015: but yes, the original Prey's first ten minutes are still with me
[2017-05-05 18:06:53 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You are in a bar where your girlfriend works
[2017-05-05 18:06:59 UTC] xeranarth: RIP original Pery
[2017-05-05 18:07:04 UTC] phoenixrising2015: you are planning on leaving your indian reservation
[2017-05-05 18:07:13 UTC] darksydephil: sub zero lol

[2017-05-05 18:07:15 UTC] phoenixrising2015: your grandfather is all calm and mystical to you
[2017-05-05 18:07:21 UTC] ellietsantiara: and if you pay close attention in the backround, you can see the sillouettes of other character to be released
[2017-05-05 18:07:24 UTC] darksydephil: netherrealm doesn't learn. Ed Boon does what he wants
[2017-05-05 18:07:29 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and then you engage in a bar room brawl
[2017-05-05 18:07:31 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, Injustice 2 is gonna be good though
[2017-05-05 18:07:31 UTC] jwalker70: i played the demo of the first game. very much like half life
[2017-05-05 18:07:33 UTC] danielsvenson1: phil have u ever played the original prey?
[2017-05-05 18:07:49 UTC] derichloveslemur: will Solomon grundy be in Injustice 2 I wonder.
[2017-05-05 18:07:51 UTC] phoenixrising2015: suddenly, the TV goes crazy and they talk about reports of lights everywhere and alerts
[2017-05-05 18:07:54 UTC] phoenixrising2015: the TV goes out
[2017-05-05 18:07:57 UTC] phoenixrising2015: the power goes out
[2017-05-05 18:08:08 UTC] ufccurbstomp: What's wrong with sub-zero?
[2017-05-05 18:08:13 UTC] danielsvenson1: the original game was made by the people who made duke nukem and starred a native american
[2017-05-05 18:08:14 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The Jukebox goes crazy and starts playing Don't Fear The Reaper
[2017-05-05 18:08:16 UTC] jwalker70: never played past the demo
[2017-05-05 18:08:20 UTC] ellietsantiara: you can see Black Manta, Vixxen and possibly Clayface
[2017-05-05 18:08:42 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But yes, it shows an actual detailed invasion/abduction in the original Prey and it is so creepy
[2017-05-05 18:08:50 UTC] marky117: @Derichloveslemur hello
[2017-05-05 18:08:50 UTC] phoenixrising2015: They even made Don't Fear The Reaper scary
[2017-05-05 18:08:54 UTC] darksydephil: okay, stream will be going live in just a sec
[2017-05-05 18:09:01 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015 Solomon gruny in Injustice 2 would be awesome.

[2017-05-05 19:53:55 UTC] cinsolace92: so they can be humans too....theory already that the MC is subject zero
[2017-05-05 19:54:03 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, To Find Debrief the Safe Code You have to go in Morgan's Office If you press your face against the glass while the video is playing and look to the left, you'll see the code not erased just to let ya know.
[2017-05-05 19:54:06 UTC] betheallen: FALL FALL FALL
[2017-05-05 19:54:12 UTC] allntzz: thats cool if the mimics can be little objects like cups even
[2017-05-05 19:54:14 UTC] falconhoof1: Keep exploring Phil how u find shit in this game
[2017-05-05 19:54:19 UTC] shenmueps4: derich how do you know all of this
[2017-05-05 19:54:23 UTC] encelor: googlew
[2017-05-05 19:54:28 UTC] captcaveman4201: password still in your inventory
[2017-05-05 19:54:30 UTC] jaxunhero: @pcgamehunter NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis NotLikeThis I was banking on a long pre stream man
[2017-05-05 19:54:39 UTC] xanthis42: Why is he drifting?
[2017-05-05 19:54:42 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil that's how you find the safe code
[2017-05-05 19:54:47 UTC] deep_drive: good to know derich hasn't stopped his spoilers
[2017-05-05 19:54:56 UTC] pcgamehunter: @JaxunHero haha I know what you mean :D
[2017-05-05 19:54:57 UTC] iconicmaster1: Where are the Rita monsters SwiftRage
[2017-05-05 19:55:01 UTC] skumbie: stop trying to hold his hand let him explore the game himself
[2017-05-05 19:55:12 UTC] betheallen: deep really AND IM the spoiler
[2017-05-05 19:55:17 UTC] pcgamehunter: I'm getting Alien Isolation vibes, but would have been cooler if you couldn't kill the mimics
[2017-05-05 19:55:18 UTC] mejos007: @CaptCaveman4201 was't it the password to pc that he pick up ?
[2017-05-05 19:55:25 UTC] kcinpt_tv: I wonder if you can smash the glass floor? You should try it. Kappa
[2017-05-05 19:55:27 UTC] jaxunhero: @pcgamehunter reminds me of Alien
[2017-05-05 19:55:30 UTC] stuart360: Phoenix this game has nothing to do with the orig Prey. It was its own sci-fi game and Bethesda told Arkane they had to use the Prey name, but its not actually anything to do with Prey
[2017-05-05 19:55:31 UTC] deep_drive: lol bethe
[2017-05-05 19:55:44 UTC] pcgamehunter: That's awesome :D
[2017-05-05 19:55:51 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Mimic: Maybe it won't see where I changed....
[2017-05-05 19:55:52 UTC] conky89: can it do the can can?
[2017-05-05 19:55:52 UTC] kushiyakitori: the solution to spoilers is to flood with fake spoilers
[2017-05-05 19:55:58 UTC] shenmueps4: @stuart360 it sort of does. Its what wikipedia says
[2017-05-05 19:55:59 UTC] lunaequalsluna: i'm liking this a lot so far
[2017-05-05 19:56:05 UTC] shenmueps4: it is supposed to be a reboot
[2017-05-05 19:56:06 UTC] falconhoof1: This game is biblical
[2017-05-05 19:56:15 UTC] pcgamehunter: Morgana is the main villain of Prey Kreygasm !
[2017-05-05 19:56:17 UTC] shenmueps4: not just the name
[2017-05-05 19:56:17 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Seriously it turned right in front of you like "Maybe this human won't notice what I just did"
[2017-05-05 19:56:19 UTC] falconhoof1: Very old school
[2017-05-05 19:56:21 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Gotta get going sadly. Good luck on your Prey playthrough.
[2017-05-05 19:56:26 UTC] beyond25: wow mimics are so piss easy to beat on normal FailFish
[2017-05-05 19:56:28 UTC] encelor: funny thing is the enemies where there all along but you never knew
[2017-05-05 19:56:34 UTC] viewtifuljen: yabba my icing
[2017-05-05 19:56:44 UTC] pcgamehunter: Also Morgan's brother Alex is actually the principal of Shujin high school Kappa
[2017-05-05 19:56:45 UTC] stuart360: The devs even said it has nothing to do with the orig Prey, it was Bethesda who told them they had to use the Prey name. Its a bit like Super Mario Bros 2
[2017-05-05 19:56:59 UTC] lvlpower: @beyond25 probably get harder
[2017-05-05 19:57:01 UTC] tourwithme: nothing to miss if you leave, this is sooo boring
[2017-05-05 19:57:15 UTC] thedoctor5437: @Phoenixrising2015 maybe the mimic thinks since it works with other animals maybe it will work with humans. it probably doest know how complex we think
[2017-05-05 19:57:34 UTC] phoenixrising2015: That actually makes a lot of sense
[2017-05-05 19:57:43 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, I gotta get going but Good luck on your awesome Prey Playthrough
[2017-05-05 19:57:44 UTC] kcinpt_tv: Yeah the verticality is reminding me a lot of Dishonored.
[2017-05-05 19:57:50 UTC] stuart360: And never use Wikipedia as a reference, anyone can write info on that
[2017-05-05 19:57:52 UTC] pcgamehunter: That has to be some really fucking weird alien, if it can adapt into material or at least emulate it's look and texture perfectly
[2017-05-05 19:57:57 UTC] conky89: This might be a game that is better to play yourself rather than watch
[2017-05-05 19:58:04 UTC] dnbray: @Beyond25 you just wait till he encounters the phantoms they will destroy him
[2017-05-05 19:58:04 UTC] falconhoof1: Can't wait till he encounters the other enemies
[2017-05-05 19:58:10 UTC] royal_phalanx91: it eats people's faces apparently
[2017-05-05 19:58:10 UTC] pcgamehunter: Also how and why do they kill humans
[2017-05-05 19:58:11 UTC] falconhoof1: Yep ^
[2017-05-05 19:58:11 UTC] allntzz: WOW totally headcrab style ya
[2017-05-05 19:58:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: Oh ... ok
[2017-05-05 19:58:19 UTC] kcinpt_tv: What if... Phil is a mimic WutFace
[2017-05-05 19:58:30 UTC] encelor: @KCINpt_TV close
[2017-05-05 19:58:31 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Yu's underwear is a mimic Kappa
[2017-05-05 19:58:36 UTC] allntzz: reiped by heaadcrab Kappa
[2017-05-05 19:58:37 UTC] beyond25: Fun fact: if you play as female January is also female!
[2017-05-05 19:58:42 UTC] theheartless09: phil would be dead if he was a mimic
[2017-05-05 19:58:42 UTC] pcgamehunter: Does it like drain all the blood in like 2s ? WutFace
[2017-05-05 19:58:50 UTC] theheartless09: this isn't like the thing
[2017-05-05 19:58:51 UTC] kushiyakitori: @Beyond25 thats pretty interesting
[2017-05-05 19:58:52 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Later stay awesome :D Got a party tonight sadly.
[2017-05-05 19:58:56 UTC] tourwithme: looks like uroborus
[2017-05-05 19:59:12 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: that sounds like a spiler beyond
[2017-05-05 19:59:13 UTC] conky89: This is kind of like "The Thing" where the monster can turn into inanimate objects
[2017-05-05 19:59:16 UTC] dnbray: mimics are easy its the phantoms that are a problem
[2017-05-05 19:59:18 UTC] encelor: @DarksydePhil if you see 2 same objest give it a whack
[2017-05-05 19:59:24 UTC] beyond25: @KushiYakitori ikr
[2017-05-05 19:59:33 UTC] zahvone: Bro what the hell

[2017-05-05 20:02:52 UTC] pcgamehunter: I see this game will be easier on PC since you can turn the camera quickly :D
[2017-05-05 20:02:59 UTC] tourwithme: Im gonna leave guys any minute now im gonna go
[2017-05-05 20:03:09 UTC] bobbyhill187: lmao
[2017-05-05 20:03:10 UTC] katexo234: he needs a flamethrower

[2017-05-05 20:03:35 UTC] kushiyakitori: so the date is still feb, right?
[2017-05-05 20:03:37 UTC] allntzz: paranoia sets in
[2017-05-05 20:03:39 UTC] falconhoof1: Lol
[2017-05-05 20:03:44 UTC] derichloveslemur: @encelor I'll see ya soon bud take care of yourself.
[2017-05-05 20:03:50 UTC] encelor: you too derich
[2017-05-05 20:04:07 UTC] lvlpower: this game is like half life
[2017-05-05 20:04:12 UTC] conky89: If those were poppies maybe you could process them to make opium as a way to relax yourself from the horrors
[2017-05-05 20:04:26 UTC] encelor: are you guys saying that this is half life 3 Kappa
[2017-05-05 20:04:38 UTC] bobbyhill187: @encelor ayyyy Kappa InuyoFace
[2017-05-05 20:04:39 UTC] tourwithme: behind prey cover it says hl3
[2017-05-05 20:04:39 UTC] ellietsantiara: This game is actually interesting i dont know why everyone says it sucks.
[2017-05-05 20:04:45 UTC] ellietsantiara: it's better than outlas 2
[2017-05-05 20:04:49 UTC] bethebaby: People are saying it's like Half Life. Good thing I've never played it.
[2017-05-05 20:04:51 UTC] falconhoof1: It's more like system shock but there's some half life vibes there
[2017-05-05 20:04:52 UTC] doctorzzz: you can climb up somewhere
[2017-05-05 20:04:57 UTC] lannyto: jesus
[2017-05-05 20:04:59 UTC] pcgamehunter: This game beat outlast 2 in the first 2 seconds lol
[2017-05-05 20:05:06 UTC] scott_parker8: It's not a Japanese RPG so it sucks Kappa
[2017-05-05 20:05:18 UTC] conky89: Valve just said recently that a Half Life 3 is very unlikely to ever happen. The only real progress they have made on it is some concepts but that is about it...
[2017-05-05 20:05:36 UTC] allntzz: hope we have backup pants.....could get nasty ;P
[2017-05-05 20:05:37 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Their writers left Valve too
[2017-05-05 20:05:39 UTC] pcgamehunter: Outlast was fucking boring I watched an hour of the stream of Phil trying to find where to go and then fell asleep :/
[2017-05-05 20:05:41 UTC] katexo234: WutFace
[2017-05-05 20:05:42 UTC] falconhoof1: Time to get fucked up lol
[2017-05-05 20:05:42 UTC] bobbyhill187: aw cahhhhmaaaan BibleThump
[2017-05-05 20:05:43 UTC] encelor: shit is getting real Kappa 👌🏼
[2017-05-05 20:05:44 UTC] bethebaby: People should've given up hope by now. Valve doesn't do 3's.
[2017-05-05 20:05:47 UTC] conky89: No on there can ever motivate themselves to really work on it
[2017-05-05 20:05:56 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: did ti talk
[2017-05-05 20:05:57 UTC] bobbyhill187: im shaking in my yoshi booties

[2017-05-05 20:06:05 UTC] pcgamehunter: Also was that the main character from darkness 2 Kappa ?
[2017-05-05 20:06:05 UTC] xanthis42: Get your drinks ready
[2017-05-05 20:06:08 UTC] deep_drive: "Keep moving" Nah I'll sit down and read
[2017-05-05 20:06:14 UTC] dnbray: i save my ammo for the phantoms and use the wrench on mimics
[2017-05-05 20:06:23 UTC] xanthis42: It's about time for death #1
[2017-05-05 20:06:32 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Deep_Drive lol ye, he just stood there looking at the dangerous looking enemy :D
[2017-05-05 20:06:33 UTC] podusmonens: dis game is doody
[2017-05-05 20:06:33 UTC] encelor: @DarksydePhil harvest the plants
[2017-05-05 20:06:35 UTC] bethebaby: Half Life ended at 2, Portal ended at 2, and Team Fortress ended at 2. They. Don't. Do. 3's.
[2017-05-05 20:06:38 UTC] tourwithme: wrench=crowbar
[2017-05-05 20:07:04 UTC] scott_parker8: I'm looking forward to Steam 2 Kappa
[2017-05-05 20:07:04 UTC] tourwithme: dont forget Left 4 dead
[2017-05-05 20:07:23 UTC] naddodr: nice precise strikes
[2017-05-05 20:07:38 UTC] conky89: It does not seem like Valve is very interested in making single player games anymore. Especially with Steam, Counter Strike and DOTA printing money for the company
[2017-05-05 20:07:43 UTC] falconhoof1: Glue gun is biblical
[2017-05-05 20:07:46 UTC] encelor: @DarksydePhil you can make stairs with the glue cannon
[2017-05-05 20:07:47 UTC] allntzz: nice pose on dead guy
[2017-05-05 20:07:48 UTC] lannyto: why is everything a jumpscare sound
[2017-05-05 20:07:58 UTC] encelor: nvm game explianed
[2017-05-05 20:07:59 UTC] pcgamehunter: Again why is it called TranStar xD ?
[2017-05-05 20:08:13 UTC] bethebaby: @pcgamehunter All employees are trans?
[2017-05-05 20:08:17 UTC] conky89: Hey its a GLOO gun!
[2017-05-05 20:08:19 UTC] falconhoof1: Yea or stick the enemy but they can break out of it
[2017-05-05 20:08:29 UTC] doctorzzz: shoot gloo at the wall and climb it
[2017-05-05 20:08:32 UTC] falconhoof1: What is he doing lol
[2017-05-05 20:08:33 UTC] pcgamehunter: @bethebaby all the penises are actually mimics Kappa
[2017-05-05 20:08:35 UTC] encelor: @DarksydePhil shoot at the wall to make platforms
[2017-05-05 20:08:37 UTC] scott_parker8: Sounds like it's from Splatoon
[2017-05-05 20:08:40 UTC] allntzz: what is this magic
[2017-05-05 20:08:45 UTC] bethebaby: @pcgamehunter WutFace WutFace WutFace
[2017-05-05 20:08:50 UTC] doctorzzz: you can grab the gloo just shoot it at the wall
[2017-05-05 20:08:57 UTC] xanthis42: Why is he trying to travel in a teleporter?
[2017-05-05 20:08:57 UTC] allntzz: goo ballz?
[2017-05-05 20:09:01 UTC] chiggnwatch: is there autosave ?
[2017-05-05 20:09:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: There's quicksave
[2017-05-05 20:09:21 UTC] scott_parker8: It's splooge! Kreygasm
[2017-05-05 20:09:23 UTC] beyond25: I'm impressed SeemsGood
[2017-05-05 20:09:26 UTC] encelor: dspEw 👌🏼
[2017-05-05 20:09:28 UTC] naddodr: he was trying to balance on 1 little smudge lol
[2017-05-05 20:09:33 UTC] octanis: there is an autosave as well as quicksave
[2017-05-05 20:09:38 UTC] falconhoof1: That's why this game is great
[2017-05-05 20:09:41 UTC] doctorzzz: you can balancae on just one smudge
[2017-05-05 20:09:44 UTC] doctorzzz: its enough
[2017-05-05 20:09:46 UTC] falconhoof1: Lots of ways to go
[2017-05-05 20:09:52 UTC] naddodr: can you sniff it tho?
[2017-05-05 20:09:58 UTC] encelor: @DarksydePhil with spare parts you can repair
[2017-05-05 20:10:19 UTC] pcgamehunter: For aliens that can turn into anything, they sure love to make chirping sounds CoolStoryBob
[2017-05-05 20:10:23 UTC] bethebaby: InB4 autosaves end up screwing him and he has to redo gameplay. Guaranteed, in every game that only had autosaves he's always been fucked by the system at least once.
[2017-05-05 20:10:37 UTC] chachamaru89: No shit spare parts can repair lol
[2017-05-05 20:10:39 UTC] pcgamehunter: They're so giddy that they perfectly replicated the item, they can't help but chirp Kappa
[2017-05-05 20:10:58 UTC] xanthis42: How long till he notices he doesn't regenerate health?
[2017-05-05 20:11:03 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter or a taunt. so cocky that they'll let you know they are there and you can't find them
[2017-05-05 20:11:05 UTC] encelor: you slip on the banana peel Kappa
