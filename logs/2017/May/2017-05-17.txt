[2017-05-17 04:58:19 UTC] zahvone: I would like your opinion, though
[2017-05-17 04:58:34 UTC] zahvone: I like my overlay as an idea, but I'm unsure whether or not it's effective or disruptive.
[2017-05-17 04:58:47 UTC] yacherdy: it's pretty cool but then again I'm not the biggest fan of something that takes up a quarter of the screen
[2017-05-17 04:59:38 UTC] yacherdy: but really if the streams are gonna be super chill and not super serious then I don't see why not

[2017-05-17 05:02:42 UTC] podusmonens: Adviser and advisor are both accepted spellings of the noun meaning one who advises or counsels. There is no difference between them. But adviser, the older version, is listed as the primary spelling in most dictionaries, and it is about five times as common as advisor in current news publications from throughout the English-speaking world.

[2017-05-17 17:46:59 UTC] xxavenger74: I dont reallyunderstand the point of gear in this game, seems the only thing game modifying is the abilities you get but surely you can disallow use of them in Ranked play?

[2017-05-17 17:48:20 UTC] deadpylons: @XxAvenger74 for tournaments you have to turn them off and play on a equal playing field since some gear can be really overpowered
[2017-05-17 17:48:39 UTC] xxavenger74: So its just for skins and colors,seems the only thing that matters right?

Not only that but Darkseid can control his omega beam in mid attack making it really hard to dodge his attack and I think that his ultimate is the only one that can go full screne.
[2017-05-17 19:28:30 UTC] mygirlfriendsbulltyrone: @Riidi it's really bad, and there are set bonuses. basically no one will allow these even for a lot of casual matches but they also require insane farming (this mode)

I can't see him beating super-pro online players in this or any fighters these days tbh, even if he has a bit of a head start. his thoughts on some stuff w/ fighters isn't as entrenched as theirs

[2017-05-17 20:32:32 UTC] vince329: because there's a bunch of buffer for NRS games

[2017-05-17 20:32:34 UTC] euffy: Tutorial taught nothing, cool.
[2017-05-17 20:32:42 UTC] hapticbabyman: I never really quite "got" this input system for 2D fighters. Probably why I've always preferred something like SF or KOF/FF over MK and Injustice. This button system just seems more natural in a Virtua Fighter or Tekken but seems less intuitive for 2D fighters
[2017-05-17 20:32:45 UTC] 1buttondash: one thing this game lacks is character trials
[2017-05-17 20:32:49 UTC] vince329: and usually you gotta link different combos with each other
[2017-05-17 20:33:03 UTC] vince329: games like GG and SF just have normals that can link in with each other
[2017-05-17 20:33:04 UTC] drilbit777: @dukaduka Guilty Gears tutorial is really good tho
[2017-05-17 20:33:10 UTC] familiar_foe: Tutorial isn't to teach combo's its to teach some moves and tells you what some of his basic stuff is
[2017-05-17 20:33:14 UTC] thirdeyethethird: cheer100 well dude, hope your numbers rise imo you desrve it, ppl who steal your content to enjoy it with a different label are lying to themselves. somehow liking you is a hard pill to swallow. they're like apple fanboys, only care about the logo and not what's inside or the origin

[2017-05-17 20:33:22 UTC] drilbit777: Its suprisingly goes in really in depth with combos and learning how to anti air or punish
[2017-05-17 20:33:27 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil You can probably combo the breath.
[2017-05-17 20:33:28 UTC] dukaduka: @Drilbit777 thats what im saying :) injustice tutorial isnt as good

[2017-05-17 20:34:03 UTC] drilbit777: @dukaduka Yeah all it really is just teaching you how to do the moves which is something thats easy to do in training

[2017-05-17 20:34:13 UTC] drilbit777: At least a combo challenge mode would have been better lol

[2017-05-17 20:34:45 UTC] familiar_foe: @Drilbit777 Then you would have scrubs online doing one combo they learned

[2017-05-17 20:35:23 UTC] derichloveslemur: so not likely to combo.
[2017-05-17 20:35:32 UTC] drilbit777: @familiar_foe And? That justs giving you the basic idea of the game and its up to them to actually learn how to punish and anti air. Which is why guilty gears approach to its tutorial is much better
[2017-05-17 20:36:02 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Can you combo out of the teleport?
[2017-05-17 20:36:08 UTC] familiar_foe: @Drilbit777 It isn't giving you the basic idea of the game its just teaching you a combo...

[2017-05-17 20:37:15 UTC] epicnightshades: @darksydephil I think the headbutt counts as a crouch, so you can avoid some projectiles like that
[2017-05-17 20:37:23 UTC] derichloveslemur: Scarecrow is not really a combo character
[2017-05-17 20:37:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I don't have it Bobbi :( but if I did Blue Beetle would be my main

[2017-05-17 20:40:38 UTC] epicnightshades: @darksydephil Scarecrow relies on his trait to combo. His trait can be folloeed up with a wall bounce
