[2017-05-29 18:01:41 UTC] nomansskyvr: He could at least just check to see if he can connect on Friday the 13th
[2017-05-29 18:01:44 UTC] blue_blur64: And what's good is that the Persona stories aren't linked besides a few possible references
[2017-05-29 18:01:48 UTC] deep_drive: Perosna would be a fun stream

[2017-05-29 18:09:16 UTC] danielwarrenceo: Wow already giving excuses for being boring
[2017-05-29 18:09:22 UTC] nicohischier2: Hey @DarksydePhil Saw some of your WIP. Just so you know, whenever you choose to try Friday the 13th again, another PSN account would work as long as your main has PS+ (worst case scenario). Its a pretty painless process if you have a second email
[2017-05-29 18:09:28 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: friday the 13th plz
[2017-05-29 18:09:31 UTC] nomansskyvr: Try the Friday servers at least?
[2017-05-29 18:09:33 UTC] popsicolo: There are worse things that can be done with Nightbot, BeThe. Remember who used to be in charge of him?
[2017-05-29 18:09:39 UTC] betheallen: i wish deep
[2017-05-29 18:09:42 UTC] betheallen: i WISH
[2017-05-29 18:09:53 UTC] blue_blur64: Well I'm happy it's more persona. Are you gonna start the next palace or work on confidant ranks?
[2017-05-29 18:09:54 UTC] mto2089: you also would not be bombarded by randoms if you do another PSN account phil
[2017-05-29 18:10:02 UTC] dspfandood: psn plus is tied to the console phil make an alt account MiniK play f13th
[2017-05-29 18:10:04 UTC] deep_drive: they tweeted saying they fixed the login issue but I'm not counting on it
[2017-05-29 18:10:07 UTC] betheallen: pops welp
[2017-05-29 18:10:15 UTC] sofiarayne: They said Friday 13th should be live now

[2017-05-29 18:11:21 UTC] lvlpower: @nightbot MrDestructoid robots in disguise
[2017-05-29 18:11:29 UTC] darksydephil: right after the devs posted up "we've fixed the issues!" a ton of people responded with screenshots that indeed they did not and people still can't play
[2017-05-29 18:11:38 UTC] darksydephil: this is not surprising. the game is a train wreck of the highest magnitude
[2017-05-29 18:11:40 UTC] deep_drive: Apparently blue_blur64 is really excited for persona today anyways

[2017-05-29 18:12:15 UTC] phoenixrising2015: he suddenly started singing Party in the USA

[2017-05-29 18:22:59 UTC] guccikodak: ok cool
[2017-05-29 18:23:02 UTC] deep_drive: they can do what they want...reporting someone to the IRS doesn't do anything when phil has done everything right
[2017-05-29 18:23:06 UTC] darksydephil: there's nothing they're going to do that can have any effect
[2017-05-29 18:23:16 UTC] flyeaglesfly01: I think they have fixed the problem Phil was having with Friday the 13th

[2017-05-29 18:24:02 UTC] unoriginaldavid: What's Phil arguing about?
[2017-05-29 18:24:03 UTC] blue_blur64: Just let them run in circles trying to come up with another diabolical scheme Kappa

[2017-05-29 18:24:35 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: @DarksydePhil I think they said you were abusing tax write offs for your bizniss or something like that
[2017-05-29 18:24:44 UTC] dspfandood: thet say lots of things
[2017-05-29 18:24:46 UTC] phaaily: darksydephil eat on stream or riot
[2017-05-29 18:24:48 UTC] guccikodak: @DarksydePhil just wanted to let you know cause had alot of likes and comments... guy has been posting it every day on that channel
[2017-05-29 18:24:48 UTC] darksydephil: they're retarded lol

[2017-05-29 18:25:05 UTC] auzziesly47adam: only 4 people made the game ?
[2017-05-29 18:25:17 UTC] darksydephil: they have no evidence of anything, it doesn't even make sense. the IRS couldn't give a shit if dumbfuck kids spam them with baseless accusations
[2017-05-29 18:25:35 UTC] darksydephil: especially when my tax attorney is well respected and does everything right
[2017-05-29 18:25:36 UTC] daviddedavidson: well you did talk about what your deductions would be. Probably stirred up from that.
[2017-05-29 18:25:39 UTC] unoriginaldavid: Ohhh I think I understand what's going on
[2017-05-29 18:25:56 UTC] mrpapaveraceae: Watch, just for shits and giggles, since you're playing a different game, if you try to log in F13, it works perfectly.

[2017-05-29 18:26:20 UTC] darksydephil: no, i didnt talk about my deductions at any time recently. maybe years ago i've mentioned having the office is a write-off and the cost of anythign related to the business is. and that's it. very general info that is public knowledge
[2017-05-29 18:26:23 UTC] sofiarayne: If he tried it before he started this game it would stop me from wondering all day
[2017-05-29 18:26:30 UTC] mizorelover: Apparently they fixed most of the corrupted accounts in Friday the 13th.
[2017-05-29 18:26:35 UTC] flyeaglesfly01: @MrPapaveraceae Yeah. They have fixed the problem Phil was having but it shouldent have came out like that in the first place
[2017-05-29 18:26:50 UTC] deep_drive: Lol your one of the people who make detractor vids daviddedavidson...no need to stir up more drama
[2017-05-29 18:26:52 UTC] daviddedavidson: You commented how the piece of paper you used to read questions for Ask The King was a tax write-off.
[2017-05-29 18:26:56 UTC] mrpapaveraceae: Yeah.
[2017-05-29 18:27:01 UTC] daviddedavidson: im pretty sure thats what the big fuss was over
[2017-05-29 18:27:08 UTC] cherry_dood: lol. this is ridiculous
[2017-05-29 18:27:11 UTC] blue_blur64: A piece of paper? Dafuq

[2017-05-29 18:28:01 UTC] drzombius: Im good
[2017-05-29 18:28:01 UTC] blue_blur64: Even if it was true Phil, that'd be the most petty thing for people to use against you brownLUL
[2017-05-29 18:28:04 UTC] xxkillerstormxx: Idk why people care what Phil is paying i taxes?
[2017-05-29 18:28:06 UTC] blue_blur64: He isn't Papa

[2017-05-29 18:28:32 UTC] xthewrath93x: i want to watch F13
[2017-05-29 18:28:42 UTC] revivalhour: I don't even understand why you talk back to these people. It does nothing good for you. Every word you say to them is just something they can twist and put into a narrative they're making about you.
[2017-05-29 18:28:45 UTC] dspfandood: f13 has been dropped
[2017-05-29 18:28:49 UTC] unoriginaldavid: He said his account is corrupted so it wouldn't work regardless... I think
[2017-05-29 18:28:53 UTC] mrpapaveraceae: I think Phil already flushed F13 down the toilet.
[2017-05-29 18:28:55 UTC] darksydephil: if that bundle of paper was purchased exclusively to be stuff for the business, it actually would be a write-off. but in that case it wasn't
[2017-05-29 18:29:09 UTC] katexo234: F13 has been left in the dust
[2017-05-29 18:29:24 UTC] eplegutten: Maybe the game will work after a redownload
[2017-05-29 18:29:24 UTC] sofiarayne: But I want to see Phil kill Jason! There is a way
[2017-05-29 18:29:25 UTC] californiathunderqueer: Phil just bury all your money in your back yard. Problem solved.
[2017-05-29 18:29:25 UTC] drzombius: Today is 29th of May?
[2017-05-29 18:29:27 UTC] darksydephil: okay, everyone ready for prestream?

[2017-05-29 18:30:59 UTC] blue_blur64: *me
[2017-05-29 18:30:59 UTC] phoenixrising2015: They should have put in a custom ending if you kill Jason in the game since it takes a method to do so
[2017-05-29 18:31:03 UTC] sofiarayne: really? I heard it was difficult to kill him though xD
[2017-05-29 18:31:06 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no not david :(

[2017-05-29 18:31:45 UTC] vankimoon: Phill should enlist in the navy
[2017-05-29 18:32:01 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You have to hit him in the head enough to get his mask off(The machete does it in two hits I think) Tommy needs to come, and get the machete(Or axe I think) and someone has to get his moms sweater from his cabin but I think that instantly alerts him to where you are

[2017-05-29 18:32:45 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Then you have to have to wear the sweater and hold a weapon and let non masked jason see you, use the shirt as an item, and as he stops and starts to let his guard down run up and hit him while wearing the sweater, then let tommy use the machete

[2017-05-29 19:15:57 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter lol. Lucky for me I already heard that they do that and you need to kill them the same turn so I just did group attacks the whole time
[2017-05-29 19:15:59 UTC] betheallen: bobbi he asks too many questions though

[2017-05-29 19:17:16 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter they eventually stop but they are guaranteed to heal with diarahan at least one during the battle. lol. yeah fuck those abilities
[2017-05-29 19:17:31 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter I almost threw my controller when I saw they were doing perfect targeting of team weaknesses

[2017-05-29 19:18:18 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Look I'll admit it, I'm not the biggest persona fan, and I mostly skip this story. The only thing I dig is all the persona making and such. I actually am mildly autistic, and I legit just had enough of this dungeon and the boss broke me
[2017-05-29 19:18:24 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter huh? I didn't get hit by that. maybe you were on a higher mode than me. I was on normal

[2017-05-29 19:18:50 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter oh that must be it. that would piss me off so much. isn't that automatic loss at that point?
[2017-05-29 19:18:57 UTC] deep_drive: Just a troll derich
[2017-05-29 19:19:01 UTC] deep_drive: best to block him
[2017-05-29 19:19:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I just needed help with the game and just gave in
[2017-05-29 19:19:04 UTC] pcgamehunter: @KushiYakitori Yeah at one point they'd group together and use their combined attack to use this ability that basically is an unavoidable instakill, since even Futaba can't block it MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:19:12 UTC] wikipediabot: @DarksydePhil why don't you masturbate for us again? :)
[2017-05-29 19:19:17 UTC] derichloveslemur: @deep_drive yeah he insulted get blocked!
[2017-05-29 19:19:20 UTC] mrpapaveraceae: I imagine it has to do with low level enemies. Stronger ones might be harder to persuade.
[2017-05-29 19:19:20 UTC] sanguinenite: Poor Deep :/ dealing with their life problems is hard
[2017-05-29 19:19:30 UTC] deep_drive: lol bobbi
[2017-05-29 19:19:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: You can always hand over the reins to bethe Deep_Drive :P
[2017-05-29 19:19:43 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter damn that sucks. lol. oh wait, is that the move they use when it takes too many turns?
[2017-05-29 19:19:43 UTC] derichloveslemur: How was the Twitch N' Chill on Saturday sad I missed it.
[2017-05-29 19:19:43 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and yes, safe mode is broken.

[2017-05-29 19:20:17 UTC] vlayer: Confused
[2017-05-29 19:20:18 UTC] pcgamehunter: @KushiYakitori I think they said something to that effect, but first time it was in 17 turns, and when I beat them I was like in turn 58 or something MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:20:23 UTC] bobbi_ling: phil is still shaking from the day he nearly had to mod beth

[2017-05-29 19:20:31 UTC] pcgamehunter: So not really consistent
[2017-05-29 19:20:48 UTC] mrpapaveraceae: I like the Twitch and Chill, they're fun and I liked both days he did it, but the trolling in the games was getting a little boring.
[2017-05-29 19:20:52 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But I'll admit I have made in normal mode 100x the progress I made than in Persona 3 as this one I actually dug
[2017-05-29 19:21:00 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter thats really stupid that they dont have it consistent. lol. I'd take a break for days if I was downed at an early turn after using so much time
[2017-05-29 19:21:03 UTC] vince329: @fluttershy1970 you can fuse him, but he's not a boss
[2017-05-29 19:21:10 UTC] derichloveslemur: @darksydephil Futaba's mask lol it looks like a chameleon mask
[2017-05-29 19:21:11 UTC] akioartorius: I forget. Phil needs wind right?
[2017-05-29 19:21:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: @KushiYakitori I was just more enraged :D

[2017-05-29 19:22:15 UTC] pcgamehunter: @KushiYakitori Ironically after that I was beating the first stage of the final boss so fast, he had to cheat and get a turn in the middle of my turn to recover MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:22:16 UTC] bufubae: $5 tips for message no?

[2017-05-29 19:22:50 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter haha. the final boss does feel like a bit of a joke compared to fighting those two
[2017-05-29 19:22:50 UTC] deep_drive: it was a test akio

[2017-05-29 19:38:54 UTC] katexo234: *hugs deep it's gonna be ok*
[2017-05-29 19:38:54 UTC] pcgamehunter: Pretty sure it's just to distinguish her from the rest, she's purely Japanese as far as I know.
[2017-05-29 19:39:02 UTC] dspfandood: why dont you have any healing skills
[2017-05-29 19:39:03 UTC] dspfandood: lol

[2017-05-29 19:39:06 UTC] kushiyakitori: I hear a lot of people struggle with the puzzle at the end of the dungeon. Wonder how it'll play out for Phil

[2017-05-29 19:39:15 UTC] bobbi_ling: pc has a haru poster above his bed
[2017-05-29 19:39:16 UTC] blue_blur64: You really need either Morgana or Makoto for healing

[2017-05-29 19:39:19 UTC] randomron005: Morg for heal & wind.
[2017-05-29 19:39:29 UTC] blue_blur64: Ann is like a secondary healer imo
[2017-05-29 19:39:34 UTC] mizorelover: How many of those SP Adhesives did he buy?
[2017-05-29 19:39:35 UTC] bobbi_ling: ohnn
[2017-05-29 19:39:36 UTC] pcgamehunter: Haha Bobbi SeemsGood
[2017-05-29 19:39:36 UTC] nerozero88: @kushiyakitori the puzzle was nothin, it's the boss that's the pain in the ass
[2017-05-29 19:39:37 UTC] derichloveslemur: @darksydephil Doesn't Makoto have group healing or is Morgana?
[2017-05-29 19:39:44 UTC] aroman318: keep Makaoto she is useful for this dungeon
[2017-05-29 19:39:46 UTC] blue_blur64: I didn't think the boss was that bad Nero
[2017-05-29 19:39:47 UTC] akioartorius: both?
[2017-05-29 19:39:48 UTC] taurusoxford: Joker/Ryuji/Makoto/Haru - best team, period.
[2017-05-29 19:39:51 UTC] pcgamehunter: Hey if I got a free Haru poster I'd put that up, my wall are all white and boring tho :P
[2017-05-29 19:40:16 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, question Who has the group healing?
[2017-05-29 19:40:17 UTC] kushiyakitori: @NeroZero88 yeah I felt that the puzzle wasn't as bad as people made it seem. And didn't think the dungeon was too long either but others felt differently
[2017-05-29 19:40:26 UTC] bobbi_ling: you need some dsp wallpaper
[2017-05-29 19:40:28 UTC] nerozero88: true

[2017-05-29 19:41:00 UTC] bobbi_ling: ohnn*
[2017-05-29 19:41:05 UTC] akioartorius: Is it true that Phil actually sold Darksydephil thongs? or was that just a funny joke?
[2017-05-29 19:41:06 UTC] sonicsergey: lol
[2017-05-29 19:41:06 UTC] taurusoxford: Lol
[2017-05-29 19:41:08 UTC] blue_blur64: Well Kushi, I'd say this dungeon is a bit long, but still not too bad
[2017-05-29 19:41:11 UTC] pcgamehunter: Watch he'll say Reh MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:41:17 UTC] electrumguy: lol
[2017-05-29 19:41:18 UTC] avramph: @DarksydePhil use haru and see her all out attack finisher
[2017-05-29 19:41:27 UTC] blue_blur64: Definitely not the longest palace :D
[2017-05-29 19:41:31 UTC] akioartorius: Haru has a infinite combo I think
[2017-05-29 19:41:34 UTC] pcgamehunter: I know for sure it was on the store once Akio, but ain't it still there :D ?
[2017-05-29 19:41:37 UTC] aroman318: cheer10 careful phil this dungeon is very tough and dumb
[2017-05-29 19:41:41 UTC] taurusoxford: @AvramPH her all-out attack is why she's on my team
[2017-05-29 19:41:45 UTC] kushiyakitori: @blue_blur64 I think its the longest up till this point in the story but I'd say 7 is far too long for my taste
[2017-05-29 19:41:59 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: lol
[2017-05-29 19:41:59 UTC] derichloveslemur: @darksydephil I've been wondering who has the group healing move?

[2017-05-29 19:42:39 UTC] derichloveslemur: @darksydephil who has the group healing spell is morgana?
[2017-05-29 19:42:41 UTC] pcgamehunter: This dungeon has probably the coolest puzzle segments, but the enemies can be a pain if you're not strong enough
[2017-05-29 19:42:41 UTC] lion_o_: yooooo
[2017-05-29 19:42:48 UTC] 17max93: lffnW

[2017-05-29 19:44:02 UTC] sonicsergey: Platinum is better
[2017-05-29 19:44:04 UTC] kushiyakitori: makoto as well
[2017-05-29 19:44:05 UTC] eplegutten: nah its more bronce
[2017-05-29 19:44:05 UTC] blue_blur64: @Derichloveslemur Both Morgana and Makoto learn group healing spells, but Morgana gets the best one
[2017-05-29 19:44:15 UTC] derichloveslemur: Morgana oh ok.
[2017-05-29 19:44:18 UTC] blue_blur64: But it's always good to have options
[2017-05-29 19:44:33 UTC] pcgamehunter: Honestly the top abilities are shit in this game
[2017-05-29 19:44:38 UTC] aroman318: @SonicSergey pokemon platinum? i agree

[2017-05-29 19:44:55 UTC] pcgamehunter: They use like 2+ times the mana for maybe 1/4 damage boost ... :/
[2017-05-29 19:44:56 UTC] derichloveslemur: @blue_blur64 thx for telling me that morgana has the better group healing spell I didn't know that tiL now.
[2017-05-29 19:45:01 UTC] totallynotaviewbot1992: wow
[2017-05-29 19:45:15 UTC] aroman318: lol @SonicSergey im just having fun
[2017-05-29 19:45:15 UTC] taurusoxford: @Bobbi_Ling ...Pokemon how?
[2017-05-29 19:45:25 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter I started to skip the "severe" damage stuff. Cost is too high to me
[2017-05-29 19:45:30 UTC] sonicsergey: TehePelo Squid4 I see lol
[2017-05-29 19:45:32 UTC] derichloveslemur: @aroman318 is this dungeon really dumb?
[2017-05-29 19:45:45 UTC] katexo234: Pikachu MorphinTime
[2017-05-29 19:45:49 UTC] bobbi_ling: you collect pokemon. you collect personas. they both begin with P MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:45:54 UTC] pcgamehunter: Yeah I had to remove them on MC to beat the NG+ boss, the costs was fucking insane
[2017-05-29 19:45:57 UTC] aroman318: @Derichloveslemur oh yea at least for me
[2017-05-29 19:45:59 UTC] akioartorius: in front of you pHil

[2017-05-29 19:46:56 UTC] derichloveslemur: In this game.
[2017-05-29 19:47:01 UTC] vince329: Nintendo is gonna have Shin Megami Tensei
[2017-05-29 19:47:07 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's fucking evil tho :D
[2017-05-29 19:47:08 UTC] akioartorius: @DarksydePhil you should check out Haru's all out attack
[2017-05-29 19:47:12 UTC] vince329: either spinoff or the next mainline
[2017-05-29 19:47:18 UTC] pcgamehunter: Haru's all out is great :P
[2017-05-29 19:47:19 UTC] blue_blur64: Hey, it was a fair fight pc :P
[2017-05-29 19:47:23 UTC] derichloveslemur: @akioartorius what is her all out attack?
[2017-05-29 19:47:24 UTC] nerozero88: @vince329 Nintendo has quite a few of them
[2017-05-29 19:47:25 UTC] lvlpower: Mario Duty
[2017-05-29 19:47:27 UTC] pcgamehunter: @blue_blur64 HAHHAHAAA MingLee

[2017-05-29 19:47:51 UTC] howlingwolfjoey: nintendo has SMT series and persona Q , so...
[2017-05-29 19:47:51 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's not a fair fight unless they have limited SP like I do
[2017-05-29 19:47:57 UTC] akioartorius: @Derichloveslemur her finisher or the follow up?
[2017-05-29 19:47:58 UTC] vince329: yeah. Strange Journey, Devil Survivor, SMTIV, and the new one for the switch
[2017-05-29 19:48:01 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm not joking though pc, the AI is smart so as long as you switch out characters to avoid them getting a 1 more/ baton pass :P
[2017-05-29 19:48:04 UTC] bobbi_ling: futaba would fit in jet set radio
[2017-05-29 19:48:12 UTC] vince329: I would totally love to have a new Raidou game though
[2017-05-29 19:48:15 UTC] avramph: you had 843782347 chances
[2017-05-29 19:48:16 UTC] blue_blur64: You can win
[2017-05-29 19:48:25 UTC] vince329: ft. Dante from DMC
[2017-05-29 19:48:25 UTC] derichloveslemur: @neospartanhesperos9 does Futaba look like chameleon with those goggles she has on ATM.
[2017-05-29 19:48:26 UTC] leonaras: @DarksydePhil You making sauce again any time soon?
[2017-05-29 19:48:30 UTC] pcgamehunter: True the AI doesn't act stupid, but when you have unlimited SP and unblockable instakills, I call bs on fiar
[2017-05-29 19:48:31 UTC] pcgamehunter: fair*
[2017-05-29 19:48:50 UTC] kushiyakitori: I just realized that Phil probably passed a gem monster. Assuming they do spawn in the same spots
[2017-05-29 19:48:51 UTC] blue_blur64: But they didn't use instakill moves on me O_O
[2017-05-29 19:48:55 UTC] pcgamehunter: what difficulty you play at ?
[2017-05-29 19:48:58 UTC] aroman318: oh this is part 1 of the BS of this dungeon
[2017-05-29 19:49:02 UTC] blue_blur64: I was playing on normal
[2017-05-29 19:49:06 UTC] pcgamehunter: Yeah I was on hard
[2017-05-29 19:49:08 UTC] akioartorius: @KushiYakitori prob
[2017-05-29 19:49:19 UTC] derichloveslemur: @kushiyakitori what is a gem monster can you elaborate on it more?
[2017-05-29 19:49:35 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh, they randomly spawn Kushi
[2017-05-29 19:49:35 UTC] deep_drive: If there isn't bs in the game it can't be a jrpg Aroman318 Kappa
[2017-05-29 19:49:38 UTC] nerozero88: @derichloveslemur it yields higher exp and money
[2017-05-29 19:49:39 UTC] kushiyakitori: @akioartorius guess he might see it in mementos. oh well. @Derichloveslemur special personas that can't be used
[2017-05-29 19:49:41 UTC] pcgamehunter: They heal and revive all the time and have an ability that will down you instantly and can't be blocked and futaba doesn't do anything since it doesn't do damage and you know what happens during their all out attack :D
[2017-05-29 19:49:50 UTC] kushiyakitori: @blue_blur64 ah okay. I thought in each run they had the same spot. my bad
[2017-05-29 19:49:54 UTC] derichloveslemur: @kushiyakitori oh special personas ooh
[2017-05-29 19:49:57 UTC] nerozero88: can also be used for better fusions and executions
[2017-05-29 19:49:59 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Deep_Drive True-er words have not been spoken MingLEe
[2017-05-29 19:50:00 UTC] pcgamehunter: MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:50:04 UTC] derichloveslemur: @nerozero88 Yields?
[2017-05-29 19:50:05 UTC] blue_blur64: No, they only heal once from my experience
[2017-05-29 19:50:16 UTC] pcgamehunter: Dude don't test me MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:50:18 UTC] kushiyakitori: so he can still get the one for this palace. my mistake
[2017-05-29 19:50:25 UTC] pcgamehunter: They healed 4 times and revived anytime one died
[2017-05-29 19:50:26 UTC] gxpopcorn69: Turn Left
[2017-05-29 19:50:28 UTC] bobbi_ling: charm heals from persona 3? Kappa
[2017-05-29 19:50:38 UTC] derichloveslemur: @kushiyakitori Gem monsters sound interesting
[2017-05-29 19:50:40 UTC] pcgamehunter: I have been mentally scarred by it MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:50:47 UTC] nerozero88: @derichloveslemur yields = gives
[2017-05-29 19:51:02 UTC] vlayer: The NG+ boss isn't too bad, even on Hard. The Reaper is a much bigger challenge
[2017-05-29 19:51:09 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm speaking on my experience. They healed each other once, then they revived each other to 50% once. You just learn that you have to defeat them on the same turn. Also I never saw their all out attack xD
[2017-05-29 19:51:15 UTC] derichloveslemur: @nerozero88 oh the gives I understand now.
[2017-05-29 19:51:18 UTC] nerozero88: @vlayer i have yet to find a reaper
[2017-05-29 19:51:21 UTC] kushiyakitori: @Vlayer I cheesed out the reaper on NG and first run
[2017-05-29 19:51:32 UTC] akioartorius: @DarksydePhil all the robots in this dungeon is weak to a different element and resist to most others
[2017-05-29 19:51:38 UTC] pcgamehunter: All out attack means instaloss blue
[2017-05-29 19:51:39 UTC] vlayer: @NeroZero88 You have to stay on the same Mementos floor for a while

[2017-05-29 19:52:16 UTC] conky89: Donuts? Sundaes? Chocolate bars?
[2017-05-29 19:52:16 UTC] pcgamehunter: And they healed to max in my fight, until the last revive which was only 50%
[2017-05-29 19:52:16 UTC] nerozero88: @vlayer oh ok i thougbt it was mementos in general, not just 1 floor
[2017-05-29 19:52:17 UTC] mfd4419: Farts ;p
[2017-05-29 19:52:23 UTC] blue_blur64: It makes sense that different robot types have different weaknesses
[2017-05-29 19:52:28 UTC] vlayer: I don't dislike this dungeon as much as others, but it's probably my least favorite of the bunch
[2017-05-29 19:52:31 UTC] akioartorius: @Deep_Drive if I remember correctly
[2017-05-29 19:52:37 UTC] derichloveslemur: Gosh I hate trolls. This guy saltyfordrive said I'm about to get banned lol
[2017-05-29 19:52:46 UTC] blue_blur64: That's the same on normal pc
[2017-05-29 19:52:47 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: Sounds fair SeemsGood
[2017-05-29 19:52:51 UTC] deep_drive: yeah silent thats true just gotta make sure you've gota all your elements covered
[2017-05-29 19:52:53 UTC] blue_blur64: But they still only healed each other once :P
[2017-05-29 19:53:07 UTC] pcgamehunter: I mean they revived with 100% till the last time which was only 50%
[2017-05-29 19:53:12 UTC] pcgamehunter: That was like 2.5h in MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:53:17 UTC] blue_blur64: But funny thing is pc, I almost died on the last turn :P
[2017-05-29 19:53:24 UTC] vince329: Phil should know the cover system isn't that bad... you could basically get hidden from everything
[2017-05-29 19:53:36 UTC] avramph: @DarksydePhil phil haru all out attack please
[2017-05-29 19:53:42 UTC] derichloveslemur: @blue_blur64 @neospartanhesperos9 @deep_drive I really do hate trolls like this saltyfordrive guy who says I'm about to get banned and keeps making these accounts.
[2017-05-29 19:53:44 UTC] blue_blur64: I lost 2 characters and was very low health, but Futaba used Emergency Switch and I did just enough damage to win :P
[2017-05-29 19:53:46 UTC] omgzelda: the controls are so wonky in this game it takes awhile to get used to em - that said isnt he like 60 hours in?
[2017-05-29 19:53:46 UTC] kushiyakitori: Should have done all out attack after getting the money
[2017-05-29 19:53:52 UTC] pcgamehunter: I almost died a few times at the beginning then I just got so mad I countered whatever they threw at me :D
[2017-05-29 19:54:05 UTC] deep_drive: yeah i already reported him to twitch for chat ban evasion derich
[2017-05-29 19:54:05 UTC] pcgamehunter: Futaba is MVP in this game
[2017-05-29 19:54:10 UTC] mizorelover: He's getting shit for EXP cause he's taking all these bribes. :/

[2017-05-29 19:54:12 UTC] bobbi_ling: what did you name the character pc?
[2017-05-29 19:54:23 UTC] vlayer: Ryuji totally clutched my victory against the NG+ boss with God Hand, because my Hassou Tobi missed one of them when they had no health left
[2017-05-29 19:54:28 UTC] deep_drive: just keep blocking his accounts
[2017-05-29 19:54:29 UTC] cantsaltmenow: i did nothing wrong, deep_drive is in the wrong here
[2017-05-29 19:54:33 UTC] derichloveslemur: How often are there trolls?
[2017-05-29 19:54:40 UTC] pcgamehunter: I called him Akira Kurusu in the second playthrough, since that was his "canon" name
[2017-05-29 19:54:45 UTC] akioartorius: most of the time
[2017-05-29 19:54:54 UTC] derichloveslemur: Ban evasion?

[2017-05-29 19:55:09 UTC] pcgamehunter: I called him Lupin Shujinko the first time MingLee Shujinko meaning protagonist
[2017-05-29 19:55:12 UTC] akioartorius: Minato Arisato, Yu Narukami, Akira Kurusu
[2017-05-29 19:55:28 UTC] warmstrudel: u suck dumbass
[2017-05-29 19:55:28 UTC] pcgamehunter: I don't care about trophies blue
[2017-05-29 19:55:29 UTC] blue_blur64: Because I still need to get the all confidants maxed trophy. But I'm saving it for my merciless difficulty run :P
[2017-05-29 19:55:36 UTC] derichloveslemur: @sanguinenite hey bud I hate trolls.
[2017-05-29 19:55:42 UTC] pcgamehunter: I checked once halfway through 2nd pl I had like 66%
[2017-05-29 19:55:55 UTC] kysen: i called my character lupin the 3rd
[2017-05-29 19:55:56 UTC] pcgamehunter: If it activated correctly I have that one
[2017-05-29 19:56:00 UTC] vlayer: I wonder if the inevitable anime adaptation is going to give Joker a different name
[2017-05-29 19:56:03 UTC] pcgamehunter: Kysen MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:56:07 UTC] bobbi_ling: pretty sure todays "haters" is one person lol
[2017-05-29 19:56:13 UTC] blue_blur64: There's already an anime adaptation
[2017-05-29 19:56:18 UTC] mfd4419: Are you on your second play through @blue_blur64
[2017-05-29 19:56:19 UTC] akioartorius: ova
[2017-05-29 19:56:20 UTC] sanguinenite: @Derichloveslemur yeah I cant stand how logic seems to be beyond their understanding. They are definitely annoying.
[2017-05-29 19:56:23 UTC] pcgamehunter: Honestly not sure if they'll do an anime adaption past the daybreak one
[2017-05-29 19:56:25 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: Kill that republican SwiftRage
[2017-05-29 19:56:29 UTC] deep_drive: might be two bobbi but you are right bobbi

[2017-05-29 19:56:43 UTC] sonicsergey: survived with one hp
[2017-05-29 19:56:45 UTC] vlayer: @blue_blur64 Just an OVA, and IIRC they only call him by Joker
[2017-05-29 19:56:48 UTC] nerozero88: @airhead793d2jsp 💦💦💦💦💦💦

[2017-05-29 19:57:15 UTC] randomron005: Vague!
[2017-05-29 19:57:17 UTC] pcgamehunter: I honestly don't like the style of the animation studio that does the animations
[2017-05-29 19:57:24 UTC] pcgamehunter: It slightly distorts the look of the characters
[2017-05-29 19:57:28 UTC] vlayer: Knowing their dislieks is equally important
[2017-05-29 19:57:30 UTC] blue_blur64: I've already did everything I can, even getting every Persona in the game
[2017-05-29 19:57:31 UTC] derichloveslemur: @darksydephil vague?
[2017-05-29 19:57:32 UTC] mfd4419: Wow I'm still on my first at the end
[2017-05-29 19:57:32 UTC] akioartorius: upbeat = jokes, gloomy = vague, timid = kind, irritable = serious
[2017-05-29 19:57:32 UTC] pcgamehunter: Futaba especially
[2017-05-29 19:57:34 UTC] vlayer: dislikes*
[2017-05-29 19:57:38 UTC] derichloveslemur: Is it vague I can't remember
[2017-05-29 19:57:54 UTC] pcgamehunter: Just wing it MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:57:55 UTC] kushiyakitori: first answer doesn't matter
[2017-05-29 19:57:58 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: that he's old and covering his wrinkles
[2017-05-29 19:57:59 UTC] vince329: i usually just wing it
[2017-05-29 19:58:02 UTC] pcgamehunter: That's what I did, since I couldn't understand the Japanese
[2017-05-29 19:58:07 UTC] sanguinenite: @Bobbi_Ling The guys that is making successive accounts probably is the same person but I am sure they take turns to troll
[2017-05-29 19:58:09 UTC] derichloveslemur: Gloomy is still young maybe
[2017-05-29 19:58:22 UTC] xgameofpwns: bugged game

[2017-05-29 19:58:40 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: in Japanese they would make sense MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:58:41 UTC] derichloveslemur: upbeat = jokes, gloomy = vague, timid = kind, irritable = serious. Yeah here ya go.
[2017-05-29 19:58:41 UTC] pcgamehunter: Does the game tell you ?
[2017-05-29 19:58:43 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: LAME!

[2017-05-29 19:58:52 UTC] sanguinenite: I think it was option 3
[2017-05-29 19:58:53 UTC] taurusoxford: LAAAAAAME
[2017-05-29 19:58:57 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Vague Answers SwiftRage
[2017-05-29 19:58:57 UTC] vince329: @pcgamehunter it's just traditional SMT stuff.
[2017-05-29 19:59:06 UTC] vlayer: You need to know their dislikes as well to eliminate the wrong answers
[2017-05-29 19:59:11 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: "why cant i get it first try. BULLSHIT, DOOD!"
[2017-05-29 19:59:13 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Kappa
[2017-05-29 19:59:16 UTC] derichloveslemur: Lame!
[2017-05-29 19:59:18 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's either badly translated or just really dumb then
[2017-05-29 19:59:19 UTC] vince329: for Gloomy, instead of vague, I try to go for more optimistic or honest answers instead. usually still works
[2017-05-29 19:59:28 UTC] mfd4419: Deep if this helps u any this is my first account ever
[2017-05-29 19:59:30 UTC] blue_blur64: The game has literal translations pc
[2017-05-29 19:59:34 UTC] pcgamehunter: I know
[2017-05-29 19:59:45 UTC] pcgamehunter: After all Ann can speak english well MingLee
[2017-05-29 19:59:52 UTC] blue_blur64: So it's mostly just having Japanese stuff not translating to English well
[2017-05-29 19:59:58 UTC] pcgamehunter: "It's in English!" Ryuji MingLee
[2017-05-29 20:00:02 UTC] kysen: i played and finished the japanese version and the recruit system didn't make sense either. So its not a translation problem
[2017-05-29 20:00:04 UTC] poop_jpeg: Beep boop bop
[2017-05-29 20:00:05 UTC] mizorelover: inb4 he fails miserably.
[2017-05-29 20:00:18 UTC] conky89: We have soap
[2017-05-29 20:00:28 UTC] pcgamehunter: @blue_blur64 That makes sense for when you're doing a JP VA with subtitles, not when for a english dub tho ....
[2017-05-29 20:00:34 UTC] akioartorius: special soap?
[2017-05-29 20:00:36 UTC] mfd4419: Dame how many people in here already beat the game
[2017-05-29 20:00:41 UTC] mfd4419: Lol
[2017-05-29 20:00:44 UTC] deep_drive: yeah normal people don't have to make new accounts mfd it's just people who troll
[2017-05-29 20:00:45 UTC] derichloveslemur: @deep_drive we should get this troll banned forever!
[2017-05-29 20:00:50 UTC] blue_blur64: A lot since the game came out almost 2 months ago :P
[2017-05-29 20:00:58 UTC] akioartorius: Did Phil ever sell his junk?
[2017-05-29 20:01:02 UTC] taurusoxford: @mfd4419 i'm at the end of NG+
[2017-05-29 20:01:07 UTC] deep_drive: go to his channel and report him for ban evasion that should speed up the process derich
[2017-05-29 20:01:07 UTC] blue_blur64: It was the number one game in Europe for a week or two

[2017-05-29 20:02:57 UTC] katexo234: oh shoes phil
[2017-05-29 20:03:00 UTC] blue_blur64: You're suffering from Hunger so you can't do all out attacks
[2017-05-29 20:03:00 UTC] sanguinenite: I miss the days when spongebob was funny

[2017-05-29 20:03:55 UTC] aroman318: @pcgamehunter no fear
[2017-05-29 20:04:10 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter Easier to treat but still pretty annoying if its the first time you see it and you think it only takes SP lol.
[2017-05-29 20:04:12 UTC] pcgamehunter: I basically had no method of curing hunger without Haru, or using the items that cure all ailements :/
[2017-05-29 20:04:26 UTC] pcgamehunter: And I had like 6 of those
[2017-05-29 20:04:30 UTC] poop_jpeg: I find mouseification to be the worst
[2017-05-29 20:04:39 UTC] pcgamehunter: I was like level 60 at this point and hunger alone just destroyed me MingLee
[2017-05-29 20:04:45 UTC] katexo234: these bosses are so wacky lol
[2017-05-29 20:04:49 UTC] akioartorius: @DarksydePhil funny story Phil, during the Wataba boss fight if you had phys wall on everyone when she does the dive attack, she knocks herself out.
[2017-05-29 20:05:05 UTC] pcgamehunter: @akioartorius seriously MingLee ?
[2017-05-29 20:05:10 UTC] pcgamehunter: That's brilliant XD

[2017-05-29 20:56:45 UTC] akioartorius: or was it ice?
[2017-05-29 20:56:50 UTC] freecubeman: you'll never see it coming
[2017-05-29 20:56:52 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he was a little too OTT dragin

[2017-05-29 20:57:05 UTC] podusmonens: a little too aspergery
[2017-05-29 20:57:11 UTC] jx136: those personas tho. needs more variety
[2017-05-29 20:57:13 UTC] blue_blur64: there is no other stream today
[2017-05-29 20:57:18 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh, it is wind then xD
[2017-05-29 20:57:24 UTC] shekelbergosteinwitz: I'M FUCKING CUMMIN'

[2017-05-29 20:57:41 UTC] betheallen: jimmy ive been timed out by ichigo hundreds of times then bassoon did it and then gino except gino started banning
[2017-05-29 20:57:49 UTC] pcgamehunter: Meh I remember Hidden being alright, the modding might have broken him tho :P
[2017-05-29 20:57:50 UTC] popsicolo: I remember needing a specific lineup for this Palace's boss. It'll be fun to see how Phil fares.
[2017-05-29 20:57:54 UTC] salazarnaruto52: for those that have beaten both P4 and P5, which do you like more?
[2017-05-29 20:57:56 UTC] podusmonens: no, he's just a silly goose
[2017-05-29 20:57:59 UTC] darkviking159: thx @blue_blur64
[2017-05-29 20:58:01 UTC] euffy: P4
[2017-05-29 20:58:10 UTC] blue_blur64: P5
[2017-05-29 20:58:12 UTC] zeronarukami: @salazarnaruto52 p5
[2017-05-29 20:58:13 UTC] blue_blur64: But both are great
[2017-05-29 20:58:18 UTC] pcgamehunter: Honestly the best line up is the first 3 characters, since Ann does most magic damage, Ryuji most physical and Morgana is teh best healer
[2017-05-29 20:58:25 UTC] mfd4419: 3 MingLee
[2017-05-29 20:58:36 UTC] howlingwolfjoey: story tbh has to go to P4
[2017-05-29 20:58:39 UTC] cz75lover: nah Makoto is a better healer plus she has both phys and nuke attacks
[2017-05-29 20:58:40 UTC] mfd4419: My incomplete run MingLee
[2017-05-29 20:58:40 UTC] akioartorius: Shin megami tensei
[2017-05-29 20:58:40 UTC] pcgamehunter: With Yosuke as backup physical and Makoto as backup healer
[2017-05-29 20:58:41 UTC] betheallen: im pretty sure pops, silent and vidar have timed me out as well now i think about it
[2017-05-29 20:58:42 UTC] betheallen: :D
[2017-05-29 20:58:42 UTC] salazarnaruto52: haha I would still have to say P4 but both are masterpieces
[2017-05-29 20:58:44 UTC] ashghanistan: p5
[2017-05-29 20:58:47 UTC] jx136: P5. it had the better plot twist at the end imo
[2017-05-29 20:58:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: will he finish this dungeon today?
[2017-05-29 20:58:51 UTC] betheallen: wait deep has too
[2017-05-29 20:58:52 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: does this game ever finish? its lame
[2017-05-29 20:58:53 UTC] betheallen: fuck
[2017-05-29 20:58:54 UTC] kaledolta: Why is this guy coughing so much, is he in poor health or something?
[2017-05-29 20:58:55 UTC] euffy: A healer with an elemental weakness is a liability imo. MC is the best healer.
[2017-05-29 20:58:55 UTC] mr_tobi1018: anyone elss love the fact that phil gives us high quality raw footage
[2017-05-29 20:58:57 UTC] silverlining13: I liked the characters in P4 more, but i like P5's story more
[2017-05-29 20:58:57 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Deep timed me out BeTheAllen :(
[2017-05-29 20:58:58 UTC] bobbi_ling: #modchat
[2017-05-29 20:58:58 UTC] pcgamehunter: @CZ75Lover Morgana has lucky punch, which is way better than anything Makoto can do
[2017-05-29 20:59:00 UTC] betheallen: and people say im a SUCK UP
[2017-05-29 20:59:06 UTC] bobbi_ling: u r
[2017-05-29 20:59:08 UTC] salazarnaruto52: @silverlining13 same

[2017-05-29 20:59:11 UTC] blue_blur64: Just throat clearing kale
[2017-05-29 20:59:18 UTC] salazarnaruto52: i liked P4's soundtrack more as well
[2017-05-29 20:59:23 UTC] deep_drive: lol i banned you too bethe
[2017-05-29 20:59:24 UTC] mfd4419: Deep
[2017-05-29 20:59:25 UTC] pcgamehunter: If you give Morgana lucky items he basically never misses :P
[2017-05-29 20:59:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it still felt like a knife in the back deep
[2017-05-29 20:59:52 UTC] betheallen: jim what did phil BANNING you feel like
[2017-05-29 20:59:52 UTC] bobbi_ling: you need a turtle shell jimmy
[2017-05-29 20:59:53 UTC] pcgamehunter: Was it Deep jimbob Kappa ?
[2017-05-29 20:59:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: OF COURSE SwiftRage
[2017-05-29 20:59:56 UTC] akioartorius: misss? -Phil
[2017-05-29 20:59:59 UTC] silverlining13: nevermore is amazing and face yourself
[2017-05-29 21:00:00 UTC] conky89: MISS?
[2017-05-29 21:00:03 UTC] pcgamehunter: Or just a flesh wound MingLee
[2017-05-29 21:00:03 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: such riveting gameplay
[2017-05-29 21:00:08 UTC] ggsthatwasme: Why does Phil not baton pass at all? NotLikeThis
[2017-05-29 21:00:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: cahman PC :D
[2017-05-29 21:00:13 UTC] kushiyakitori: why not knock over the one in the middle and all out?
[2017-05-29 21:00:13 UTC] kaledolta: But he seems to be clearing his throat all of the time, I don't know just seems a little worrisome to me
[2017-05-29 21:00:18 UTC] euffy: Baton Pass too OP
[2017-05-29 21:00:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :D Bobbi
[2017-05-29 21:00:31 UTC] pcgamehunter: @theycallmejimbob sorry EleGiggle
[2017-05-29 21:00:50 UTC] pcgamehunter: @DarksydePhil Her mom isn't french she's just designed stereo-typically as a french lady
[2017-05-29 21:00:52 UTC] popsicolo: Oh that reminds me, you should read the bio of Haru's Persona if you get the chance, Phil.
[2017-05-29 21:00:55 UTC] blue_blur64: The bigger question is, where does she get the table and the tea set?
[2017-05-29 21:00:56 UTC] akioartorius: its a shame we won't see the twins' all out attack
[2017-05-29 21:00:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: BeTheAllen that was a misclick :( there was malice behind Deep's ban :(
[2017-05-29 21:01:10 UTC] bobbi_ling: ryder twins?
[2017-05-29 21:01:10 UTC] pcgamehunter: @blue_blur64 persona MingLee
[2017-05-29 21:01:10 UTC] cz75lover: Ann is the only party member who's foreign actually
[2017-05-29 21:01:16 UTC] vlayer: @blue_blur64 Something something cognition
[2017-05-29 21:01:17 UTC] pcgamehunter: Teasona Kappa

[2017-05-29 21:01:56 UTC] blue_blur64: I love the backup follow up attacks :D
[2017-05-29 21:01:57 UTC] deep_drive: no malice here jimbob
[2017-05-29 21:02:05 UTC] theycallmejimbob: suuuure deep Kappa
[2017-05-29 21:02:06 UTC] salazarnaruto52: I thought Ann was just 1/4 american
[2017-05-29 21:02:15 UTC] taurusoxford: Ann is 1/4 american
[2017-05-29 21:02:22 UTC] betheallen: i provoked deep enough for a time out
[2017-05-29 21:02:28 UTC] pcgamehunter: Again the characters might be designed to look foreign, but there is nothing stating they're not fully Japanese
[2017-05-29 21:02:32 UTC] pcgamehunter: Ann did live abroad tho
[2017-05-29 21:02:56 UTC] kingjezal: All the weebs hate Ann because of the 'murican blood in her veins.
[2017-05-29 21:02:58 UTC] akioartorius: @blue_blur64 its still a shame though
[2017-05-29 21:03:06 UTC] bobbi_ling: poor ohnn
[2017-05-29 21:03:11 UTC] cz75lover: *Finnish actually
[2017-05-29 21:03:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: They're all Japanese FailFish
[2017-05-29 21:03:16 UTC] salazarnaruto52: Who was everybody's girl in the game? Mine was Makoto
[2017-05-29 21:03:23 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's Bethesda/Arkane all over again goddamit you people
[2017-05-29 21:03:26 UTC] cz75lover: Hifumi, baby
[2017-05-29 21:03:26 UTC] vlayer: Pretty sure Ann is partly Finnish as well, considering her parents are in Finland according to her Confidant and her name sounds Finnish too
[2017-05-29 21:03:27 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh, you have to go the long way around for that one guy
[2017-05-29 21:03:29 UTC] euffy: Futaba is the only right answer for grill
[2017-05-29 21:03:32 UTC] whalekerminsouijaboard: im not a virgin I didnt have a girl
[2017-05-29 21:03:39 UTC] akioartorius: Hifumi should have been a character though
[2017-05-29 21:03:42 UTC] bobbi_ling: haru is best character
[2017-05-29 21:03:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: OF COURSE SwiftRage
[2017-05-29 21:03:46 UTC] pcgamehunter: My first choice was Futaba, went with Makoto the second time. They're all good imo
[2017-05-29 21:03:56 UTC] kingjezal: Ann is the only answer.
[2017-05-29 21:03:57 UTC] pcgamehunter: Unlike YUKIKO MingLee
[2017-05-29 21:03:59 UTC] blue_blur64: Ann the first, Futaba the second
[2017-05-29 21:04:02 UTC] pcgamehunter: Fuck yukiko
[2017-05-29 21:04:11 UTC] popsicolo: They're all good, except for Ohya MingLee
[2017-05-29 21:04:15 UTC] pcgamehunter: IKR
[2017-05-29 21:04:16 UTC] kingjezal: Yukiko is social awkwardness cringe.
[2017-05-29 21:04:17 UTC] salazarnaruto52: For my second playthrough, I'm going with Tae Takemi
[2017-05-29 21:04:22 UTC] theycallmejimbob: instakill SwiftRage
[2017-05-29 21:04:29 UTC] pcgamehunter: Ohya is the sound I make when you mention her name
[2017-05-29 21:04:32 UTC] bufubae: Fun fact: Yukiko was originally planned to be the killer in persona 4
[2017-05-29 21:04:34 UTC] euffy: Lala would have been the best, but noooo. Ohya took her place.
[2017-05-29 21:04:38 UTC] pcgamehunter: Ohya, she exists ResidentSleeper
[2017-05-29 21:04:40 UTC] darkviking159: instant death
[2017-05-29 21:04:49 UTC] cz75lover: @bufubae either Yukiko or Dojima
[2017-05-29 21:04:59 UTC] cz75lover: they had plot drafts for both of them
[2017-05-29 21:05:04 UTC] kingjezal: Yukiko: "Erm, hi... snrk snrk snrk"
[2017-05-29 21:05:10 UTC] pcgamehunter: @bufubae would make more sense, since she has less personality and fucking adachi MingLee
[2017-05-29 21:05:12 UTC] howlingwolfjoey: Dojima 75lover
[2017-05-29 21:05:13 UTC] blue_blur64: There's a small gap between the glass wall and the boxes you can walk through
[2017-05-29 21:05:17 UTC] pcgamehunter: than*
[2017-05-29 21:05:18 UTC] salazarnaruto52: Yukiko's laugh was adorable
[2017-05-29 21:05:23 UTC] bobbi_ling: i bet that cat ends up being the best waifu MingLee
[2017-05-29 21:05:23 UTC] popsicolo: "I'm uncomfortable!" -Yukiko
[2017-05-29 21:05:25 UTC] kingjezal: @pcgamehunter Spoilers
[2017-05-29 21:05:28 UTC] blue_blur64: I messed that up my first time too, so don't worry about it too much
[2017-05-29 21:05:29 UTC] akioartorius: "Bona fided, Mona fided" -Futaba
[2017-05-29 21:05:36 UTC] vlayer: Poor Mothman BibleThump
[2017-05-29 21:05:36 UTC] pcgamehunter: Game is old
[2017-05-29 21:05:36 UTC] theycallmejimbob: just another 3 and a half weeks to go till the steam summer sale and for it to be another disappointment :(
[2017-05-29 21:06:09 UTC] betheallen: bobbi its meant to be a boy cat and he loves ann
[2017-05-29 21:06:10 UTC] salazarnaruto52: do rpgs have a time limit for spoilers?
[2017-05-29 21:06:20 UTC] akioartorius: yes? I think
[2017-05-29 21:06:21 UTC] pcgamehunter: nope
[2017-05-29 21:06:27 UTC] pcgamehunter: But people stop caring at some point
[2017-05-29 21:06:29 UTC] bobbi_ling: we dont know his gender beth
[2017-05-29 21:06:36 UTC] bobbi_ling: i bet its a girl

[2017-05-29 21:06:45 UTC] akioartorius: He is a car
[2017-05-29 21:06:46 UTC] kingjezal: Irrelevant if a game is old, which P4G isn't.
[2017-05-29 21:06:47 UTC] betheallen: bobbi fine but we know it loves ann
[2017-05-29 21:06:48 UTC] deep_drive: well morgana said it a boy
[2017-05-29 21:06:49 UTC] pcgamehunter: It was fucking explained twice now
[2017-05-29 21:06:55 UTC] blue_blur64: Morgana's a boy
[2017-05-29 21:06:58 UTC] deep_drive: but morgana doesn't know anything at this point
[2017-05-29 21:06:58 UTC] euffy: Morgana refers to himself as a male. Gotta go with that.
[2017-05-29 21:07:10 UTC] adc_pokerface123: play injustice
[2017-05-29 21:07:18 UTC] betheallen: deep and he probably has no dick

[2017-05-29 21:07:33 UTC] sonicsergey: has he left the dungeon yet?
[2017-05-29 21:07:41 UTC] kekon3: This is a very progressive game, where the gender can be whatever you want
[2017-05-29 21:07:46 UTC] cz75lover: @SonicSergey this is the most aggravating dungeon in the game, so no

[2017-05-29 21:09:42 UTC] pcgamehunter: Also in the JP version, Morgana uses a really old way of referring to oneself reserved mostly for men, so ...
[2017-05-29 21:09:46 UTC] kingjezal: When patrons nitpicked over Phil not doing the last microscopic 2% of P3... Phil was in the right there, not gonna lie.

[2017-05-29 21:11:28 UTC] silverlining13: i think people complained because that wanted to see Phil's reaction to the P3 ending
[2017-05-29 21:11:32 UTC] pcgamehunter: No they complained, because they use any tiny problem to call Phils character into question and thought "You played only 99% of the game means you didn't do anything"

[2017-05-29 21:25:40 UTC] ggsthatwasme: They always respawn when you go into a save room. That's the trade off for having a safe room + warping ability. It's not "archaic".

[2017-05-29 22:19:57 UTC] blue_blur64: The weapon is basically an I win button if you can get despair cast, since despair instakills after 3 turns

[2017-05-29 22:22:36 UTC] akioartorius: Phil should play Orphen Scion of Sorcery kappa
[2017-05-29 22:22:41 UTC] blue_blur64: It has to leave quite an impression for games early in the year to be remembered
[2017-05-29 22:22:42 UTC] kekon3: Tekken 7 might be up there too
[2017-05-29 22:22:47 UTC] jaxunhero: @pcgamehunter so you're a person of culture

[2017-05-29 23:11:14 UTC] blue_blur64: Ann is the closest :P

[2017-05-29 23:12:30 UTC] mitlaufer: persona 5 is the first game I enjoyed playing but which felt kinda meh after finishing it
[2017-05-29 23:12:49 UTC] blue_blur64: what made you feel meh?
[2017-05-29 23:12:54 UTC] blue_blur64: without spoiling of course
[2017-05-29 23:13:06 UTC] princeg103: Phil have u ever considered playing guilty gear
[2017-05-29 23:13:34 UTC] mitlaufer: I dont know, the second half just dragged on and on and on
[2017-05-29 23:13:57 UTC] blue_blur64: Was it your first Persona game?
[2017-05-29 23:13:57 UTC] mitlaufer: i just wanted to finish it already
[2017-05-29 23:14:02 UTC] mitlaufer: no
[2017-05-29 23:14:35 UTC] mitlaufer: I unironically prefered the rng dungeon style to the handcrafted design in p5
[2017-05-29 23:14:40 UTC] blue_blur64: Then there must've just been something that subconsciously annoyed you
[2017-05-29 23:14:57 UTC] blue_blur64: Or maybe it was the palaces as you just stated
[2017-05-29 23:15:13 UTC] mitlaufer: also the cast felt kinda boring, i only really liked yusuke
[2017-05-29 23:15:13 UTC] aloofone: would rather see some f 13th stream tonight rather then kogaming stuff
[2017-05-29 23:15:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: I actually felt great after beating it, just mad about the last 3 months :/
[2017-05-29 23:15:33 UTC] blue_blur64: I honestly enjoyed the game from beginning to end
[2017-05-29 23:15:44 UTC] blue_blur64: I'd have to nitpick to be negative about it xD
[2017-05-29 23:16:14 UTC] blue_blur64: But we all have our own feelings on it
[2017-05-29 23:16:15 UTC] mitlaufer: it was a fun game for sure
[2017-05-29 23:16:19 UTC] mitlaufer: yeah
[2017-05-29 23:16:32 UTC] mitlaufer: its definitely not a bad game
[2017-05-29 23:16:32 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm just happy the game sold so well
[2017-05-29 23:16:44 UTC] mitlaufer: just somewhat overrated, its just another persona game
[2017-05-29 23:16:58 UTC] mitlaufer: all out attacks are way too op by the way
[2017-05-29 23:17:04 UTC] blue_blur64: i think with Sega's quarterly earnings they said that Persona 5 and Warhammer combined sold like 13 million
[2017-05-29 23:17:16 UTC] mitlaufer: guess its all the small things that add together for me to feel "meh" at the end
[2017-05-29 23:17:55 UTC] pcgamehunter: i did think for how long the game was the ending seemed a bit rushed tho
[2017-05-29 23:18:05 UTC] mitlaufer: yeah, I just hope atlus wont milk the game too much
[2017-05-29 23:18:18 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's probably because they basically had to cut it suddenly when they realized they're taking too long.
[2017-05-29 23:18:26 UTC] mitlaufer: yeah, definitely a rushed and sudden ending
[2017-05-29 23:18:56 UTC] mitlaufer: which is odd because the last 1 or 2 dungeons felt so loong and dragged out
[2017-05-29 23:19:19 UTC] pcgamehunter: Welp I'm off cya guys
[2017-05-29 23:19:20 UTC] mitlaufer: definitely a weird pacing around the end
[2017-05-29 23:19:29 UTC] mitlaufer: yeah, have a nice day or evening, whatever
