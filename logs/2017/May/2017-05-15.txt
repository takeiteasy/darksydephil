[2017-05-15 03:37:40 UTC] manyperegrine81: Since he is just an affiliate
[2017-05-15 03:37:40 UTC] rnrs: its sadly funny
[2017-05-15 03:37:41 UTC] whiit3shadow: wtf is even this laveria? 2 accounts, one with no tweets, another with 13, holy shit the people that are praising them got played hard
[2017-05-15 03:37:41 UTC] grim_blades: You just learned this after 8 years on Youtube?
[2017-05-15 03:37:42 UTC] jwalker70: i know I spelt that wrong
[2017-05-15 03:37:43 UTC] gigixdarling: @Drilbit777 meh, I've seen better days but overall, good! long time no speak
[2017-05-15 03:37:47 UTC] clesstheangei: curse doesn't lose anything having phil as an affiliate. It's basically free money for them
[2017-05-15 03:37:50 UTC] andreii1984: laveria sound like bunch of snowflakes working together, lol
[2017-05-15 03:37:51 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: ok
[2017-05-15 03:37:58 UTC] manyperegrine81: @derichloveslemur nothing much man. Just been banned for a while.

[2017-05-15 03:38:00 UTC] flyeaglesfly01: @RnRs Yeah. Like I said. Nice life
[2017-05-15 03:38:00 UTC] hippostabber: phil should just go on the sok "ignoring" them for years have done nothing to hinder there popularity maybe he will earn some respect and win some old fans back
[2017-05-15 03:38:03 UTC] cholojoker69: @rnrs 7 hoirs though?? come on
[2017-05-15 03:38:04 UTC] derichloveslemur: @ClessTheAngeI Machinima or Curse?
[2017-05-15 03:38:04 UTC] rnrs: from phil to all the people that watch him and hate him
[2017-05-15 03:38:10 UTC] chem_zegarra2018: Sok have a seven hour stream talking about Phil.

[2017-05-15 03:38:21 UTC] rnrs: to be on the outside watching all of it is comical
[2017-05-15 03:38:23 UTC] daviddedavidson: Man, phil sure makes up some good stories. George R.R. Martin eat your heart out

[2017-05-15 03:38:31 UTC] hyperior21: @Whiit3ShaDow And then CEO' is Dan Warren @ They call me CEO
[2017-05-15 03:38:32 UTC] errnoent: Azotherian Well.. He has a point a lot of times. Surely you know how projects get rushed out the door and QA is an afterthought. Happens ALL the time in the game industry.
[2017-05-15 03:38:34 UTC] andreii1984: SOK have no life, lol 7 hour stream, wtf!?
[2017-05-15 03:38:34 UTC] ellietsantiara: Laveria isn't even a real company lol
[2017-05-15 03:38:37 UTC] rnrs: I mean obviously I do other things while this is open lmao
[2017-05-15 03:38:38 UTC] mr_lion_: I don't know if you guys know this but...SoK knows everything Phil is saying the CEO said on the interview that Phil was part on an affiliate.
[2017-05-15 03:38:42 UTC] dspfandood: whuuuuut
[2017-05-15 03:38:44 UTC] darthvidarviking: I think the story phil told checks completely outy

[2017-05-15 03:38:58 UTC] cholojoker69: @andreii1984 LMFAO!!!!
[2017-05-15 03:38:59 UTC] azotherian: @2B_Booty should be if(user==="DSP")...gotta compare exactly, not by type
[2017-05-15 03:38:59 UTC] misterstarz: YouTube adpocalypse 2017 dspSurpriseddsp
[2017-05-15 03:39:00 UTC] zahvone: Yep
[2017-05-15 03:39:01 UTC] onlinekombo: phil is upset because laveria wouldn't give him a free plate of ribs
[2017-05-15 03:39:05 UTC] mac_diesel1: @errnoent what? i have friends who work at google. not a single feature isn't extensively tested, integration, feature, end-to-end
[2017-05-15 03:39:06 UTC] flyeaglesfly01: @RnRs Sounds good
[2017-05-15 03:39:09 UTC] daviddedavidson: understood, you think DSP tells it how it is
[2017-05-15 03:39:11 UTC] hippostabber: remember all these bad decisions were the trolls fault i guess ...idk
[2017-05-15 03:39:15 UTC] derichloveslemur: Curse lol
[2017-05-15 03:39:18 UTC] whiit3shadow: @Hyperior21 i noticed, the fact thats its a play on phils twitter handle just adds on to the fact it was probably created to fuck him over lol
[2017-05-15 03:39:19 UTC] 2b_booty: @DavidDeDavidson phil could write novels about his experience with technology
[2017-05-15 03:39:22 UTC] manyperegrine81: @derichloveslemur for telling the truth on Phil. Apparently I was banned until 4/24. Besides I unfollow Phil as well. So I didn't know I was banned that long
[2017-05-15 03:39:22 UTC] ellietsantiara: @andreii1984 they don't just no have a life, they also don't have brains smh
[2017-05-15 03:39:27 UTC] hyperior21: @darthvidarviking. It is. Laveria ks absolutely a TROLL nob
[2017-05-15 03:39:34 UTC] drilbit777: @gigixdarling Thats pretty good hope you're doing alright
[2017-05-15 03:39:45 UTC] derichloveslemur: @ManyPeregrine81 Do you remember what you did or no?
[2017-05-15 03:39:46 UTC] azotherian: @errnoent but it's his attitude towards it. He makes it sound like he knows what to do
[2017-05-15 03:39:56 UTC] whiit3shadow: though i will admit, phil did walk into that one
[2017-05-15 03:39:56 UTC] andreii1984: Playing Prey on nightmare and it playing like Alien Isolation!
[2017-05-15 03:39:59 UTC] dspfandood: Phil crawling back PogChamp
[2017-05-15 03:40:01 UTC] azotherian: @errnoent like he can walk right in and code a patch for it
[2017-05-15 03:40:03 UTC] onlinekombo: @DarksydePhil I'll sign you to my new MCN. Signing bonus is a plate of ribs and a guide book on how to be a fully functioning responsible adult.
[2017-05-15 03:40:09 UTC] errnoent: @mac_diesel1 I wasn't talking about Google. Yeah, I also know people there and while that is true, it doesn't mean they didn't totally fuck up by ignoring the social aspects that make (made) YT successful.
[2017-05-15 03:40:13 UTC] yacherdy: Damn I need some alcohol
[2017-05-15 03:40:13 UTC] manyperegrine81: @derichloveslemur I think it was Personal Responsibility
[2017-05-15 03:40:17 UTC] daviddedavidson: also the podcast even discussed how Laveria would have affiliates give them people as partners. This is no big surprise.
[2017-05-15 03:40:17 UTC] unsungmasterworks: :tf:

[2017-05-15 03:40:36 UTC] manyperegrine81: @yacherdy tell me about it lol
[2017-05-15 03:40:42 UTC] ellietsantiara: @yacherdy I have some Brazilian tequila in the kitchen, my treat
[2017-05-15 03:40:42 UTC] mac_diesel1: @errnoent But phil is specifically saying that this feature wasn't tested, that's absolutely retarded
[2017-05-15 03:40:44 UTC] errnoent: @Azotherian I don't think you have to be an expert in a subject to recognize glaring mistakes
[2017-05-15 03:40:44 UTC] rnrs: twitch mobile app means I can go outside and smoke the weeds
[2017-05-15 03:40:47 UTC] daviddedavidson: It just surprises me the lengths DSP would go to not admit that he fucked up and went for the first MCN that contacted him
[2017-05-15 03:40:48 UTC] cholojoker69: Fred and Phil should have a civil podcast
[2017-05-15 03:40:49 UTC] thirtysixhundredcalories: Better than Machinima?

[2017-05-15 03:41:40 UTC] azotherian: @errnoent no, but he could give it as an issue and not expect them to stop everything and work on it. You know how sprints work
[2017-05-15 03:41:44 UTC] derichloveslemur: yeah thx for the advice Phil.
