[2017-06-28 01:32:43 UTC] eplegutten: ok
[2017-06-28 01:34:42 UTC] eplegutten: Since you are hosting or streaming from phil's channel, do that mean you know him?
[2017-06-28 01:35:16 UTC] eplegutten: Ok
[2017-06-28 01:35:55 UTC] eplegutten: I can proudly say im not a hater.
[2017-06-28 01:36:38 UTC] eplegutten: To be honest i dont know it all, but he gets alot of shit

[2017-06-28 01:38:01 UTC] eplegutten: I am probably to new to help out as a mod, but i would not mind helping if i could.
[2017-06-28 01:38:32 UTC] eplegutten: Since i live in Norway time difference is a bitch
[2017-06-28 01:38:45 UTC] eplegutten: But i do try to watch him now and then.
[2017-06-28 01:39:29 UTC] eplegutten: I guess there is aprox 6-7 hour difference.
[2017-06-28 01:40:01 UTC] zahvone: I don't know how you're able to catch the stream lol
[2017-06-28 01:40:20 UTC] eplegutten: Well if you like a streamer you do what you can.
[2017-06-28 01:41:12 UTC] eplegutten: streaming of games are suppose to be entertaining, and not full of drama and shit.
[2017-06-28 01:41:22 UTC] eplegutten: at least thats how i think about it.
[2017-06-28 01:41:27 UTC] zahvone: I definitely agree with you

[2017-06-28 01:44:32 UTC] eplegutten: He was a mod

[2017-06-28 01:45:01 UTC] eplegutten: trolls got to him.
[2017-06-28 01:46:15 UTC] eplegutten: I guess i can say something i have on my mind since its not a direct phil stream. But vidar told me about freedomchat.
[2017-06-28 01:46:40 UTC] eplegutten: And after i stood up for phil, even thoug he dont know that, i got banned.
[2017-06-28 01:47:03 UTC] eplegutten: But im kinda glad, that chat was pure cancer.
[2017-06-28 01:47:16 UTC] zahvone: I stay away from all of that chat, and those individuals as best I can lol

[2017-06-28 19:25:28 UTC] cresstheangel: problem is to ban people you have to see what they say
[2017-06-28 19:25:32 UTC] deep_drive: for this kinda game you kinda have to have chat closed
[2017-06-28 19:25:33 UTC] cresstheangel: therefore being spoiled
[2017-06-28 19:25:37 UTC] sensationalmedia: I'd prefer some more RDR. Now that's a hot stream. :P

[2017-06-28 19:26:07 UTC] inkrev_print: I want to see undead nightmare afterwards

[2017-06-28 19:26:12 UTC] halloween_x2k: effing hell. can't unsee that
[2017-06-28 19:26:15 UTC] darksydephil: well it's as ive said, if you're watching thi splaythrough and dont want to be spoiled, the ONLY way you can do that is to not read stream chat. i'd think those watching this game for the first time would probably prefer to watch on youtube to avoid the spoiler element
[2017-06-28 19:26:19 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Watch phil forget everything that happened so far
[2017-06-28 19:26:26 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: chat closed is best option, he's done it for the past Dangon playthrough and its worked fine, we're all cool with it.
[2017-06-28 19:26:37 UTC] ai_izumi: Nope

[2017-06-28 19:26:54 UTC] 6th_moral: sadly that means no shoutouts from bits or subs
[2017-06-28 19:26:56 UTC] yaslothy: There's nothing worth reading here anyway EleGiggle
[2017-06-28 19:26:57 UTC] darksydephil: yeah, the question is, will anyone cheer/sub/tip when they get no shout out for it. nobody did the first session besides 1 person
[2017-06-28 19:26:57 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: losenges are a type of hard sweet that you sook on, usually flavoured, some have a liquid centre to it - mainly used for sore throats @Kishq
[2017-06-28 19:27:02 UTC] midnight_strike_force: It won't bother me personally, having played the first two games and the shooter spin-off.
[2017-06-28 19:27:02 UTC] sensationalmedia: @theycallmejimbob Yeah, that sounds right to me. Kappa
[2017-06-28 19:27:31 UTC] midnight_strike_force: Speaking of which, that shooter spin-off was released for the PS4 last week. So... be careful for the next Patreon's Choice.
[2017-06-28 19:27:40 UTC] kishq: @hotsauceistoohot owh like cooughing candies(just translated the dutch word :P)
[2017-06-28 19:27:48 UTC] darksydephil: im doing this as today's main stream to make up fo rthe multiple missed sessions but theres no way i can do this as main stream every day
[2017-06-28 19:28:04 UTC] jackwhite202: so hows everyone?
[2017-06-28 19:28:10 UTC] chrisbreezy00: I mean you could nothing is stopping you
[2017-06-28 19:28:13 UTC] cresstheangel: its better as a night stream anyway i think
[2017-06-28 19:28:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah did the spin off just get released midnight_strike_force ?
[2017-06-28 19:28:25 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: Phil this is a Patreon goal, I thought the goal level for this game being played was to subsidise the potential loss of income through YT. But that was back when first launching Patreon - I suppose times have changed since. But I can see why some would be confused, it was never really re-clarified
[2017-06-28 19:28:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: good thanks jackwhite202 and yourself
[2017-06-28 19:28:26 UTC] ai_izumi: @jackwhite202 Well kinda crappy
[2017-06-28 19:28:39 UTC] jackwhite202: @theycallmejimbob im good
[2017-06-28 19:28:50 UTC] jackwhite202: @theycallmejimbob just finished season 2 of Attack on Titan
[2017-06-28 19:28:53 UTC] xthewrath93x: danganronpa is boring as fuck, i can see why DSP is reluctant to play it all the time
[2017-06-28 19:28:54 UTC] sensationalmedia: @chrisbreezy00 Too much reading, his voice would go out.
[2017-06-28 19:29:05 UTC] midnight_strike_force: @theycallmejimbob It sure did, Ultra Despair Girls I mean. It has a *ton* more gameplay than the main series, though it was made for the VITA so I'm sure it'll show.
[2017-06-28 19:29:13 UTC] cresstheangel: hes reluctant to play it cause he has to read it out loud lol
[2017-06-28 19:29:14 UTC] sanguinenite: even as much I like the game, danganronpa should be 2nd stream only
[2017-06-28 19:29:29 UTC] midnight_strike_force: Not that it's bad. It's just that a lot of VITA games are put on PS4 and you can usually tell they were made for the VITA.
[2017-06-28 19:29:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah cool jackwhite202 did you play the video game adaption of it
[2017-06-28 19:29:45 UTC] jackwhite202: @theycallmejimbob yes i did
[2017-06-28 19:29:50 UTC] chrisbreezy00: the Vita was a major fail
[2017-06-28 19:29:51 UTC] sensationalmedia: @xthewrath93x The patrons picked it. Patron's choices always seem to be hit or miss.
[2017-06-28 19:30:00 UTC] sensationalmedia: Low key trolls. :D
[2017-06-28 19:30:01 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh it just got released yesterday on steam midnight_strike_force
[2017-06-28 19:30:03 UTC] chrisbreezy00: The Vita is an example of a console failing because it only has weeb shit
[2017-06-28 19:30:13 UTC] darksydephil: hotsauceistoohot that's correct, you're referencing something i put into effect 2 years ago. now not only has YT ad revenue plummeted but i have to worry about the streams as well. so a long playthrough like Danganronpa 2 is a HUUUGE risk fo rme right now. next time i do patrons choice i hate to say it but i might have to limit the kind of games that can be nominated
[2017-06-28 19:30:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: we're live SwiftRage
[2017-06-28 19:30:18 UTC] taurusoxford: The Vita failed cause the memory card prices were absurd
[2017-06-28 19:30:28 UTC] jackwhite202: @theycallmejimbob i thought the game was ok
[2017-06-28 19:30:28 UTC] midnight_strike_force: And because supporting it was way too expensive ^
[2017-06-28 19:30:35 UTC] jackwhite202: @theycallmejimbob too much repetitive stuff
[2017-06-28 19:30:39 UTC] chrisbreezy00: What do you mean phil? Can you give an example of how that would look like???
[2017-06-28 19:30:45 UTC] dspfandood: Oh good more rules for patrons choice SeemsGood
[2017-06-28 19:30:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I suppose you'd have to be a big fan of the show to enjoy it jackwhite202

[2017-06-28 19:31:00 UTC] darksydephil: yeah, no long JRPGs or weeb games. because they win every patrons choice and take too fucking long, and dont bring in any attention

[2017-06-28 21:24:07 UTC] midnight_strike_force: Four.

[2017-06-28 21:24:50 UTC] midnight_strike_force: If he skips them though it'll go through fast. It's not a good idea though. Befriending gives you skill points.

[2017-06-28 21:25:32 UTC] endlessnine99: Trial is about as close to gameplay as you get. Oh yeah, and the escape room Phil will definitely skip.

[2017-06-28 21:25:49 UTC] vlayer: @Beat43210 It decides what abilities you learn, but other than that not really
[2017-06-28 21:25:50 UTC] masternutella: This is really a boring stream but h well
[2017-06-28 21:25:53 UTC] masternutella: *oh

[2017-06-28 21:27:24 UTC] midnight_strike_force: You can purchase skills using skill points gathered by talking to thee other characters, but if you fully befriend someone, they will give you a particularly good skill.

I grew up with that game, and I am willing to shell out a shit ton of money to buy a gaming pc, so I can emulate and keep playing it. That said, it hasn't aged well, and Phil mainly played fighting games during this game's era, so he is not familiar with old school 3D platforming.

[2017-06-28 23:47:56 UTC] midnight_strike_force: But yeah the story, while it is kinda good, it gets a bit much at certain points. I still enjoy it from time to time. Music was still great though.
[2017-06-28 23:48:06 UTC] midnight_strike_force: @Kinggoken "Yeah yeah yeah, YEAH YEAH YEAH"

[2017-06-28 23:49:54 UTC] proxycon: it isn't cause it just released
[2017-06-28 23:50:23 UTC] pcgamehunter: DR main series or ultra despair girls ?
[2017-06-28 23:50:27 UTC] proxycon: UDG
[2017-06-28 23:50:30 UTC] pcgamehunter: HAh
[2017-06-28 23:50:31 UTC] vlayer: I also recommend The Nonary Games, which has the first two Zero Escape games, 999 and Virtue's Last Reward. Crazy good story
[2017-06-28 23:50:44 UTC] crocodile090: Danganronpa duhhh
[2017-06-28 23:50:46 UTC] pcgamehunter: Those are pretty puzzle heavy I can't get into them MingLee
[2017-06-28 23:50:48 UTC] endlessnine99: Yeah, especially if you like playing the same game over and over and over again
[2017-06-28 23:50:57 UTC] endlessnine99: and doing the same puzzles over and over and over
[2017-06-28 23:51:08 UTC] endlessnine99: Just to reach a bad end
[2017-06-28 23:51:08 UTC] crocodile090: the fps in ultra despIr girls is a joke just play the main series
[2017-06-28 23:51:13 UTC] kodakcam: \come on
[2017-06-28 23:51:15 UTC] damienelmaskador: I saw the Decision Game too I love the 999 games... I knew the 999 games before the Danganrompa
[2017-06-28 23:51:15 UTC] vlayer: The bad ends are so good though
[2017-06-28 23:51:16 UTC] kodakcam: really
[2017-06-28 23:51:18 UTC] powerpuffgirl12134: again
[2017-06-28 23:51:24 UTC] pcgamehunter: Fan service is shit DansGame
[2017-06-28 23:51:27 UTC] damienelmaskador: more gameplay and mindfucking story
[2017-06-28 23:51:31 UTC] kodakcam: smh
[2017-06-28 23:51:32 UTC] midnight_strike_force: Huh, just looked it up, UDG on PS4 came out in Europe first. For US it came out on Tuesday.
[2017-06-28 23:51:34 UTC] endlessnine99: Yeah, but there's too few of them for how many different permutations there are.
[2017-06-28 23:51:38 UTC] kodakcam: lmao
[2017-06-28 23:51:38 UTC] pcgamehunter: Some bored dude in a basement can do fan service than you SwiftRage
[2017-06-28 23:51:44 UTC] pcgamehunter: better*
[2017-06-28 23:51:46 UTC] thegreatempathizer: saved forever
[2017-06-28 23:51:49 UTC] midnight_strike_force: I think the FPS will be a bit improved on PS4 at least.
[2017-06-28 23:51:55 UTC] vlayer: Axe ending in 999 made me turn on the lights
[2017-06-28 23:51:57 UTC] dukaduka: somehow this fanservice moment is going to be a key piece of evidence NotLikeThis of course
[2017-06-28 23:51:59 UTC] endlessnine99: Also the protagonist is literally an idiot.
[2017-06-28 23:52:01 UTC] endlessnine99: Jumpe.
[2017-06-28 23:52:07 UTC] freshtilldeath56: Music Kreygasm
[2017-06-28 23:52:10 UTC] endlessnine99: Or whatever.
[2017-06-28 23:52:15 UTC] pcgamehunter: @dukaduka uh-hu OpieOP
[2017-06-28 23:52:27 UTC] pcgamehunter: Trumpet is the killer! Kreygasm
[2017-06-28 23:52:41 UTC] endlessnine99: "Oh boy it's the my childhood sweethearts corpse, I better go hug it!"
[2017-06-28 23:52:43 UTC] thegreatempathizer: Shit!
[2017-06-28 23:52:53 UTC] lucifrend: nagito's hair is a disaster
[2017-06-28 23:53:06 UTC] damienelmaskador: Never got the Axe ending... I had the sarcophagus ending first and I was like... hey it cant end like this!
[2017-06-28 23:53:10 UTC] pcgamehunter: So it's accurate to his character OpieOP
[2017-06-28 23:53:11 UTC] dukaduka: i'm still trying to figure out how Kyakuya got under the table 🤔 gonna have to put on my thinking cap
[2017-06-28 23:53:17 UTC] crocodile090: and that ladies and gents, is the mood swing
[2017-06-28 23:53:18 UTC] endlessnine99: You got the sarcophagus ending first?
[2017-06-28 23:53:19 UTC] midnight_strike_force: You can tell Nagito is powerful because he has white hair Kappa
[2017-06-28 23:53:21 UTC] endlessnine99: Bad luck
[2017-06-28 23:53:35 UTC] yaslothy: got it?
[2017-06-28 23:53:42 UTC] pcgamehunter: He has emergency wheels attached to his chest Kappa @dukaduka
[2017-06-28 23:53:45 UTC] yaslothy: women > men
[2017-06-28 23:53:47 UTC] yaslothy: wait wut
[2017-06-28 23:53:50 UTC] pcgamehunter: For when he slips Kappa
[2017-06-28 23:53:54 UTC] deep_drive: WRONG slothy
[2017-06-28 23:54:05 UTC] pcgamehunter: Cherdy secretly a woman Kappa
[2017-06-28 23:54:05 UTC] dukaduka: Feminist huh HotPokket
[2017-06-28 23:54:06 UTC] yaslothy: PogChamp
[2017-06-28 23:54:09 UTC] endlessnine99: I got the axe ending first, cursing Junpei's stupidity.
[2017-06-28 23:54:10 UTC] midnight_strike_force: Ow.
[2017-06-28 23:54:12 UTC] damienelmaskador: Well I bump into the sarcophagus and I was pissed cause back then I thought there was only one ending
[2017-06-28 23:54:12 UTC] proxycon: dogs are the better humans
[2017-06-28 23:54:20 UTC] drowsylouis: byakuya was starting to grown on me, then he just dies. FeelsBadMan
[2017-06-28 23:54:35 UTC] endlessnine99: Watching snake in the safe ending is super satisfying, and the music is on point.
[2017-06-28 23:54:53 UTC] endlessnine99: It's the better of the two uses of Morphogenic Sorrow.
[2017-06-28 23:54:59 UTC] damienelmaskador: then I got the knife and then another I forgot which but I realize I had to redo the sarcophagus ending AGAIN!
[2017-06-28 23:55:18 UTC] crocodile090: yea he did " grow " on us alright
[2017-06-28 23:55:21 UTC] endlessnine99: I had to refer to a guide.
[2017-06-28 23:55:28 UTC] midnight_strike_force: lidurully
[2017-06-28 23:55:32 UTC] yaslothy: cahlm down woman DansGame
[2017-06-28 23:55:41 UTC] endlessnine99: One repeated ending is too many for me.
[2017-06-28 23:55:41 UTC] yaslothy: i dont understand DansGame
[2017-06-28 23:55:43 UTC] jelsea1973: Hmm as fat as Byakuya is who is probably the only one that could carry him and place him under the table.
[2017-06-28 23:55:44 UTC] yaslothy: im a man DansGame
[2017-06-28 23:55:52 UTC] pcgamehunter: Of course not cherdy you're just a dumb blond Kappa
[2017-06-28 23:56:07 UTC] yaslothy: ShadyLulu
[2017-06-28 23:56:08 UTC] geckyy: Morphogenetic Sorrow plays a few more times in the Nonary Games edition of 999
[2017-06-28 23:56:10 UTC] thegreatempathizer: hell hounds wear earrings?
[2017-06-28 23:56:14 UTC] sanguinenite: I had the safe ending on my 2nd try xD
[2017-06-28 23:56:21 UTC] endlessnine99: In what scenes?
[2017-06-28 23:56:22 UTC] vlayer: The visual novel where I had to use a guide was for Steins;Gate, like what the fuck was that to get the true ending NotLikeThis
[2017-06-28 23:56:24 UTC] pcgamehunter: Didn't even put up resistance WutFace
[2017-06-28 23:56:25 UTC] wasabiphobic: LUL
[2017-06-28 23:56:27 UTC] dukaduka: Gundham LUL
[2017-06-28 23:56:33 UTC] thirdeyethethird: riveting narration is still ongoing I see
[2017-06-28 23:56:35 UTC] pcgamehunter: IKR @Vlayer
[2017-06-28 23:56:35 UTC] sanguinenite: The game 999 doors something like that
[2017-06-28 23:56:36 UTC] wasabiphobic: Gundham <3
[2017-06-28 23:56:47 UTC] geckyy: Think it plays when Santa tells the story of the two santas in the...steam engine room?
[2017-06-28 23:56:50 UTC] endlessnine99: Oh
[2017-06-28 23:56:51 UTC] kinggoken: dsp going to go over time?
[2017-06-28 23:56:55 UTC] endlessnine99: That would make sense.
[2017-06-28 23:57:04 UTC] pcgamehunter: I literally didn't know I could change the text response the first playthrough MingLee @Vlayer
[2017-06-28 23:57:09 UTC] endlessnine99: Both variations of the scene?
[2017-06-28 23:57:34 UTC] geckyy: Not sure, I'm in the middle of playing it myself. Only got knife ending so far
[2017-06-28 23:57:46 UTC] jelsea1973: Im calling it now the Hamsters did it
[2017-06-28 23:58:01 UTC] pcgamehunter: They control monokuma Kappa
[2017-06-28 23:58:03 UTC] vlayer: The hamsters did it with the help of Hajime's pet
[2017-06-28 23:58:11 UTC] endlessnine99: The guide online told me that I had to be an idiot in the first two choices to unlock a different ending, which is patently false.
[2017-06-28 23:58:11 UTC] wasabiphobic: @jelsea1973, you mean the 4 dark devs of destruction!
[2017-06-28 23:58:14 UTC] pcgamehunter: Who's that ? Mikan or Nagito MingLee
[2017-06-28 23:58:16 UTC] jelsea1973: yep
[2017-06-28 23:58:21 UTC] midnight_strike_force: Animals are the real monsters.
[2017-06-28 23:58:22 UTC] thegreatempathizer: no wrench
[2017-06-28 23:58:30 UTC] endlessnine99: You don't have to make snake think you are retarded.
[2017-06-28 23:59:05 UTC] pcgamehunter: Any dragon dildo's inside Kappa
[2017-06-28 23:59:06 UTC] sirboneyard: phil are you ever gonna do another cooking w the king?
[2017-06-28 23:59:13 UTC] endlessnine99: Phil isn't reading chat
[2017-06-28 23:59:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: I'm sure byakuya could use those Keepo
[2017-06-28 23:59:34 UTC] vlayer: The worst part about 999 was how slow it was to do replays and getting through already read text, even with the fastforwarding. VLR handled that a lot better
[2017-06-28 23:59:51 UTC] thegreatempathizer: camera. :F
[2017-06-28 23:59:55 UTC] yaslothy: WOAH
[2017-06-28 23:59:56 UTC] endlessnine99: Oh yeah, and didn't the PC version add a bonus bad end?
[2017-06-28 23:59:58 UTC] kinggoken: lol again
