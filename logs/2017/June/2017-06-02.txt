[2017-06-02 01:52:44 UTC] airhead793d2jsp: pecker
[2017-06-02 02:02:11 UTC] ughhhj: Hopefully Phil isn't watching
[2017-06-02 02:02:42 UTC] darksydephil: well i'm not a retard, so no, i'm not watching
[2017-06-02 02:03:20 UTC] ughhhj: Good on you phil, are you starting another stream soon?
[2017-06-02 02:04:14 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm watching a spelling bee on ESPN Kappa

[2017-06-02 02:08:45 UTC] octoppedree: sup dood
[2017-06-02 02:09:00 UTC] ughhhj: Anyone else getting a lot of whispers?
[2017-06-02 02:09:13 UTC] auzziesly47adam: friday is tekken 7 in the usa
[2017-06-02 02:09:59 UTC] darksydephil: just block any annoying whisperers, i heard a few peopel complaining of it recently
[2017-06-02 02:10:18 UTC] paysus: lol this art is beautiful
[2017-06-02 02:10:24 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, I've been told repeatedly to go jerk off to sonic porn in whispers as an example brownLUL
[2017-06-02 02:10:35 UTC] ughhhj: Ahahahah
[2017-06-02 02:10:38 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: I don't think it will be as bad tonight. They are doing their podcast thing right now.
[2017-06-02 02:10:45 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: So shouldn't be too many trolls here.
[2017-06-02 02:10:51 UTC] delta_assault1: Man, those ppl are sad.
[2017-06-02 02:11:00 UTC] blue_blur64: Was the first stream bad?
[2017-06-02 02:11:03 UTC] mora3000: !uptime
[2017-06-02 02:11:08 UTC] ughhhj: Not really
[2017-06-02 02:11:12 UTC] darksydephil: there was trolling yeah, but nothing out of hand
[2017-06-02 02:11:15 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: @blue_blur64 just a lot of people whispering people
[2017-06-02 02:11:26 UTC] darksydephil: honestly kind of the same par of what we get normally but of course it was about Leanna
[2017-06-02 02:11:26 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: dumb things
[2017-06-02 02:11:30 UTC] ughhhj: But this is an online game soooo...
[2017-06-02 02:11:32 UTC] blue_blur64: Ah
[2017-06-02 02:11:39 UTC] sanguinenite: yeah was it bad after I left, it was pretty usual of the trolls if you ask me
[2017-06-02 02:11:40 UTC] bobobocn4: Does playing watching archive streams on twitch help you? Do you get ad sense for that?
[2017-06-02 02:11:44 UTC] delta_assault1: Devoting their lives to tearing down a great guy like Phil. Even though he was completely right about the MGS games.
[2017-06-02 02:11:52 UTC] darksydephil: btw i think those bots are gone. didnt notice a single one today
[2017-06-02 02:12:05 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Shouldn't be as bad this stream though, they are all preoccupied
[2017-06-02 02:12:38 UTC] sanguinenite: I dont think we care all that much
[2017-06-02 02:12:42 UTC] ughhhj: That's good at least, I wonder why the bots showed up
[2017-06-02 02:12:43 UTC] darksydephil: is the stream working?
[2017-06-02 02:12:44 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Do bots even effect anything?
[2017-06-02 02:12:49 UTC] sanguinenite: typ
[2017-06-02 02:12:53 UTC] eliskor: yup it works
[2017-06-02 02:12:54 UTC] octoppedree: looks like it's working
[2017-06-02 02:12:54 UTC] blue_blur64: yeah, it's working
[2017-06-02 02:12:55 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Yes
[2017-06-02 02:12:56 UTC] delta_assault1: It works
[2017-06-02 02:12:56 UTC] sanguinenite: yup
[2017-06-02 02:12:57 UTC] roubador: yes
[2017-06-02 02:12:58 UTC] katexo234: yup

[2017-06-02 02:13:03 UTC] methr0llins: yes
[2017-06-02 02:13:06 UTC] paysus: Wait, bots? What kind of bots, thats bizarre
[2017-06-02 02:13:07 UTC] blue_blur64: brownHEY @NeoSpartanHesperos9

[2017-06-02 02:13:33 UTC] rx93gundamm: phillip~
[2017-06-02 02:13:37 UTC] takumibun: who uses a water mug now a days
[2017-06-02 02:13:39 UTC] delta_assault1: I was kinda confused by that last episode of The Walking Dead last night. Shit didn't make any sense with people
[2017-06-02 02:13:55 UTC] delta_assault1: People changing personalities and motivations from scene to scene
[2017-06-02 02:14:06 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: CoolStoryBob
[2017-06-02 02:14:07 UTC] weakmanarms: hi
[2017-06-02 02:14:18 UTC] thadoril: wheres the chat??
[2017-06-02 02:14:20 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: I thought the walking dead episde was 10/10
[2017-06-02 02:14:21 UTC] ughhhj: I always wonder if phil get a lets endure going of them ahah
[2017-06-02 02:14:22 UTC] blue_blur64: What's wrong with that Delta? It keeps you on your toes Kappa
[2017-06-02 02:14:22 UTC] poopmano: hey
[2017-06-02 02:14:29 UTC] sanguinenite: I just realised something - the trolls use a viewbot earlier today just to pretend that a lotta people came by just to see phil trolled about you know what.
[2017-06-02 02:14:44 UTC] kondekka: Yeah
[2017-06-02 02:14:57 UTC] weakmanarms: A sock in a box is talking about Phil right now
[2017-06-02 02:15:00 UTC] poopmano: will you be playing tekken?
[2017-06-02 02:15:10 UTC] ughhhj: Is it supposed to be that forbidden to say?
[2017-06-02 02:15:13 UTC] blue_blur64: What kind of box? Kappa
[2017-06-02 02:15:14 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: It didn't seem like a viewbot, you can tell when there is a giant spike or drop of viewers, there was such a movement during the first stream
[2017-06-02 02:15:15 UTC] paysus: @POOPMANO I think he said he will when it comes out
[2017-06-02 02:15:21 UTC] thadoril: chat working now nice
[2017-06-02 02:15:24 UTC] poopmano: cool I can't wait.
[2017-06-02 02:15:29 UTC] darksydephil: ok water time
[2017-06-02 02:15:40 UTC] octoppedree: choo choo
[2017-06-02 02:15:44 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: What characters are you going to play phil?
[2017-06-02 02:15:50 UTC] rnrs: sup
[2017-06-02 02:16:01 UTC] ughhhj: What's funny is they claimed that the reason they are talking about it is because you talked about it on the prestream instead of just the twitlonger
[2017-06-02 02:16:08 UTC] delta_assault1: @blue_blur64 Just felt schizophrenic. One moment, Elaine hates you, the next she doesn't. One moment, Gabe's pissed at you for killing Joan, the next... he's thinking you're the ideal father figure. Just veered all over the place.
[2017-06-02 02:16:09 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Phil BTW we can see your camera
[2017-06-02 02:16:09 UTC] poopmano: I would like to see phil play as red hood in injustice 2
[2017-06-02 02:16:09 UTC] bobobocn4: Does anyone know if watching past broadcasts counts towards ad revenue? I don't want to watch past broadcasts and not have Phil be compensated for it.
[2017-06-02 02:16:25 UTC] weakmanarms: A certain streaming group on smashcast is talking about Phil joining the lonely hearts club ;)
[2017-06-02 02:16:27 UTC] kondekka: Does one lose it's subscriber badge, if you don't pay for another month? I don√§t know how these things work..
[2017-06-02 02:16:28 UTC] paysus: Oh yeah we can see his camera a little bit on the left side
[2017-06-02 02:16:39 UTC] blue_blur64: I honestly don't know bobobo
[2017-06-02 02:16:58 UTC] sanguinenite: I bet they are going to try to say on their own you-know-what to pretend to be bigger an army than they actually are. This is like what a gangster mob would do to try to intimidate and dissuade competition. They really want Phil off youtube/twitch.
[2017-06-02 02:16:59 UTC] poopmano: we can see you phil
[2017-06-02 02:17:18 UTC] blue_blur64: You have to resubscribe within 30 days (at least with Twitch Prime) to keep the sub badge
[2017-06-02 02:17:25 UTC] katexo234: good evening everyone
[2017-06-02 02:17:25 UTC] delta_assault1: @Bobobocn4 The previous broadcasts get taken down after a couple days, so I just stick to watching the youtube videos
[2017-06-02 02:17:30 UTC] blue_blur64: Otherwise you start over
[2017-06-02 02:17:38 UTC] kondekka: Alright
[2017-06-02 02:17:43 UTC] pixelbane: Phil did you see that some detractor is making a Quake 3 mod using your quotes and images. It is utterly disgusting.
[2017-06-02 02:17:45 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: @DarksydePhil we can see your camera phil!
[2017-06-02 02:17:47 UTC] ughhhj: @sanguinenite just let them do it, they already have a dumb reason as to why they are even talking about it
[2017-06-02 02:17:51 UTC] delta_assault1: @sanguinenite And all this over his playthroughs of MGS games? Feels excessive
[2017-06-02 02:18:06 UTC] manyperegrine81: Sup everyone
[2017-06-02 02:18:06 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Whew, avoided another incident
[2017-06-02 02:18:13 UTC] weakmanarms: DSP, the SOK are talking about your little breakup! DSP, the SOK are talking about your little breakup!
[2017-06-02 02:18:15 UTC] psychicfriendfredbear1210: Hey. Uh...what happened between you and Leanna
[2017-06-02 02:18:20 UTC] poopmano: glad we avoided another incident
[2017-06-02 02:18:23 UTC] sanguinenite: I know I was just rationalising why they would use viewbots in the first place
[2017-06-02 02:18:24 UTC] thadoril: phil you doing more Friday the 13th i know its super buggy and broken but its fun to watch
[2017-06-02 02:18:26 UTC] manyperegrine81: Everyone having a good night
[2017-06-02 02:18:27 UTC] misspoop: lol
[2017-06-02 02:18:31 UTC] delta_assault1: I actually really enjoyed his playthroughs of MGS 1,2,3
[2017-06-02 02:18:31 UTC] blue_blur64: @Weakmanarms We don't care! @Weakmanarms We don't care!
[2017-06-02 02:18:33 UTC] blue_blur64: Kappa
[2017-06-02 02:18:35 UTC] bwt56: It's been a while since I've been here due to work how's everyone been?
[2017-06-02 02:18:36 UTC] embiidttp: these detractors are truly disgusting humans
[2017-06-02 02:18:40 UTC] pixelbane: Phil did you see that some detractor is making a Quake 3 mod using your quotes and images. It is utterly disgusting. :(
[2017-06-02 02:18:51 UTC] psychicfriendfredbear1210: Fuck these detractors
[2017-06-02 02:18:54 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Phillip what characters are you planning on playing?
[2017-06-02 02:18:55 UTC] pray4rock: Tekken & Injustice hype, great year for fighters
[2017-06-02 02:19:14 UTC] paysus: Detractors?
[2017-06-02 02:19:19 UTC] poopmano: eff these detractors hope you are doing well philly boy.
[2017-06-02 02:19:23 UTC] delta_assault1: Glad to see Phil's holding up so well. Heart of a lion.
[2017-06-02 02:19:25 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Are you hyped for Tekken 7?
[2017-06-02 02:19:44 UTC] misspoop: tekken hype! woooooo
[2017-06-02 02:19:46 UTC] bentboxer: im hyped for star trek
[2017-06-02 02:19:48 UTC] bentboxer: !
[2017-06-02 02:19:52 UTC] gottisttot1: Hey phil are we going to get some long 12 hour streams now like back in Connecticut days but streaming instead of just posting videos
[2017-06-02 02:19:53 UTC] ughhhj: Still getting more whispers, all they tell me is that they say how phil saw the whole thing as a problem because of the way he worded it earlier
[2017-06-02 02:19:57 UTC] clasicobic: wanted to hear about the cucking
[2017-06-02 02:20:01 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Star Trek is really a fun time.
[2017-06-02 02:20:06 UTC] psychicfriendfredbear1210: Hey. What happened between you and Leanna?
[2017-06-02 02:20:14 UTC] bowserchomp91: hi
[2017-06-02 02:20:20 UTC] kushuluck: @psychicfriendfredbear1210 go to his twitter
[2017-06-02 02:20:25 UTC] gottisttot1: @ughhhj what whispers
[2017-06-02 02:20:25 UTC] bobobocn4: It been a long time since I watched a stream live. Haha
[2017-06-02 02:20:26 UTC] pray4rock: Let's get that movie Wonder Woman gear from the multiverse phil
[2017-06-02 02:20:29 UTC] delta_assault1: Star Trek should be alright, but without three other real people doing it beside him, it seems like it won't be great.
[2017-06-02 02:20:30 UTC] bowserchomp91: Phil, we need to know about your breakup!
[2017-06-02 02:20:34 UTC] poopmano: philly boy you hyped for tekken?
[2017-06-02 02:20:35 UTC] jl_volken: Phil is in range. Activate detractor beam.
[2017-06-02 02:20:36 UTC] sanguinenite: turn off the settings whispers
[2017-06-02 02:20:47 UTC] embiidttp: ignore the haters
[2017-06-02 02:20:53 UTC] paysus: @POOPMANO Well he just said hes gonna play it all weekend lol
[2017-06-02 02:20:59 UTC] ughhhj: It doesn't bother me it's just random
[2017-06-02 02:21:12 UTC] bentboxer: why is tekken being released so close to injustice 2
[2017-06-02 02:21:17 UTC] poopmano: I can't wait I am hyped. He's playing on the PS4 platform?
[2017-06-02 02:21:19 UTC] embiidttp: #positive
[2017-06-02 02:21:24 UTC] pixelbane: @DarksydePhil I agree, it is super annoying. Have you seen the shitty mod of Quake 3 a detractor posing as you is making?
[2017-06-02 02:21:30 UTC] misspoop: tekken is officially out in Australia. I am sacrificing my Tekken time to watch this!
[2017-06-02 02:21:30 UTC] x1xnoblex1x: Hi @DarksydePhil
[2017-06-02 02:21:40 UTC] captainmarvelous17: Oh this oughtta be rich
[2017-06-02 02:21:50 UTC] gottisttot1: @ughhhj what are they saying
[2017-06-02 02:21:52 UTC] embiidttp: different type of fighter
[2017-06-02 02:21:55 UTC] embiidttp: 2d or 3d
[2017-06-02 02:21:57 UTC] focusdakid: Tekken always sells
[2017-06-02 02:21:58 UTC] gottisttot1: They need to stop
[2017-06-02 02:22:02 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: To be fair there is not much overlap between them, there so different

[2017-06-02 02:22:23 UTC] thadoril: detractors are the biggest loser that have ever walked the earth they need to move on with the pathetic lives
[2017-06-02 02:22:23 UTC] tha_lol_guy: lo
[2017-06-02 02:22:26 UTC] delta_assault1: Tekken doesn't seem like it'll do as well. No big DC characters.
[2017-06-02 02:22:28 UTC] poopmano: I don't think that gae on the nintendo switch will sell that well
[2017-06-02 02:22:29 UTC] ughhhj: @gottisttot1 that they are only talking about it because phil decided to say something past twitlonger
[2017-06-02 02:22:38 UTC] sanguinenite: I can get a free Switch but I am not getting it because it it is another wii u
[2017-06-02 02:22:44 UTC] big_meatyclaw: SabaPing
[2017-06-02 02:22:47 UTC] wjr02003: You can completely block and even report whispers. If on mobile click on the person harassing you then click the gear and hit block. If on PC you can report the whisper and it will automatically block them
[2017-06-02 02:22:59 UTC] daddi_boi: @sanguinenite that is so insanely dumb
[2017-06-02 02:23:04 UTC] bwt56: What characters you plan on using tonight?
[2017-06-02 02:23:08 UTC] katexo234: people playing tekken early
[2017-06-02 02:23:11 UTC] bentboxer: phil already has higher viewership than justin wong
[2017-06-02 02:23:12 UTC] poopmano: Idk tekken is a big franchise but then we have the release of WW so injustice 2 might do better?
[2017-06-02 02:23:19 UTC] thadoril: phil you ever going to play Friday the 13th again despite the bugs and bad servers it very fun to watch
[2017-06-02 02:23:22 UTC] lucifrend: it sold 1/4th of what SF V sold in Japan at launch week
[2017-06-02 02:23:25 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Imagine if your a new viewer of phil, you get hateful messages from people. Jesus
[2017-06-02 02:23:34 UTC] gottisttot1: Alex Valle was playing it and said USF2 won't be some big thing
[2017-06-02 02:23:35 UTC] blue_blur64: Well, I'm looking at a couple of articles, but Street Fighter 2 made it into the UK top 10

[2017-06-02 02:24:10 UTC] superbatcat: Hey chat and phil
[2017-06-02 02:24:14 UTC] blue_blur64: And in Japan it so far sold about 16.5 k
[2017-06-02 02:24:15 UTC] kondekka: So is the subscriber badge permanent or is it only for 1 month and then carried on if you keep youself as an subscriber?

[2017-06-02 02:24:38 UTC] delta_assault1: Phil, any inkling on what characters you'll use tonight?
[2017-06-02 02:24:38 UTC] rnrs: nintendo switch online service $20 a year
[2017-06-02 02:24:43 UTC] rnrs: awesome

[2017-06-02 02:25:01 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, that's a very reasonable price, I can get down with that

[2017-06-02 21:29:47 UTC] midnight_strike_force: @HuntingSwan I assume that the English voice actor was living in Japan when he did this, so the directors (presumably Japanese) probably couldn't tell what bad English acting is.
