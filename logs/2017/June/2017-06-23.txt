[2017-06-23 00:01:06 UTC] betheallen: tsk
[2017-06-23 00:01:08 UTC] qu33nofredlions: HeyGuys HeyGuys HeyGuys
[2017-06-23 00:01:41 UTC] virtualradiver: Well I suppose watching a LG commercial on a LG telivision is a bit bullshit but ok
[2017-06-23 00:02:58 UTC] ivantheczar: sup guys
[2017-06-23 00:03:09 UTC] virtualradiver: phil's stream just ended
[2017-06-23 00:03:14 UTC] virtualradiver: that is what is up
[2017-06-23 00:03:19 UTC] ivantheczar: oh
[2017-06-23 00:03:58 UTC] elijah_baldwin: stream over for the day?
[2017-06-23 00:04:10 UTC] virtualradiver: I think he said there would be acouple of hour later
[2017-06-23 00:04:21 UTC] virtualradiver: if I didn't missunderstand it
[2017-06-23 00:04:48 UTC] nolbert87: he said he's coming back in about 2 hours
[2017-06-23 00:04:52 UTC] virtualradiver: nice
[2017-06-23 00:38:13 UTC] mindofatrainedseal: when's the next sesh
[2017-06-23 01:09:58 UTC] blue_blur64: SwiftRage
[2017-06-23 01:52:12 UTC] flugsaft: how long until it begins? how many minutes?
[2017-06-23 01:52:57 UTC] blue_blur64: Like 30 minutes or so, but I'm honestly expecting it to take long because of Atlus
[2017-06-23 01:53:36 UTC] flugsaft: ok thank you.
[2017-06-23 01:53:51 UTC] dspfandood: aatttlluuussss SwiftRage
[2017-06-23 01:54:21 UTC] dspfandood: how dare you do this to phil SwiftRage
[2017-06-23 01:55:20 UTC] taurusoxford: Phil's 2017 GOTY awards are gonna be the weirdest thing - he never finished Nier Automata and obviously won't bother with P5 - the two top contenders
[2017-06-23 01:55:27 UTC] blue_blur64: The copyright strike just doesn't make sense. Why those specific videos? Why now? Why not do this to all the channels that have posted every boss fight in the game and every story event? This only happened to Phil
[2017-06-23 01:56:27 UTC] dspfandood: well they said you cant show boss fights and important story bits
[2017-06-23 01:56:56 UTC] blue_blur64: Yes, and there's plenty of channels that have done just that
[2017-06-23 01:57:56 UTC] dspfandood: who knows maybe they saw he was on his 300th part and were like damn shut that shit down
[2017-06-23 01:58:12 UTC] dspfandood: he must be in endgame
[2017-06-23 01:58:36 UTC] blue_blur64: Ok, but why persona fusion videos? Why not an actual story segment? That'd at least make a little sense despite the ingame date always being on the screen
[2017-06-23 02:00:11 UTC] blue_blur64: You'd have to not look at the video title, 5 seconds of the video to see the in-game date
[2017-06-23 02:00:32 UTC] dspfandood: maybe they didnt care as to what video is actually striked down as long as you violate
[2017-06-23 02:00:43 UTC] bloodhungrykitten: so uh, i wont go into spoilers, but if he dos DR2 this stream, chapters and trials can be considrebly longer then the first game, you guys may want to encourage him to be prepared for those things.
[2017-06-23 02:01:15 UTC] gwentandchill: VaultBoy TBTacoProps
[2017-06-23 02:01:16 UTC] blue_blur64: But because of their restriction update, Phil hasn't actually violated anything
[2017-06-23 02:01:16 UTC] dspfandood: they aint THAT much longer
[2017-06-23 02:01:51 UTC] dspfandood: yah but like i said the deadline wasnt the only guidline they listed
[2017-06-23 02:02:12 UTC] dspfandood: they had like 5 bullets of stuff you cant do
[2017-06-23 02:02:26 UTC] blue_blur64: Like, even before the update, they could've filed the strike on any of the party members' awakening scenes
[2017-06-23 02:02:59 UTC] blue_blur64: Why didn't they do it then when, according to Phil, Atlus was being spam tweeted about violating the restrictions?
[2017-06-23 02:04:00 UTC] dspfandood: maybe they didnt want to go ban crazy so close to launch
[2017-06-23 02:04:28 UTC] blue_blur64: But they posted the restrictions like a day before the game launched. That makes no sense
[2017-06-23 02:05:25 UTC] blue_blur64: Even then, they've barely done any banning from what I've heard. Like a few twitch channels suspended back in April and that's about it
[2017-06-23 02:05:55 UTC] blue_blur64: It's just so random that it doesn't really make sense to me
[2017-06-23 02:06:22 UTC] dspfandood: who knows but that atlus usa channel commented on phils p3 pt so they seem aware of him
[2017-06-23 02:06:40 UTC] dspfandood: detractor works there
[2017-06-23 02:07:09 UTC] zeronaire: it was probably automated.
[2017-06-23 02:07:19 UTC] blue_blur64: Unless, if this was the video I'm thinking of, that having Yamato-no-Orochi on the screen is considered past the restriction date since you can't fuse it in your first run until past that date (unless you grind early on)
[2017-06-23 02:07:52 UTC] yaslothy: atlus lel ultimate trolls
[2017-06-23 02:07:53 UTC] blue_blur64: Do auto copyright strikes exist? I thought that only happened with Content ID.
[2017-06-23 02:08:16 UTC] gwentandchill: its all automated
[2017-06-23 02:08:36 UTC] dspfandood: i dont think they care about personas. they just decided to fuck phil over and copyrighted some random videos and called it a day
[2017-06-23 02:08:52 UTC] dspfandood: i dont think it was automatec
[2017-06-23 02:09:09 UTC] blue_blur64: Well if they did do it just to fuck with Phil, then that's very petty of them.
[2017-06-23 02:09:55 UTC] zeronaire: That doesn't make sense. Why just 2? If they really want to shaft him why not all of them?
[2017-06-23 02:10:16 UTC] dspfandood: you only need 1 for a strike
[2017-06-23 02:10:36 UTC] elcrimsonking: ouch
[2017-06-23 02:10:36 UTC] zeronaire: Takedown notices.
[2017-06-23 02:10:41 UTC] dspfandood: 2 for good measure. doubble tap
[2017-06-23 02:10:56 UTC] yaslothy: Sons of Atlus
[2017-06-23 02:10:58 UTC] blue_blur64: But remember the fanart fiasco fandood? The guy filed copyright strikes for every video that had the art he made in them
[2017-06-23 02:11:01 UTC] yaslothy: TriHard
[2017-06-23 02:11:22 UTC] blue_blur64: So if Atlus really wanted to fuck with Phil, they should've done it to all of his vids
[2017-06-23 02:11:26 UTC] gwentandchill: getting 1 copyright strike can stop you from monentization
[2017-06-23 02:11:34 UTC] virtualradiver: are there any similar cases with streamers having similar takedowns to phil?
[2017-06-23 02:11:59 UTC] dspfandood: yah but when i mean fuck with him im just sayin in terms of shutting down the pt
[2017-06-23 02:12:03 UTC] blue_blur64: I've barely heard anything virtual, not since the restrictions were lessened at the end of April
[2017-06-23 02:12:08 UTC] dspfandood: not in a detractor way
[2017-06-23 02:12:50 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Hey there
[2017-06-23 02:13:00 UTC] zeronaire: There'd be more effective ways than just striking/takedown noticing 2 random videos.
[2017-06-23 02:13:03 UTC] yaslothy: Will phil lose views if he puts the pt in private?
[2017-06-23 02:13:05 UTC] yaslothy: Hey delta
[2017-06-23 02:13:06 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: I heard about the news
[2017-06-23 02:13:11 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Poor phil
[2017-06-23 02:13:18 UTC] yaslothy: lol
[2017-06-23 02:13:22 UTC] dspfandood: only if he deletes it
[2017-06-23 02:13:26 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: I guess u could say that
[2017-06-23 02:13:35 UTC] blue_blur64: I honestly do just hope that it's another Splinter Cell situation
[2017-06-23 02:13:37 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: He never saw that coming
[2017-06-23 02:13:43 UTC] ericeericson: ^
[2017-06-23 02:13:47 UTC] virtualradiver: splinter cell situation?
[2017-06-23 02:14:01 UTC] blue_blur64: I think that was the game back on his old channel
[2017-06-23 02:14:01 UTC] nolbert87: what happened?
[2017-06-23 02:14:09 UTC] yaslothy: So his p3 and p5 pts were basically wastes of time
[2017-06-23 02:14:15 UTC] taurusoxford: Atlus gave Phil his "Last Surprise"
[2017-06-23 02:14:18 UTC] blue_blur64: nolbert, basically rip any Atlus playthroughs
[2017-06-23 02:14:21 UTC] burnout26: copyright strike
[2017-06-23 02:14:29 UTC] zeronaire: @TaurusOxford Life will change.
[2017-06-23 02:14:31 UTC] blue_blur64: No more Persona 5 or any atlus game
[2017-06-23 02:14:37 UTC] burnout26: Sega owns Atlus
[2017-06-23 02:14:48 UTC] lookatmyjoker: You never see it coming
[2017-06-23 02:14:50 UTC] taurusoxford: @Zeronaire Atlus are truly Blooming Villians
[2017-06-23 02:14:51 UTC] yaslothy: Bethe will be delighted. BigBrother
[2017-06-23 02:14:52 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Yup@TaurusOxford
[2017-06-23 02:14:53 UTC] nolbert87: really why now?
[2017-06-23 02:15:09 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, but Sega barely has anything to do with Atlus
[2017-06-23 02:15:25 UTC] yaslothy: Don't they own them?
[2017-06-23 02:15:29 UTC] zeronaire: TaurusOxford will Atlus expose who they are beneath the mask?
[2017-06-23 02:15:33 UTC] blue_blur64: Like, think of Atlus like the Pokemon Company. They do what they want
[2017-06-23 02:15:34 UTC] dspfandood: bethe prolly told atlus themselves
[2017-06-23 02:15:49 UTC] taurusoxford: @Zeronaire ....fuck, i'm out of song names
[2017-06-23 02:15:52 UTC] taurusoxford: :(
[2017-06-23 02:15:58 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Maybe atlus did that cuz phil rage quitted p3 and call them assholes for the date thing in p5
[2017-06-23 02:16:00 UTC] yaslothy: Wow bethe to what extent do you dislike persona?
[2017-06-23 02:16:06 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Who knows
[2017-06-23 02:16:17 UTC] blue_blur64: Well that would be an unjustified reason
[2017-06-23 02:16:21 UTC] zeronaire: @TaurusOxford Well they had to get up, get out there.
[2017-06-23 02:16:30 UTC] gwentandchill: Copyright holders can do what they want
[2017-06-23 02:16:30 UTC] elcrimsonking: atlus caught wind of that?
[2017-06-23 02:16:34 UTC] blue_blur64: And it would be an abuse of Youtube's system (even if it's a bad system) :P
[2017-06-23 02:16:44 UTC] yaslothy: Charm salt @elcrimsonking
[2017-06-23 02:16:54 UTC] dspfandood: maybe atlus saw phil yell at me today on stream and took matters into their own hands SeemsGood
[2017-06-23 02:17:02 UTC] yaslothy: LUL
[2017-06-23 02:17:25 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: I guess also you could say
[2017-06-23 02:17:49 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Atlus: The charm salt is real.
[2017-06-23 02:18:00 UTC] virtualradiver: they comment and support trolls and copyrightstrike him. There is simething wrong with this picure
[2017-06-23 02:18:27 UTC] taurusoxford: @TheNewFaceofCreation Atlus was just doing Phil a favour and preventing another Persona ragequit. :P
[2017-06-23 02:18:31 UTC] lookatmyjoker: It's almost if he plays games to have fun.
[2017-06-23 02:19:03 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Good reason @TaurusOxford
[2017-06-23 02:19:09 UTC] dspfandood: whatever more time for danganronpa 2 if he ever stops being sick SeemsGood
[2017-06-23 02:19:13 UTC] yaslothy: The word for today is: FUN
[2017-06-23 02:19:20 UTC] yaslothy: F-U-N
[2017-06-23 02:19:41 UTC] noobrydar: :)
[2017-06-23 02:20:03 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Why u happy
[2017-06-23 02:20:14 UTC] paradogred: The plot is about to screw with corrupted system right? Look at them go now...
[2017-06-23 02:20:23 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Phil is bleeding money dood
[2017-06-23 02:20:42 UTC] noobrydar: where is DSP?
[2017-06-23 02:20:52 UTC] elcrimsonking: the list of games he can play gets smaller and smaller every year it seems
[2017-06-23 02:21:04 UTC] mxtt10589: @YaSlothy F is for fire that burns down the whole town!U is for uranium... bombs!N is for no survivors
[2017-06-23 02:21:06 UTC] bloodbornenow: is he on tonight still? for RD
[2017-06-23 02:21:12 UTC] yaslothy: MingLee
[2017-06-23 02:21:22 UTC] blue_blur64: He better not have issues with Pokemon. I'm still hoping for a Mystery Dungeon playthrough xD
[2017-06-23 02:21:24 UTC] chargeatdawn: He's playing Red Dead?
[2017-06-23 02:21:35 UTC] bloodbornenow: because of his voice, he said
[2017-06-23 02:21:40 UTC] mxtt10589: @ChargeatDawn night stream is for dangonrampa 2
[2017-06-23 02:21:49 UTC] blue_blur64: Maybe not mxtt
[2017-06-23 02:21:52 UTC] lookatmyjoker: one hour prestream rant incoming
[2017-06-23 02:21:53 UTC] chargeatdawn: Lame.
[2017-06-23 02:22:01 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: No you're lame Kappa
[2017-06-23 02:22:12 UTC] yaslothy: He's doing more rdr
[2017-06-23 02:22:27 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: Is he really, lame Kappa
[2017-06-23 02:22:37 UTC] elcrimsonking: can he even make scrilla off of pokemon tho?
[2017-06-23 02:22:46 UTC] elcrimsonking: $?
[2017-06-23 02:22:54 UTC] yaslothy: Ah neo you want more of that weeb action eh?
[2017-06-23 02:23:02 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: I missed his Dangonrompa start yesterday,
[2017-06-23 02:23:15 UTC] darksydephil: yeah im playing more RDR tonight
[2017-06-23 02:23:16 UTC] blue_blur64: I think so? I at least consider Pokemon a 2nd party title for Nintendo since they have no say on what they do with the games
[2017-06-23 02:23:17 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: i want to see how the story changed from the first game
[2017-06-23 02:23:19 UTC] darksydephil: throat can't handle danganronpa
[2017-06-23 02:23:23 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: oh ok
[2017-06-23 02:23:35 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: gl hf
[2017-06-23 02:23:48 UTC] elcrimsonking: interesting
[2017-06-23 02:23:48 UTC] mxtt10589: i marathoned it this morning, the reactions to the new characters were pretty funny
[2017-06-23 02:24:13 UTC] yaslothy: Time to get the wine out
[2017-06-23 02:24:18 UTC] yaslothy: OSsloth
[2017-06-23 02:24:28 UTC] elcrimsonking: lol thats messed up sloth
[2017-06-23 02:24:41 UTC] yaslothy: What?
[2017-06-23 02:24:45 UTC] blue_blur64: Think about it like this Crimson. People have been wanting a Pokemon game on consoles for a long time, since Gale of Darkness. Game Freak hasn't done that once until that E3 announced
[2017-06-23 02:24:50 UTC] dspfandood: i really like that joke you made delta mind if i use it for a tip? KappaHD
[2017-06-23 02:25:21 UTC] dspfandood: i will use your name tho since he might get mad dspHmm
[2017-06-23 02:25:34 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Nah
[2017-06-23 02:25:37 UTC] yaslothy: DansGame
[2017-06-23 02:25:37 UTC] mxtt10589: i don't care what gamefreak does anymore to the games, i just want another battle frontier
[2017-06-23 02:25:59 UTC] dspfandood: so thats a yes? ty
[2017-06-23 02:26:02 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Dont steal muh jokes okay
[2017-06-23 02:26:14 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Make your own
[2017-06-23 02:26:21 UTC] yaslothy: spikes spikes spikes
[2017-06-23 02:26:37 UTC] darksydephil: okay, who's ready for more RDR?
[2017-06-23 02:26:42 UTC] blue_blur64: But I do love the comment I saw after the Pokemon Direct that Game Freak "cucked the world" brownLUL
[2017-06-23 02:26:50 UTC] mxtt10589: ready and waiting
[2017-06-23 02:27:07 UTC] virtualradiver: I am

[2017-06-23 02:27:35 UTC] mxtt10589: i only have enough time for maybe a few hours though, sleep
[2017-06-23 02:27:39 UTC] capstonecommune: but phil SEGA and rockstar are following your twitter
[2017-06-23 02:27:52 UTC] blue_blur64: Sega does? O_o
[2017-06-23 02:28:07 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Since when?
[2017-06-23 02:28:13 UTC] capstonecommune: I think theyre thinking of claiming your stuff down
[2017-06-23 02:28:17 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh god that noise scared me xD
[2017-06-23 02:28:19 UTC] darksydephil: a bunch of game devs follow me
[2017-06-23 02:28:35 UTC] nich2440: and?
[2017-06-23 02:28:41 UTC] dspfandood: nice
[2017-06-23 02:28:43 UTC] capstonecommune: hope ur okay dood
[2017-06-23 02:28:43 UTC] blue_blur64: Phil, you gotta silence those in-game guns Kappa
[2017-06-23 02:28:45 UTC] darksydephil: what on earth are you talking about CapstoneCommune
[2017-06-23 02:28:50 UTC] darksydephil: seriously, enough with the conspiracy theories lol
[2017-06-23 02:28:51 UTC] yaslothy: lel

[2017-06-23 02:29:01 UTC] kingjezal: Stream is working
[2017-06-23 02:29:06 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Wow dood
[2017-06-23 02:29:09 UTC] blue_blur64: Yes, but Atlus mostly does their own thing
[2017-06-23 02:29:11 UTC] thearmettoast: Did this just start?
[2017-06-23 02:29:16 UTC] mxtt10589: yea
[2017-06-23 02:29:22 UTC] kingjezal: Just got the notification, so yeah.

The lawyer expenses will be astronomical and you won't have enough evidence on your side. You need a class-action lawsuit to even stand a chance, but you'll want to act fast because a single strike on a non-managed partner channel can make it non-parrnered. AKA Curse CAN drop you!

[2017-06-23 18:24:45 UTC] 0megaj0ker: so how does one cheat in Red Dead Poker?
[2017-06-23 18:25:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I didn't know you could cheat :D
[2017-06-23 18:25:08 UTC] akioartorius: you use the gentleman outfit or the elegant outfit to cheat in poker
[2017-06-23 18:25:10 UTC] theycallmejimbob: by going all in the whole time?
[2017-06-23 18:25:11 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: weeb dumass maybe be RIP dumass
[2017-06-23 18:25:12 UTC] b0atknight: couldn't they watch his stream and see his hands?
[2017-06-23 18:25:42 UTC] ratchefan12: @MakotoBestAssinPersona5 he may still play it relax
[2017-06-23 18:25:46 UTC] akioartorius: @0megaj0ker it was the outfit Clyde was wearing
[2017-06-23 18:25:53 UTC] 0megaj0ker: so how does the suit make him cheat exactly?
[2017-06-23 18:26:06 UTC] akioartorius: It has a hidden cards you can switch
[2017-06-23 18:26:07 UTC] xthewrath93x: he should drop RDR and play DBD
[2017-06-23 18:26:23 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @akioartorius that's what I was thinking
[2017-06-23 18:26:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he definitely wont be going past the 11/19 date if he does go back to it, people were saying Atlus was lax in enforcing it he wont take the risk
[2017-06-23 18:26:28 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Thanks guys
[2017-06-23 18:26:34 UTC] superbatcat: Hello people of chat, hope everyone is doing well.
[2017-06-23 18:26:50 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey superbatcat I'm good thanks and yourself
[2017-06-23 18:27:10 UTC] superbatcat: doing great
[2017-06-23 18:28:01 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: I don't think he will do a twitch and chill party pack anytime soon knowing all the Leanna answers
[2017-06-23 18:28:24 UTC] b0atknight: what are the Leanna Answers?
[2017-06-23 18:28:44 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Had a nice walk this morning and watched Blood Relatives on Investigation Discovery channel
[2017-06-23 18:29:24 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: your typical ones...Tyrone, BBC, leaving for LordVash
[2017-06-23 18:29:34 UTC] superbatcat: Blood Relatives?
[2017-06-23 18:29:48 UTC] 0megaj0ker: or Bloody Relatives
[2017-06-23 18:30:02 UTC] xthewrath93x: @MakotoBestAssinPersona5 that makes him a coward lol, he cant run forever
[2017-06-23 18:30:08 UTC] 0megaj0ker: it's show about one relative killing another for personal gain
[2017-06-23 18:30:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: anyone buy anything from the steam summer sale?
[2017-06-23 18:30:27 UTC] thirdeyethethird: i bought hollow knight
[2017-06-23 18:30:42 UTC] thirdeyethethird: and ds3 goty for a friend
[2017-06-23 18:30:53 UTC] superbatcat: nope not so far
[2017-06-23 18:31:17 UTC] thirdeyethethird: my backlog is so huge that I hate when the steam sale rolls around
[2017-06-23 18:31:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh good choice I was thinking of buying hollow knight but I'm subscribed to the humble monthly bundle it'll probably show up on it soon.
[2017-06-23 18:31:39 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: bought witcher 3 goty and rise of the tomb raider for gifts but nothing for myself
[2017-06-23 18:32:04 UTC] theycallmejimbob: didn't they change up the gifting system?
[2017-06-23 18:32:20 UTC] thirdeyethethird: same as it has always been really
[2017-06-23 18:32:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I thought before you could store a gift in your inventory now you have to send the gift immediately
[2017-06-23 18:33:10 UTC] thirdeyethethird: ahh maybe, i didnt notice that has changed
[2017-06-23 18:33:26 UTC] superbatcat: Have some games in my cart but won't buy till closer to the end of the sale.
[2017-06-23 18:33:47 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: yeah you can't store them, that's why they added a date and timer for when you want to send them
[2017-06-23 18:33:50 UTC] thirdeyethethird: maybe to discourage people from trying to access your account, because i'm sure you can have your inventory visible to the public
[2017-06-23 18:34:05 UTC] thirdeyethethird: for trading cards
[2017-06-23 18:34:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I think it's to prevent if there is a price glitch on steam someone exploiting it and buying 100 copies of it to sell on or swap for keys
[2017-06-23 18:34:33 UTC] thirdeyethethird: yeah that sounds logical too
[2017-06-23 18:35:03 UTC] sanguinenite: I love how years ago phil said that he didnt want to be an alarmist in 2011 and now... boy the difference... phil's over-reaction is nothing new these days
[2017-06-23 18:35:17 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: you can hide your gift inventory but I'm guessing it's to deter gifting from foreign countries. before you can buy gifts from russia for dirt cheap
[2017-06-23 18:35:39 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah I thought gifts from Russia would be region locked
[2017-06-23 18:35:51 UTC] thirdeyethethird: we all say things we go back on., eventually, people don't remain static all throughout the life
[2017-06-23 18:35:58 UTC] xthewrath93x: is DSP gonna be late today
[2017-06-23 18:36:01 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: I thought the same, guess nor
[2017-06-23 18:36:04 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: not
[2017-06-23 18:36:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: SanguineNite yeah patience isn't his virtue :P
[2017-06-23 18:36:40 UTC] 0megaj0ker: !schedule
[2017-06-23 18:36:40 UTC] nightbot: Red Dead Redemption at 12:30pm PDT, more at 7:30pm PDT!
[2017-06-23 18:36:49 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yeah they must be trying to stop sellers on g2a I guess
[2017-06-23 18:38:02 UTC] sanguinenite: nobody does, but it is better to stay silent about what you dont want to be. Honestly, I think Phil over-dramatizes how bad his finances are. if it were really that bad, the previous house would have been gone by now.
[2017-06-23 18:38:35 UTC] xthewrath93x: dsp once insulted twtich streamers who begged for money.... think about that for a sec
[2017-06-23 18:38:55 UTC] sanguinenite: he said it in a particular context so I can understand why he did that
[2017-06-23 18:38:59 UTC] thirdeyethethird: thought about it. don't care lol
[2017-06-23 18:39:02 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: but he 'matured' though
[2017-06-23 18:39:05 UTC] yaslothy: Hello hello
[2017-06-23 18:39:12 UTC] sanguinenite: Hey Cherdy
[2017-06-23 18:39:15 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey YaSchlothy
[2017-06-23 18:39:33 UTC] xthewrath93x: @thirdeyethethird but you dmed me abotu leanna a while ago
[2017-06-23 18:39:43 UTC] sanguinenite: I think he didnt want to go to twitch unless he had to, the circumstances forced him to do it so in his mind, he isnt a hypocrite
[2017-06-23 18:39:44 UTC] thirdeyethethird: dimed?
[2017-06-23 18:39:45 UTC] superbatcat: hello yaslothy

[2017-06-23 18:40:11 UTC] xthewrath93x: @YaSlothy sup doo
[2017-06-23 18:40:33 UTC] yaslothy: What's the topic today?
[2017-06-23 18:40:34 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: UncleNox StrawBeary the good old days when these two were together
[2017-06-23 18:40:46 UTC] sanguinenite: lol nothing too important
[2017-06-23 18:40:54 UTC] yaslothy: Kenny from Walking Dead?
[2017-06-23 18:40:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I think he should of waited for their response before he went with the doomsday scenario SanguineNite but what can you do
[2017-06-23 18:40:57 UTC] yaslothy: DansGame
[2017-06-23 18:41:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: steam sales and Phil's emergency video Slothy
[2017-06-23 18:41:29 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: @thirdeyethethird sympathy cheers
[2017-06-23 18:41:35 UTC] yaslothy: Ah right.
[2017-06-23 18:41:35 UTC] sanguinenite: @theycallmejimbob he over plays every little problem into a crisis to get views and attention I think, it is a way for him to get more money
[2017-06-23 18:41:40 UTC] xthewrath93x: @thirdeyethethird i have a message from you saying you hope leanna wises up lol
[2017-06-23 18:42:06 UTC] ratchefan12: @SanguineNite wtf dude
[2017-06-23 18:42:17 UTC] thirdeyethethird: @xthewrath93x yeah ok I vaguely remember that
[2017-06-23 18:42:21 UTC] sanguinenite: what? I am just saying an observation, hardly makes me a detractor
[2017-06-23 18:42:30 UTC] yaslothy: Well the best thing he can do now is bring back the P5 pt.
[2017-06-23 18:42:36 UTC] ratchefan12: @SanguineNite hang on a sec didnt say you were one
[2017-06-23 18:42:41 UTC] sanguinenite: uh no
[2017-06-23 18:43:01 UTC] xthewrath93x: people who give dsp constructive critism arent detractors
[2017-06-23 18:43:03 UTC] sanguinenite: The sok already banned me from joining nor did I have any interest in joining lol
[2017-06-23 18:43:08 UTC] xthewrath93x: y'all need to chill
[2017-06-23 18:43:13 UTC] ratchefan12: @SanguineNite i didnt say you were one
[2017-06-23 18:43:20 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: I think he will keep the P5 playlist private for just a bit longer
[2017-06-23 18:43:21 UTC] yaslothy: lel
[2017-06-23 18:43:33 UTC] ratchefan12: @SanguineNite sorry dude
[2017-06-23 18:43:37 UTC] xthewrath93x: tyrone magnus
[2017-06-23 18:43:39 UTC] sanguinenite: lol its okay
[2017-06-23 18:43:51 UTC] sanguinenite: people on phil's chat are edgy and I can understand why
[2017-06-23 18:43:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Yaslothy buy anything from the steam sale TearGlove
[2017-06-23 18:43:56 UTC] ratchefan12: @SanguineNite the sok just fucking piss me off
[2017-06-23 18:44:16 UTC] yaslothy: No jimmy not yet, I got 2 weeks though Kreygasm
[2017-06-23 18:44:19 UTC] yaslothy: You?
[2017-06-23 18:44:22 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I know, I hope someone can pretend to be an sok and get to their servers to take it down like they did years ago lol
[2017-06-23 18:44:25 UTC] ratchefan12: @SanguineNite why do you thin kthey are edgy
[2017-06-23 18:44:26 UTC] xthewrath93x: @ratchefan12 what did the ydo
[2017-06-23 18:44:44 UTC] thirdeyethethird: a detractor is basically one who comes in to chat just to shit on phil, but people who defend him until their dying breath are not any better really, fanatics
[2017-06-23 18:45:03 UTC] sanguinenite: I would have to agree thethird
[2017-06-23 18:45:04 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I'm looking at the classic bethesda bundle and the telltale bundle I have a few of the games from both so the price is greatly reduced YaSlothy

[2017-06-23 18:46:17 UTC] thirdeyethethird: @ratchefan12 most people don't find that attractive yeah
[2017-06-23 18:46:23 UTC] superbatcat: Hey Rune_XL
[2017-06-23 18:46:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Nuh uh uh no more persona ban BeTheAllen
[2017-06-23 18:46:38 UTC] sanguinenite: lol you might have to backpaddle on that @BeTheAllen
[2017-06-23 18:46:45 UTC] betheallen: jimbob he said he doesnt care what happens HE IS DONE WITH ATLUS
[2017-06-23 18:46:51 UTC] sanguinenite: Atlus said it was a mistake
[2017-06-23 18:46:55 UTC] sanguinenite: lol
[2017-06-23 18:47:01 UTC] ratchefan12: @BeTheAllen lol too bad
[2017-06-23 18:47:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it was a misunderstanding TearGlove Atlus didn't see it coming BeTheAllen
[2017-06-23 18:47:13 UTC] yaslothy: Atlus >
[2017-06-23 18:47:18 UTC] betheallen: when did phil say he is going back to tha t
[2017-06-23 18:47:18 UTC] sanguinenite: did he say that? he said that it might be an honest mistake but he was going to make an overly dramatic video anyway
[2017-06-23 18:47:22 UTC] thirdeyethethird: so the Personna 5 playthrough is no more?
[2017-06-23 18:47:25 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: to be fair the shit some DSP white knights said about the SOK member who died of cancer is just as bad as what the detractors do. Both as bad as each other
[2017-06-23 18:47:26 UTC] betheallen: i dont recall
[2017-06-23 18:47:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he said he was never gonna play another Atlus game again SanguineNite
[2017-06-23 18:47:50 UTC] yaslothy: The pt should be fine but I'm sure he'll discontinue you it anyway.
[2017-06-23 18:47:51 UTC] sanguinenite: only if they never take down the strike
[2017-06-23 18:47:51 UTC] ratchefan12: @MakotoBestAssinPersona5 an sok member died of cancer?
[2017-06-23 18:47:51 UTC] betheallen: exactly
[2017-06-23 18:48:08 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I presume he might reconsider it thirdeyethethird since it was a misunderstanding
[2017-06-23 18:48:11 UTC] sanguinenite: I wont be surprised if phil changes his mind, he often does that
[2017-06-23 18:48:24 UTC] thirdeyethethird: @MakotoBestAssinPersona5 that's what tribe mentality breeds. people on dsp side and the sok side have shitty people supporting them
[2017-06-23 18:48:26 UTC] yaslothy: @makotobestassinpersona5 oh yeah I remember that.
[2017-06-23 18:48:38 UTC] sanguinenite: @MakotoBestAssinPersona5 Actually there are some people that deserve cancer and worse things in their life.
[2017-06-23 18:48:53 UTC] thirdeyethethird: those people are a minority, but they're the loudest
[2017-06-23 18:48:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn that's the lowest of the low :(
[2017-06-23 18:49:02 UTC] superbatcat: Happiness is a calm chat

[2017-06-23 18:49:46 UTC] betheallen: FUCK ATLUS
[2017-06-23 18:49:50 UTC] yaslothy: Just because someone dislikes Phil doesn't mean they deserve cancer.
[2017-06-23 18:49:56 UTC] sanguinenite: lets see betheallen
[2017-06-23 18:50:10 UTC] yaslothy: Bethe danganronpa hype

[2017-06-23 18:50:58 UTC] yaslothy: DansGame
[2017-06-23 18:51:14 UTC] makotobestassinpersona5: @ratchefan12 yeah her name was Alice. She was hardly the worse detractor in the group but she didn't deserve to die like some of Phil's white knights said
[2017-06-23 18:51:22 UTC] yaslothy: Now now bethe that's not how a mod acts.
[2017-06-23 18:51:27 UTC] cresstheangel: right bethe isn't here anyway on 2nd stream so hes hating on Danganronpa 2 for no reason Kappa
[2017-06-23 18:51:34 UTC] betheallen: ratchefan so phil said he dont care if its cleared up or not he was done with em

[2017-06-23 18:51:59 UTC] betheallen: meant
[2017-06-23 18:52:07 UTC] sanguinenite: I am going to stay watching phil mainly for his VN LPs like Danganronpa. Hope he stops having throat issues that he keeps changing the schedule
[2017-06-23 18:52:14 UTC] betheallen: phil is still done with atlus
[2017-06-23 18:52:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: well it was in the heat of the moment BeTheAllen he was talking about lawsuits etc so luckily it was all a misunderstanding
[2017-06-23 18:52:19 UTC] betheallen: i believe what phil said
[2017-06-23 18:52:29 UTC] sanguinenite: @BeTheAllen you can only hope phil doesnt change his mind lol
[2017-06-23 18:52:32 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it is indeed good news Adam
[2017-06-23 18:52:53 UTC] yaslothy: Persona isn't worth it for AHNNNN bethe?

You receive claims on all Nintendo uploads and are profiting off Nintendo games on Twitch. Nintendo is getting more involved in Twitch and might be tired of issuing claims, going for a channel strike instead. I would hate for you to let your $300 Switch gather dust because Nintendo could issue a strike to shut down DSPGaming. Your friend, atlusinyourass
