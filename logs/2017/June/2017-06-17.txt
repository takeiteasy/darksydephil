[2017-06-17 00:00:14 UTC] philandchill: Though good thought and conceptualizing is often a bit more interesting than action
[2017-06-17 00:00:16 UTC] yaslothy: north by northwest, vertigo SeemsGood
[2017-06-17 00:01:55 UTC] hisui4: @philandchill true :)
[2017-06-17 00:01:57 UTC] philandchill: God, Vertigo is one of the best OSTs I've heard
[2017-06-17 00:02:17 UTC] yaslothy: yes
[2017-06-17 00:02:44 UTC] misterdragin: revenge will never get old Kappa
[2017-06-17 00:04:15 UTC] yaslothy: humina humina
[2017-06-17 00:05:38 UTC] philandchill: That classic mystery-noir style to that OST, gaw. Kind of makes me want to play Heavy Rain
[2017-06-17 00:06:28 UTC] hisui4: @misterdragin TehePelo VoteYea
[2017-06-17 00:06:40 UTC] yaslothy: yeah Bernard Herrmann man
[2017-06-17 00:06:45 UTC] yaslothy: mann man
[2017-06-17 00:07:29 UTC] hisui4: heavy rain has an excellent plot. i think its better than most movies and series outside of games by itself.
[2017-06-17 00:07:45 UTC] yaslothy: yeah I know david cage is a meme but I like the games
[2017-06-17 00:08:00 UTC] yaslothy: theres problems with his games but I enjoy them overall
[2017-06-17 00:08:23 UTC] hisui4: who is david cage?
[2017-06-17 00:09:03 UTC] yaslothy: head guy of heavy rain, indigo prophecy, beyond two souls and detroit
[2017-06-17 00:09:10 UTC] philandchill: Youtube search the main theme of Vertigo. then @ 2:38 is when "film style" got mastered once again, right when it turns into a major chord. I've heard this "opening credits" style of music reused in so many movies thereafter
[2017-06-17 00:09:11 UTC] yaslothy: he gets a lot of shit
[2017-06-17 00:09:30 UTC] philandchill: Genius
[2017-06-17 00:09:44 UTC] yaslothy: true @PhilAndChill
[2017-06-17 00:09:59 UTC] yaslothy: vertigo is actually my fav hitchcockl
[2017-06-17 00:10:16 UTC] misterdragin: yea but transformers man
[2017-06-17 00:10:20 UTC] misterdragin: dass a movie
[2017-06-17 00:10:26 UTC] yaslothy: wut
[2017-06-17 00:10:30 UTC] misterdragin: check it out mayne the robot had balls so funny dood
[2017-06-17 00:10:39 UTC] yaslothy: wow dood
[2017-06-17 00:10:41 UTC] misterdragin: they were metal
[2017-06-17 00:10:54 UTC] hisui4: @yaslothy ahh i see. well when you do something different and imperfect on top of that, youre gonna get a lot of flack. but his games are awesome. I find it hilarious people are pro-telltale while at least david cage's games gives you real choices with different endings.
[2017-06-17 00:11:19 UTC] misterdragin: fokk telltale
[2017-06-17 00:11:23 UTC] yaslothy: here we go
[2017-06-17 00:11:24 UTC] hisui4: telltale games cant do it as well as david can
[2017-06-17 00:11:49 UTC] hisui4: yet david gets more negativity which is sad
[2017-06-17 00:11:53 UTC] misterdragin: telltale batman sucks
[2017-06-17 00:12:23 UTC] yaslothy: RalpherZ
[2017-06-17 00:12:30 UTC] hisui4: lol
[2017-06-17 00:12:32 UTC] philandchill: David Cage hate is kind of like Phil hate. mostly mindless whining about trivial details which don't matter to the big picture
[2017-06-17 00:12:42 UTC] hisui4: true
[2017-06-17 00:12:43 UTC] philandchill: Heavy Rain is...
[2017-06-17 00:12:53 UTC] misterdragin: btw will smith's son is batshit crazy. he made a song called batman. he's dessed in an all white batman suit and goes "batman, batman, batman" mumble rap shit you can't understand "batman, batman, batman"
[2017-06-17 00:12:53 UTC] philandchill: inspirational, in a way
[2017-06-17 00:13:17 UTC] philandchill: One of my favorite games nonetheless
[2017-06-17 00:13:18 UTC] yaslothy: yeah but is he just joking
[2017-06-17 00:13:23 UTC] misterdragin: no
[2017-06-17 00:13:28 UTC] yaslothy: okay
[2017-06-17 00:13:38 UTC] misterdragin: he's an ARTIST
[2017-06-17 00:14:12 UTC] hisui4: lol XD will Smith's son went into rap before he knew what it was so i cant even blame him, its his dad's fault
[2017-06-17 00:14:51 UTC] yaslothy: i barely like will smith so...
[2017-06-17 00:14:56 UTC] philandchill: It's difficult to find really good gameplays in games
[2017-06-17 00:15:43 UTC] misterdragin: Batman, Batman, BatmanHeard that you ain't got a mattressHeard that you king of ManhattanYou always stay in the 'Basas
[2017-06-17 00:15:56 UTC] misterdragin: :D
[2017-06-17 00:16:02 UTC] yaslothy: DansGame
[2017-06-17 00:16:15 UTC] philandchill: Esp gameplays that offer a good enough diversity of options and stuff to wrap your mind around. Puzzles within how the game works
[2017-06-17 00:16:16 UTC] hisui4: @philandchill heavy rain has great narrative, true choices, multiple endings, and its fun to play. telltale is like a bootleg version of heavy rain yet it has a mass following and tons of hype and no one argues whether or not telltale games are legit games. but they bring that argument up for david cage. its like they forget walking dead is illusion of choice with quicktime events. lol
[2017-06-17 00:17:04 UTC] hisui4: @misterdragin lol will Smith couldn't teach his son how to rap XD
[2017-06-17 00:17:14 UTC] misterdragin: he talks about getting divorced from batman in the song. and something something skywalker with the force. d'artiste amking noise :D
[2017-06-17 00:17:21 UTC] misterdragin: making*
[2017-06-17 00:17:21 UTC] philandchill: I really fail to understand the average person hisui4. I do really dislike the Walking Dead games, for those reasons not just the artstyle
[2017-06-17 00:17:24 UTC] misterdragin: artiste
[2017-06-17 00:17:26 UTC] misterdragin: :D
[2017-06-17 00:17:29 UTC] misterdragin: my goodness
[2017-06-17 00:17:43 UTC] hisui4: @philandchill same
[2017-06-17 00:17:58 UTC] yaslothy: wow
[2017-06-17 00:18:39 UTC] philandchill: I can't wrap my mind around what it is hisui4, but if you figure it out, let me know.
[2017-06-17 00:18:46 UTC] hisui4: @misterdragin he mentions divorcing batman?! whaas :0
[2017-06-17 00:19:47 UTC] misterdragin: yeah he's just rambling
[2017-06-17 00:20:03 UTC] misterdragin: Batman, Batman, BatmanI heard you married a PorscheThat shit is all in the pastPlus we got very divorcedYou ain't ready for the warSkywalker with the Force1, 2, 3, 4—D'artiste is making noise
[2017-06-17 00:20:04 UTC] yaslothy: idiet
[2017-06-17 00:20:21 UTC] misterdragin: the d'artiste thing kills me
[2017-06-17 00:20:25 UTC] misterdragin: :D
[2017-06-17 00:20:40 UTC] hisui4: @philandchill lol sure i doubt i'll be able to. though it might be that walking dead and Batman already have fan followings. so its easier to get support than a ne IP like heavy rain and david's other games. telltale does remakes of comic books and tv series and movies. so people are hyped up by default
[2017-06-17 00:22:19 UTC] philandchill: @hisui4: "Guys look, this game is like a better version of this one you like so much on steroids. It just has a new theme to it."
[2017-06-17 00:22:27 UTC] philandchill: "Yeah, but it aint hip. Can't you dig?"
[2017-06-17 00:23:00 UTC] hisui4: @philandchill lolz XD
[2017-06-17 00:24:15 UTC] hisui4: true. at least david cage improves on his games. telltale just does the same thing over and over again. i actually think their games are getting worse per release
[2017-06-17 00:26:34 UTC] philandchill: one of my favorite videos on gaming in general is
[2017-06-17 00:27:05 UTC] philandchill: my favorite one, a critique on adventure games
[2017-06-17 00:27:09 UTC] philandchill: it's called
[2017-06-17 00:28:09 UTC] philandchill: Yes, "The Death of Adventure" by fat owl
[2017-06-17 00:29:28 UTC] philandchill: A lot of it is, old adventure games are outdated and cryptic, but they offer a lot of diamond in the rough that's totally missing from today's games
[2017-06-17 00:30:57 UTC] yaslothy: dig it baby dig it baby dig it
[2017-06-17 00:31:34 UTC] philandchill: And how story used to be more about the gameplay, I think is very true of Heavy Rain and classic point and clicks
[2017-06-17 00:31:59 UTC] philandchill: Now it's downgraded to games having just story, or story that doesn't cleverly intertwine or equal the gameplay itself
[2017-06-17 00:32:46 UTC] yaslothy: I like all genre of game, I'm easy to please.
[2017-06-17 00:32:51 UTC] philandchill: How the story in games used to be more of the challenge and puzzle, more exploring/thinking on your own
[2017-06-17 00:32:58 UTC] misterdragin: all expect SMB
[2017-06-17 00:32:58 UTC] yaslothy: sodomize me with a rusty fishing knife.
[2017-06-17 00:33:03 UTC] misterdragin: except*
[2017-06-17 00:33:04 UTC] yaslothy: i like that game
[2017-06-17 00:33:19 UTC] yaslothy: its just fucking hard
[2017-06-17 00:33:33 UTC] yaslothy: I'm not the BIGGEST fan of that style of game, indie style platformer but I do like it.
[2017-06-17 00:34:01 UTC] yaslothy: like Limbo and Inside are...eh...
[2017-06-17 00:34:03 UTC] misterdragin: liar liar
[2017-06-17 00:34:09 UTC] misterdragin: slothy on fire
[2017-06-17 00:34:13 UTC] yaslothy: OSsloth
[2017-06-17 00:34:48 UTC] yaslothy: *flashes back to that time Phil met big foot in RDR and he wanted to commit suicide so Phil lit him on fire and watched him suffer*
[2017-06-17 00:34:53 UTC] yaslothy: and John Rambo was like DBstyle
[2017-06-17 00:35:22 UTC] misterdragin: fun times
[2017-06-17 00:35:27 UTC] yaslothy: SeemsGood
[2017-06-17 00:35:33 UTC] misterdragin: do you believe in big foot?
[2017-06-17 00:35:36 UTC] yaslothy: no
[2017-06-17 00:35:54 UTC] yaslothy: although i'm in "big foot country"
[2017-06-17 00:36:25 UTC] misterdragin: your illuminati masters forbid you from talking about it..gotcha
[2017-06-17 00:36:32 UTC] yaslothy: DansGame
[2017-06-17 00:36:48 UTC] yaslothy: oh bobbi broke my emote thumb off again
[2017-06-17 00:36:55 UTC] misterdragin: it's ok, I figured you out
[2017-06-17 00:37:02 UTC] misterdragin: lol bobbi might quit the chat
[2017-06-17 00:37:05 UTC] yaslothy: no
[2017-06-17 00:37:07 UTC] yaslothy: no no no
[2017-06-17 00:37:28 UTC] misterdragin: betheMOD is not in her vocabulary
[2017-06-17 00:37:33 UTC] misterdragin: she can;t fathom
[2017-06-17 00:37:53 UTC] yaslothy: if bethe mentions starbuck....
[2017-06-17 00:37:58 UTC] yaslothy: I'mma go ham
[2017-06-17 00:38:03 UTC] yaslothy: and you won't see my fatass again
[2017-06-17 00:38:19 UTC] misterdragin: :)
[2017-06-17 00:38:29 UTC] misterdragin: he is usually nice in her chat
[2017-06-17 00:38:39 UTC] misterdragin: bu bethe is bethe.. and he slips into lewd stuf
[2017-06-17 00:38:43 UTC] yaslothy: I wouldn't know. I'm scarred for life.
[2017-06-17 00:39:12 UTC] misterdragin: he enjoyed watching her getting tipsy
[2017-06-17 00:39:16 UTC] misterdragin: he's a predato
[2017-06-17 00:39:17 UTC] misterdragin: r
[2017-06-17 00:39:18 UTC] yaslothy: I never should have told you guys I was watching her. Should have put my shit on invisible and kept my mouth shut.
[2017-06-17 00:39:38 UTC] misterdragin: I talked to her about headphones
[2017-06-17 00:39:45 UTC] yaslothy: oh nice
[2017-06-17 00:39:46 UTC] misterdragin: and new zealand
[2017-06-17 00:39:49 UTC] yaslothy: A civil convo
[2017-06-17 00:39:51 UTC] yaslothy: :)
[2017-06-17 00:40:12 UTC] misterdragin: I complimente dher on her sennheiser cans
[2017-06-17 00:40:20 UTC] yaslothy: i like it :)
[2017-06-17 00:40:27 UTC] yaslothy: what a gentleman
[2017-06-17 00:40:30 UTC] misterdragin: made me hard to see she appreciates good stuff, not the kiddie gaming headsets
[2017-06-17 00:40:38 UTC] yaslothy: ...
[2017-06-17 00:40:44 UTC] yaslothy: troo troo
[2017-06-17 00:40:46 UTC] misterdragin: I didn't say that of course
[2017-06-17 00:41:04 UTC] yaslothy: at least you didn't talk about shoving korn up her asshole.
[2017-06-17 00:41:15 UTC] misterdragin: myeah..
[2017-06-17 00:41:38 UTC] yaslothy: and if you did think that, at least kept it inside your noggin. :)
[2017-06-17 00:42:27 UTC] misterdragin: I wish I was kidding, but she's the only non-boobie girl streamer I know of on twitch
[2017-06-17 00:42:53 UTC] yaslothy: well that's a compliment I guess.
[2017-06-17 00:43:04 UTC] misterdragin: well maybe kaceytron counts because hse basically parodies that type of "gamer", but she does expose her tittays
[2017-06-17 00:43:05 UTC] yaslothy: I mean gamermd83 is cool too, but she doesn't stream much
[2017-06-17 00:43:15 UTC] misterdragin: she*
[2017-06-17 00:43:38 UTC] misterdragin: she plays a caharacter
[2017-06-17 00:43:50 UTC] yaslothy: ah
[2017-06-17 00:43:51 UTC] misterdragin: character* dammit

[2017-06-17 00:44:19 UTC] misterdragin: funniest guy on twitch by far is dr. disrespect :)
[2017-06-17 00:44:31 UTC] yaslothy: hmm
[2017-06-17 00:45:01 UTC] hisui4: i know plenty of non boobie girl streamers and youtubers. however they mainly play otome games or fashion hauls from Japanese brands i follow. mostly lolita fashion.
[2017-06-17 00:45:37 UTC] hisui4: otome games - date sim games for girls
[2017-06-17 00:45:40 UTC] misterdragin: loli fashion ew
[2017-06-17 00:45:52 UTC] hisui4: its not what you think
[2017-06-17 00:45:53 UTC] misterdragin: yeah I meant "serious" gamers
[2017-06-17 00:46:17 UTC] yaslothy: is it sad I'm just now getting into google chrome extensions
[2017-06-17 00:46:22 UTC] hisui4: loli fashion is the clothes that Lili wears in tekken
[2017-06-17 00:46:23 UTC] yaslothy: like gmail, twitch, speedtest
[2017-06-17 00:46:43 UTC] misterdragin: lilipichu Kappa
[2017-06-17 00:46:44 UTC] hisui4: eliza also dresses in loli fashion
[2017-06-17 00:47:36 UTC] misterdragin: so you like..extensions, slothy? :) ;)
[2017-06-17 00:47:37 UTC] yaslothy: some japanese stuff can get kind of creepy so I try to stay away
[2017-06-17 00:47:40 UTC] hisui4: frills lace and gorgeousness resembling the baroque period in france
[2017-06-17 00:47:44 UTC] yaslothy: just my opinion of course
[2017-06-17 00:47:48 UTC] hisui4: thats lolita fashion
[2017-06-17 00:47:50 UTC] yaslothy: yes draggy
[2017-06-17 00:47:55 UTC] misterdragin: :)
[2017-06-17 00:48:12 UTC] misterdragin: well I hope you didn't buy the pills

[2017-06-17 00:49:02 UTC] yaslothy: I'm an average man

[2017-06-17 00:50:20 UTC] yaslothy: no no
[2017-06-17 00:50:24 UTC] yaslothy: don't blame yourself
[2017-06-17 00:51:19 UTC] hisui4: my favorite lolita brands are baby the stars shine bright and alice & the pirates. im not a fan of angelic pretty.
[2017-06-17 00:51:37 UTC] hisui4: my favorite punk brand is putumayo
[2017-06-17 00:51:47 UTC] misterdragin: you know too much about this stuff, you're creeping me out
[2017-06-17 00:52:18 UTC] misterdragin: for your sake I hope you're using VPNs
[2017-06-17 00:52:19 UTC] yaslothy: uh oh
[2017-06-17 00:52:20 UTC] misterdragin: Kappa
[2017-06-17 00:52:29 UTC] hisui4: lol i know a heck of a lot about lolita fashion and japanese fashion in general haha xD
[2017-06-17 00:52:35 UTC] yaslothy: DBstyle
[2017-06-17 00:52:39 UTC] yaslothy: express vpn is quite good
[2017-06-17 00:52:55 UTC] yaslothy: but I don't suggest using it for weird shit DansGame
[2017-06-17 00:53:10 UTC] yaslothy: that's on you if you choose to do so...don't include me in that shit DansGame
[2017-06-17 00:53:16 UTC] hisui4: really, Lili dresses in lolita fashion. you dont like Lili?
[2017-06-17 00:53:31 UTC] yaslothy: isn't she underrage
[2017-06-17 00:53:43 UTC] hisui4: adults dress that way too.
[2017-06-17 00:54:34 UTC] hisui4: actually, irl, its mostly young adults who wear what Lili and Eliza wears. Eliza is also dressed in lolita fashion.
[2017-06-17 00:54:48 UTC] yaslothy: DBstyle
[2017-06-17 00:55:05 UTC] hisui4: any outfit you see that resembles the victorian and baroque era of france with tons of frills and stuff is considered Lolita fashion.
[2017-06-17 00:55:24 UTC] bomber_man_mulayim: Hi guys, Phil streaming soon?
[2017-06-17 00:55:28 UTC] hisui4: just google it. :o
[2017-06-17 00:55:50 UTC] yaslothy: nah im good on that but thanks for the info i guess :D
[2017-06-17 00:55:55 UTC] misterdragin: so if police were to seize your HDD.. you wouldn't be..worried, right?
[2017-06-17 00:55:55 UTC] hisui4: @bomber_man_mulayim i dunno. it almost 9pm where i am. i havent heard from him for a long time.
[2017-06-17 00:56:22 UTC] hisui4: @misterdragin no. because lolita fashion has nothing to do with underage girls. again, just google it.
[2017-06-17 00:56:48 UTC] bomber_man_mulayim: ah so you guys hang out here even tho there is no stream? hehe nice ;)
[2017-06-17 00:56:56 UTC] yaslothy: maybe im just misinformed
[2017-06-17 00:56:58 UTC] yaslothy: but anyways
[2017-06-17 00:57:10 UTC] yaslothy: @Bomber_Man_Mulayim usually not but fuck it
[2017-06-17 00:57:19 UTC] yaslothy: im ronery

[2017-06-17 19:39:00 UTC] planetjeff2: OK - now that we're a few minutes in, I'll honestly share - I really don't like fighting games, at all. I really prefer something with a story or narrative content. But, I've supported Phil for awhile, and will continue to do so. He does something almost nobody else does - raw playthroughs, and I do like his style. (yes, not perfect, but I've long learned that perfection is not practical) Looking forward to something else soon...

[2017-06-17 20:05:25 UTC] chrisbreezy00: once you play the 5 1st party games you might as well donate your switch
[2017-06-17 20:05:29 UTC] systemtree: switch is getting the popular franchises on its system though. They are literally the best at marketing. Nintendo always have been

[2017-06-17 20:07:40 UTC] derichloveslemur: Is the stream behind?
[2017-06-17 20:07:41 UTC] jackwhite202: @BeTheAllen hope yamcha is in it XD
[2017-06-17 20:07:46 UTC] derpie12: Well it can be serious if you go to Ranked

[2017-06-17 20:09:30 UTC] stuart360: 60mil PS4's sold, 36mil XB1's sold, consoles are going nowhere, and thats coming from a PC gamer. A lot of people don't want the hassle involved with PC gaming, and i don't blame them

[2017-06-17 20:10:25 UTC] akioartorius: you buy things
[2017-06-17 20:10:28 UTC] systemtree: The DLC for this game should be LEGS where it allows you to kick aswell
[2017-06-17 20:10:30 UTC] chrisbreezy00: i just dont know if they will add the more side characters like Tien and yamcha
[2017-06-17 20:10:33 UTC] dukaduka: @joeshmo192 buy lootboxes Kappa
[2017-06-17 20:10:34 UTC] systemtree: it wont sell Kappa

[2017-06-17 20:10:46 UTC] sam_the_jew: people that pay 500+ for a console are just ignorant and are actually screwing them selves because a pc is so much more than just a gaming too...pluss pc master race
[2017-06-17 20:10:55 UTC] systemtree: then the title of the game is DansGame
[2017-06-17 20:10:57 UTC] somethingyer2: shut up jew
[2017-06-17 20:11:01 UTC] guccikodak: i could see smash players liking this
[2017-06-17 20:11:08 UTC] dukaduka: @systemtree this game will probably have a person who kicks instead of punches, like divekick has someone who kicks with their hands :D
[2017-06-17 20:11:08 UTC] butter__my__bread: scrub out a win against hedlox phil markHeart

[2017-06-17 20:11:48 UTC] betheallen: jimbob they can still win this though
[2017-06-17 20:11:51 UTC] storme01: IT's a simple fighting game with a high skill ceiling. I like that it get's depth from something other than combos
[2017-06-17 20:11:52 UTC] deathodus987: Watching Phil is kind of like watching Nascar, Triple hook, left hook, grab shittalk for no reason repeat.
[2017-06-17 20:11:57 UTC] stuart360: The Xbox One S is, even the X would be a decent price for a good UHD BluRay player

[2017-06-17 20:13:03 UTC] chrisbreezy00: im curious if they will add any of the lesser transformations for the villians because they only showed final form frieza and perfect cell
[2017-06-17 20:13:15 UTC] chrisbreezy00: it would be cool to play as 1st form frieza and gradually power up
[2017-06-17 20:13:15 UTC] jackwhite202: @chrisbreezy00 dont think so
[2017-06-17 20:13:21 UTC] derpie12: Airhead if you want him to respond you better hand some bits over

[2017-06-17 20:14:49 UTC] chrisbreezy00: yea i can see them adding atleast the 3 buus

[2017-06-17 20:17:45 UTC] jackwhite202: @chrisbreezy00 it would be cool to add fusions as well like gotenks and vegito
[2017-06-17 20:17:48 UTC] dukaduka: @jackwhite202 i looked it up and i played dragonball BT3 which is the only place he's called super jenemba LUL go figure
[2017-06-17 20:17:48 UTC] stuart360: Anyone think there is ANY chance Desitiny 2 will pull a WatchDogs 2 and under perform compared to the first game?
[2017-06-17 20:18:01 UTC] chrisbreezy00: i think atleast Vegito would be added and gotenks
[2017-06-17 20:18:18 UTC] derichloveslemur: @derpie12 I can't ATM. If I would I would watch ads for bits. But I don't have that function.
[2017-06-17 20:18:19 UTC] dukaduka: do you think they will add videl and hercule?
[2017-06-17 20:18:25 UTC] kushiyakitori: @stuart360 the sequel won't be as badly marred as WD2 was from its predecessor and D2 also has an extra platform. it'll be fine
[2017-06-17 20:18:30 UTC] somethingyer2: i think out of all fusions, Gotenks would be added
[2017-06-17 20:18:33 UTC] somethingyer2: hes the most unique
[2017-06-17 20:18:39 UTC] jackwhite202: @dukaduka well in the movie when he shouts his name he says janempa and in super form he says janemba
[2017-06-17 20:18:41 UTC] derpie12: @stuart360 would love it too but I can see it not selling as well
[2017-06-17 20:18:44 UTC] deathodus987: Maybe if you didnt jump into the middle of them
[2017-06-17 20:18:51 UTC] chrisbreezy00: it would be cool if they had the fusion mechanic in game like if you have a team with goku and vegeta in it you could manually fuse and lose both characters to get an OP character
[2017-06-17 20:18:56 UTC] dukaduka: @stuart360 what? Watchdog 2 did waay better than the first one. If anything Destiny 2 will be more fleshed out
[2017-06-17 20:18:58 UTC] jackwhite202: @dukaduka no definetly not mr satan and videl
[2017-06-17 20:19:07 UTC] kushiyakitori: when they are fightning each other he should just let them be

[2017-06-17 20:19:50 UTC] stuart360: No WatchDogs 2 underperformed compared to the first game, Google it. The first WatchDogs was a surprisingly big seller
[2017-06-17 20:19:51 UTC] dspfandood: is he doing this all stream? ResidentSleeper
[2017-06-17 20:19:53 UTC] chrisbreezy00: yea jack like in the middle of the match you could fuse kinda like in the old games Budokai 3 and shit
[2017-06-17 20:19:54 UTC] dukaduka: also no hercule is a sad day for dbz :(
[2017-06-17 20:19:56 UTC] sonicwe: so im ready for more p5 tommrow

[2017-06-17 20:21:07 UTC] jackwhite202: @dukaduka hercule is a weakling hes weaker than master roshi
[2017-06-17 20:21:08 UTC] betheallen: i just find it funny that phil goes on a 4 win streak then messes it up :D jimbob
[2017-06-17 20:21:11 UTC] dukaduka: @chrisbreezy00 i've seen it and oh boy it is crazy the number of fusions that game has
[2017-06-17 20:21:17 UTC] storme01: Then again it's a Nintendo handheld so I guess I'm just stating the obvious
[2017-06-17 20:21:20 UTC] stuart360: What does the Switch offer?, 5 games a year?, motion shite?
[2017-06-17 20:21:31 UTC] dukaduka: @jackwhite202 but he's fun :D he's like the dan of the series

[2017-06-17 20:51:14 UTC] goldencolts: its the craft brew in a can (tm)
[2017-06-17 20:51:18 UTC] yaslothy: @BeTheAllen Yes, true. But I feel for some reason tea is more healthy.
[2017-06-17 20:51:23 UTC] jiv_: cross play Not4ThePlayers
[2017-06-17 20:51:27 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: gin is the best i love it

[2017-06-17 20:52:47 UTC] stuart360: Not bad Derich, just needsma bit more salt
[2017-06-17 20:52:49 UTC] betheallen: get hyped son
[2017-06-17 20:52:50 UTC] derpie12: Some feel ARMS may be more fun to play rather than watch but perhaps part of why this may be a tad boring is due to Phil not touching at any other characters
[2017-06-17 20:52:54 UTC] goldencolts: hes out there, watching, waiting TheIlluminati
[2017-06-17 20:53:04 UTC] cinsolace92: man the ass kissers in here.....for shame
[2017-06-17 20:53:09 UTC] mto2089: cant wait for some danganronpa 2 this week

[2017-06-17 20:53:54 UTC] stuart360: Yeah Phil must like the game Derich because he's still playing even though the vids will be claimed by Nintendo
[2017-06-17 20:54:08 UTC] mto2089: i think zelda is his GOTY
[2017-06-17 20:54:10 UTC] mto2089: as of now
[2017-06-17 20:54:31 UTC] yaslothy: Has Bobbi been around today?
[2017-06-17 20:54:42 UTC] betheallen: me and my wife been looking at pics of families and there little girls are so adorable and pretty, hope my baby girl is like those kids :)
[2017-06-17 20:54:47 UTC] betheallen: no sloth
[2017-06-17 20:54:47 UTC] derpie12: Also Phil should do ranked that's where he can get rekt to real salt but I feel the only reason I can see DSP dropping this game is due to lack of interest
[2017-06-17 20:54:52 UTC] stuart360: I haven't seen Bobbi for a few days, i don't know why....
[2017-06-17 20:54:52 UTC] derichloveslemur: @stuart360 it's just dumb Nintendo is claiming first title games which includes ARMS.
[2017-06-17 20:55:03 UTC] whalekerminsouijaboard: Why do those master of stealth clothes have bono's head on them
[2017-06-17 20:55:15 UTC] yaslothy: I think I know why @stuart360 :p
[2017-06-17 20:55:22 UTC] mto2089: i am curious about mario and rabbids if nintendo can claim those videos despite ubisoft being heavily involved
[2017-06-17 20:55:29 UTC] betheallen: not me sloth
[2017-06-17 20:55:36 UTC] derpie12: Funnily now it ain't just Nintendo claiming

[2017-06-17 20:56:24 UTC] betheallen: huh sloth?

[2017-06-17 20:56:54 UTC] yaslothy: Well, you're mod now and she's not a big fan of that, just saying.
[2017-06-17 20:56:57 UTC] mto2089: wonder if ubisoft will can that then again they did try and damage control Ass Creed a few years back when it as littered with glitches
[2017-06-17 20:57:22 UTC] jiv_: oooh ohh ohhh... nananana

[2017-06-17 21:06:29 UTC] stuart360: His first or second stream jimbob. It kept jumping up and down at like 200 views at once, so he obviously was being botted then

[2017-06-17 21:07:36 UTC] stuart360: Probably trolls to make Phil think he's doing better than he is or some shit like that, they pay for everything else so
[2017-06-17 21:07:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: really YaSlothy how come?
[2017-06-17 21:07:49 UTC] yaslothy: For some reason it feels better on controller while the original ME games felt better on keyboard and mouse.

[2017-06-17 21:09:21 UTC] yaslothy: @stuart360 I'm about 20 hours in. I'm probably the biggest ME fan here but I do recognize the game's faults and that's why I took some time off from the game. All the negativity was overwhelming as well, you're right.

He got 4th with it, but he kept insinuating he won because he was the highest ranking US player.

[2017-06-17 22:31:37 UTC] fudgepacker2000: @ziibrah they should've yeah, some banned the op character, but it wasnt enough imo. the point is that he's by no means the best SF player and no one is afraid of him like marsh says
[2017-06-17 22:31:42 UTC] tsrsnipez: now thats hes winning hes not saying anything
[2017-06-17 22:31:42 UTC] ohuken: he doesnt wanna go to evo

[2017-06-17 22:33:23 UTC] fudgepacker2000: @ziibrah not that impressive when he's using a character that was super OP because it was a glitched version of the game, and many other top players boycotted it
