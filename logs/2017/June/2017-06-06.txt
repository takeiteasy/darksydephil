[2017-06-06 02:01:35 UTC] deep_drive: thought it was cool akio
[2017-06-06 02:01:56 UTC] derichloveslemur: @akioartorius good. Phil won his 2nd tournament
[2017-06-06 02:02:17 UTC] akioartorius: Did Phil learn any other character defenses?
[2017-06-06 02:02:30 UTC] deep_drive: Phil mostly did tournament matches
[2017-06-06 02:02:53 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil did mostly Tournament yep
[2017-06-06 02:02:57 UTC] ornightz: Still feels surreal as if She's still alive even though she isin't
[2017-06-06 02:03:03 UTC] darksydephil: oh, i can't do more treasure battle
[2017-06-06 02:03:08 UTC] darksydephil: because it continues the streak, it didnt end
[2017-06-06 02:03:17 UTC] darksydephil: so it'd be like playing new characters against the much harder AI, i'd get stomped
[2017-06-06 02:03:18 UTC] derichloveslemur: It continues where you left off Phil?
[2017-06-06 02:03:41 UTC] deep_drive: oh wow didn't know it saved your progress
[2017-06-06 02:03:41 UTC] akioartorius: so you'll have to continue as Paul in treasure mode? you can't restart?
[2017-06-06 02:03:42 UTC] renastella: actually the streak is different with every character, as far as i know
[2017-06-06 02:03:44 UTC] derichloveslemur: Can't you restart?
[2017-06-06 02:03:51 UTC] darksydephil: it is??
[2017-06-06 02:03:55 UTC] derichloveslemur: I thought you could.
[2017-06-06 02:03:56 UTC] renastella: you start back at 0 wins with a new character
[2017-06-06 02:03:57 UTC] renastella: yeah
[2017-06-06 02:04:04 UTC] the_elusive_teal: rip
[2017-06-06 02:04:05 UTC] darksydephil: i was told the streak just runs endlessly until you lose no matter who you pick
[2017-06-06 02:04:16 UTC] akioartorius: try it
[2017-06-06 02:04:18 UTC] darksydephil: bc tonight i wanted to practice with bob/lili and tomorrow do MP with them
[2017-06-06 02:04:34 UTC] darksydephil: if i try it and it doesn't reset, i'm fucked, i'll lose my stream
[2017-06-06 02:04:35 UTC] darksydephil: streak
[2017-06-06 02:04:39 UTC] renastella: alright
[2017-06-06 02:04:53 UTC] ornightz: What do I fucking do now
[2017-06-06 02:04:59 UTC] bombjinlikesthed: Do you still get the rewards from 1-100?
[2017-06-06 02:05:13 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil you could try it.
[2017-06-06 02:05:18 UTC] darksydephil: yeah bc rewards are random except for the ones that are specific to your character
[2017-06-06 02:05:36 UTC] derichloveslemur: Yeah do the MP tomorrow sounds better.
[2017-06-06 02:05:39 UTC] akioartorius: You can't like select a new character and if it doesn't work back out?
[2017-06-06 02:05:57 UTC] darksydephil: if you quit mid-match it'd count as a loss i think
[2017-06-06 02:06:04 UTC] darksydephil: we can try it i guess lol
[2017-06-06 02:06:44 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, Sad perception got delayed tiL Wednesday that really sucked.
[2017-06-06 02:07:04 UTC] darksydephil: nah i tnever had a release date, which is what i kept saying but people kept telling me it did lol

[2017-06-06 02:07:31 UTC] darksydephil: im sure the match will be a speed up, double damage match against panda

[2017-06-06 02:57:29 UTC] kekon3: @darksydephil you want a launcher with a slight juggle that leads into a "spin move" (any move with green notation) this will lead to a special fall where you can OTG easier
[2017-06-06 02:57:32 UTC] pureo_nikku: damdai was fucking them up

[2017-06-06 03:35:27 UTC] akioartorius: is there another way for Phil to get better with Bob besides Tournament because I think People bring their A game during Tournaments?
[2017-06-06 03:35:37 UTC] kekon3: Claudio is well rounded, not as cheesy as a lot of characters

[2017-06-06 03:37:04 UTC] kinggoken: Crash trilogy was VERY good
[2017-06-06 03:37:05 UTC] akioartorius: I also wished Phil would read that comment about the aerial combos the one about the way the enemy spins so he can get the timing of his combos down.
[2017-06-06 03:37:13 UTC] optionalsuperboss: Lars.. coming for you peeps that download metallica songs

[2017-06-06 03:37:14 UTC] enzio814: Remember when Lars was a guess character in Naruto Ultimate Ninja??
[2017-06-06 03:37:21 UTC] kinggoken: the gameplay might feel a little dated now though

[2017-06-06 03:37:52 UTC] capitalist_pepe: Random Supa!!!
[2017-06-06 03:37:53 UTC] kekon3: @pureo_nikku like, instantly people picking Xiaoyu because a lot of her moves naturally avoid "highs" and shes fast, but players who space immediately crush that
[2017-06-06 03:37:58 UTC] patriotsfanx: Phil I think red hood is coming to injustice very soon he's in but grayed out
[2017-06-06 03:37:59 UTC] camero_56: i think your spacing is just off

[2017-06-06 03:38:04 UTC] vince329: @Scribbcrib are you connected to a modem?
[2017-06-06 03:38:08 UTC] pureo_nikku: idk people don't like to lose cheaply @Bloodsteel5432 they want to see the potential of the game

[2017-06-06 03:40:33 UTC] lemonplaysgames: "Speed and weight!" If only someone of Bob's size could realistically fight like that, lol.
[2017-06-06 03:40:35 UTC] rawxpain: So is this tounement thing like a mode that people can set up on here?
[2017-06-06 03:40:35 UTC] camero_56: Kekon3 what makes them easy though?

[2017-06-06 03:41:04 UTC] camero_56: LemonPlaysGames more realistically he'd just lose weight after like a month of doing it
[2017-06-06 03:41:05 UTC] akioartorius: Panda or Kuma? Roger is not in the game
[2017-06-06 03:41:07 UTC] kekon3: The technical characters have stances, their moves end in them entering a Special state for a few frames

[2017-06-06 03:42:09 UTC] weirdbutt: I think he only uses stick on SF

[2017-06-06 18:04:45 UTC] yaslothy: "Kiwami improved the resolution, framerate, textures and loading times compared to the original game, and additional content was added to resolve some of the more confusing plot points."
[2017-06-06 18:04:49 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the only thing with weeb games it that the steam cards sell for a high price hmmm
[2017-06-06 18:04:54 UTC] theycallmejimbob: is*
[2017-06-06 18:04:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: NotLikeThis

[2017-06-06 18:08:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no deep you can use steam cards to make badges on steam, usually the weeb ones are a high price

[2017-06-06 18:08:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: there are people who spent 1000's of dollars creating badges and have like 200 games
[2017-06-06 18:08:30 UTC] yaslothy: You're gonna see the real McCoy.
[2017-06-06 18:08:36 UTC] deep_drive: looks like visual novels mostly

[2017-06-06 18:19:07 UTC] popsicolo: I tried the WRONG emote. Fitting a five letter word in such a small space is tricky, and there's nothing else to fill the rest of the space with.
[2017-06-06 18:19:35 UTC] betheallen: welp
[2017-06-06 18:19:48 UTC] 1uke2000: not just america but politics in UK are crazy rn

[2017-06-06 18:20:22 UTC] popsicolo: Like, look at the dspNothing emote. Nothing fits and looks okay, but "I COULD DO" helps fill out the rest of the space
[2017-06-06 18:20:23 UTC] betheallen: well in the uk we are having a election so of course it is crazy lol
[2017-06-06 18:20:36 UTC] yaslothy: My heart goes out to you Britain.
