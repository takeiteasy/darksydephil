[2017-06-21 03:27:17 UTC] randomnamel4: The traps glow red...if you're stupid enough to walk over your own traps well...
[2017-06-21 03:27:18 UTC] iamtheluckyyo: yep
[2017-06-21 03:27:33 UTC] thearmettoast: it shows the icon on your UI when he can escape
[2017-06-21 03:27:37 UTC] khyrez_2097: trap door appears when theres one survivor left and they've turn on at least 2 gens..I think
[2017-06-21 03:27:38 UTC] flyeaglesfly01: @RandomNameL4 Why you raging about it lol
[2017-06-21 03:27:44 UTC] hugsnothooks: @akioartorius ah, then not for set traps.
[2017-06-21 03:27:45 UTC] paradogred: come home jason
[2017-06-21 03:27:53 UTC] sanguinenite: Phil got caught in his own trap twice already
[2017-06-21 03:28:18 UTC] randomnamel4: I'm not raging...just pointing out it's Phil's own stupidity
[2017-06-21 03:28:19 UTC] elzorrobot: man I would never take you bear hunting phil
[2017-06-21 03:28:21 UTC] whiit3shadow: welcome to my nightmare
[2017-06-21 03:28:28 UTC] akioartorius: @HugsNotHooks He can't see his own traps what? I thought he was a pro trapper. it was in his backstory
[2017-06-21 03:28:33 UTC] hugsnothooks: Yeah, unless someone uses a rare skeleton key for hatch. Then it could be earlier than just the last survivor

[2017-06-21 03:29:12 UTC] stuart360: Apart from the silly typical Phil stuff, he hasn't even been bad as the killer
[2017-06-21 03:29:15 UTC] yaslothy: sparky CAHMAN MAN!
[2017-06-21 03:29:25 UTC] dukaduka: trapper is probably the most practical killer and hag is probably the least practical

[2017-06-21 03:29:35 UTC] akioartorius: so does the last match count as a win for the killer or no? he did kill 3 out of the 4 people
[2017-06-21 03:29:41 UTC] yaslothy: Fuckin' sparky man

[2017-06-21 03:30:20 UTC] thearmettoast: @akioartorius no its based on performance to win. Phil lost, he didn't get 1 node to level up his rank
[2017-06-21 03:30:22 UTC] hugsnothooks: @akioartorius DBD is weird in that regard - you either pip (10k points), safety pip (7k) or depip (under 7k). Really the # of people you kill doesn't matter as much except for just killing people.
[2017-06-21 03:30:29 UTC] dukaduka: Phil play Nurse she's my favorite Kreygasm
[2017-06-21 03:30:40 UTC] thirdeyethethird: phil you got my pm on the forums?
[2017-06-21 03:30:48 UTC] hugsnothooks: So as survivor you can do enough to pip up in rank even though you don't escape
[2017-06-21 03:31:10 UTC] segaofmyhouse1: Doesn't every game do that?
[2017-06-21 03:31:15 UTC] iamtheluckyyo: it blows
[2017-06-21 03:31:17 UTC] young_wobblez: Well thats how leveling characters works..
[2017-06-21 03:31:21 UTC] segaofmyhouse1: ^

[2017-06-21 03:31:50 UTC] akioartorius: random question but who is the mystery 7th killer?
[2017-06-21 03:31:52 UTC] slurmdrinker: Best to put your traps in the grass, much harder to see
[2017-06-21 03:32:19 UTC] akioartorius: @Slurmdrinker and much easier to get caught in your own traps
[2017-06-21 03:32:25 UTC] thirdeyethethird: is it just me or is the frame rate tanking on the xbone
[2017-06-21 03:32:28 UTC] akioartorius: for Phil anyway
[2017-06-21 03:32:40 UTC] segaofmyhouse1: No wonder he's doing bad, frame drops Kappa
[2017-06-21 03:33:06 UTC] comfrtblynumb: what's this 15fps?
[2017-06-21 03:33:06 UTC] stuart360: The framerate is shot on PS4 as well, just look on Youtube to see. The Pro version runt upto 60fps though
[2017-06-21 03:33:10 UTC] dukaduka: @segaofmyhouse1 yup Kappa
[2017-06-21 03:33:15 UTC] hugsnothooks: should set a trap in the doorway there, not by the gen
[2017-06-21 03:33:22 UTC] rosshardie: Hideo Kojima had something to do with this Kappa
[2017-06-21 03:33:32 UTC] andreii1984: play this on xbone X because it powerful console which will run Destiny 2 at 30fps, lol

[2017-06-21 03:34:16 UTC] yaslothy: hook literally 3 feet away
[2017-06-21 03:34:18 UTC] kushiyakitori: did he even notice someone stepped in his trap?

[2017-06-21 03:35:17 UTC] dukaduka: @Whiit3ShaDow VR doesnt make a bad game better. It just makes it more expensive OpieOP
[2017-06-21 03:35:30 UTC] yaslothy: Steam Summer Sale amirite?
[2017-06-21 03:35:34 UTC] yaslothy: Even though no flash sales :(

[2017-06-21 03:35:39 UTC] elzorrobot: look at the stats phil they did
[2017-06-21 03:35:40 UTC] hugsnothooks: 1 did get caught, and they got freed
[2017-06-21 03:35:40 UTC] akioartorius: Getting kills is already doing better than first matches of F13
[2017-06-21 03:35:46 UTC] dukaduka: inb4 Phil is the first one to get caught in a trap LUL
[2017-06-21 03:35:47 UTC] whiit3shadow: fair point, but i wasnt trying to make the game better, maybe a bit more enjoyable tho

[2017-06-21 03:39:43 UTC] sanguinenite: looks like it
[2017-06-21 03:39:43 UTC] baseddrewtheking: Set the trap below the hook

[2017-06-21 03:40:11 UTC] hugsnothooks: @BasedDrewTheKing game doesn't allow it anymore because it messes with the keybinding
[2017-06-21 03:40:16 UTC] paradogred: guy get killed boring
[2017-06-21 03:40:19 UTC] hugsnothooks: and you'd try to unhook rather than undo the trap
[2017-06-21 03:40:20 UTC] sanguinenite: @dukaduka yeah and its is funny how the claw didnt go thru their heart
[2017-06-21 03:40:28 UTC] katexo234: rip to random guy
[2017-06-21 03:40:31 UTC] j0ne5: Phil, in waiting by the hook you are "camping" and this is considered unsportsmanlike on PC
[2017-06-21 03:40:49 UTC] dukaduka: hatch door is in play
[2017-06-21 03:40:51 UTC] god_revan_ryu: The trap door is by the garage @DarksydePhil
[2017-06-21 03:40:52 UTC] stuart360: There wass a survivor in the garage, i could see her
[2017-06-21 03:40:52 UTC] comfrtblynumb: I thought this game had an anti-camper system

[2017-06-21 03:41:04 UTC] paradogred: hunt more girls phil
[2017-06-21 03:41:05 UTC] j0ne5: not to say nobody camps on PC but you get flamed for it
[2017-06-21 03:41:06 UTC] hugsnothooks: and then you'll see it nearby
[2017-06-21 03:41:07 UTC] randomnamel4: hatch is around gas station i heard it
[2017-06-21 03:41:18 UTC] billtency: windy noise for the hatch

[2017-06-21 03:42:37 UTC] hugsnothooks: like you said phil, probably looking for hatch and sucks at finding it.

[2017-06-21 03:42:41 UTC] 0megaj0ker: set up more traps around the hatch

[2017-06-21 03:43:10 UTC] andreii1984: stay with hatch

[2017-06-21 03:54:04 UTC] deep_drive: @YaSlothy am i the only one around here who gives a shit about the rules
[2017-06-21 03:54:06 UTC] hugsnothooks: someone went and picked him up when you set your trap down
[2017-06-21 03:54:11 UTC] therealshakespeare: omg
[2017-06-21 03:54:24 UTC] therealshakespeare: of course he camps

[2017-06-21 03:55:50 UTC] electrogaming92: who knows maybe we'll see a mid gen switch refresh lol
[2017-06-21 03:55:57 UTC] akioartorius: Still doing better than F13 Phil

[2017-06-21 03:56:18 UTC] ludes420: its new to consoles so lol
[2017-06-21 03:56:20 UTC] chillwind700: Was myers omitted from the console version?

[2017-06-21 03:56:29 UTC] avilith: Yes

[2017-06-21 03:56:37 UTC] angelus72: What happened?
[2017-06-21 03:56:39 UTC] soccertom44: so an inferior later version is a premier?
[2017-06-21 03:56:49 UTC] goldencolts: good performance was omitted from the console version
[2017-06-21 03:56:51 UTC] akioartorius: @gxpopcorn69 I thought his first matches as Jason in Friday the 13th he didn't kill a lot of survivors
[2017-06-21 03:56:55 UTC] kozatof: Did I miss anything good
[2017-06-21 03:56:56 UTC] yaslothy: Will this game ever get out of early access?
[2017-06-21 03:57:00 UTC] evilhenchman: I think myers comes later as a dlc
[2017-06-21 03:57:05 UTC] kozatof: How many matches has he done
[2017-06-21 03:57:20 UTC] yaslothy: @kozatof three or four
[2017-06-21 03:57:22 UTC] deep_drive: you missed some epic fails kozatof
[2017-06-21 03:57:25 UTC] chillwind700: From what I've seen Soccer Bill was omitted, Laura was omitted, haddonfield was omitted and Myers was omitted
[2017-06-21 03:57:25 UTC] hugsnothooks: This is the 3rd as trapper I think
[2017-06-21 03:57:34 UTC] timetorage: Is he playing on ps4
[2017-06-21 03:57:35 UTC] akioartorius: so 4 matches?
[2017-06-21 03:57:41 UTC] yaslothy: idk for sure
[2017-06-21 03:57:41 UTC] kozatof: @deep_drive I saw him get trapped by his own trap
[2017-06-21 03:57:42 UTC] hugsnothooks: No bill... no borrowed time. Borrowed time salt would have been good
[2017-06-21 03:57:46 UTC] chillwind700: I'm assuming it's because of copyright
[2017-06-21 03:57:48 UTC] ludes420: xbox
[2017-06-21 03:57:48 UTC] suckasurprise: Phil seems pretty good at this game

[2017-06-21 03:58:12 UTC] chillwind700: What was that
[2017-06-21 03:58:14 UTC] elzorrobot: lol she clicked on the trap by accident I saw that
[2017-06-21 03:58:19 UTC] spazz3: Kreygasm
[2017-06-21 03:58:24 UTC] iamtheluckyyo: its over win
[2017-06-21 03:58:24 UTC] yaslothy: Here's the thing though...pornstars get tested monthly
[2017-06-21 03:58:24 UTC] jponk: OH
[2017-06-21 03:58:27 UTC] jponk: HE ACTUALLY NOTICED
[2017-06-21 03:58:28 UTC] yaslothy: not that I would know.
[2017-06-21 03:58:31 UTC] cinsolace92: good shit phil
[2017-06-21 03:58:34 UTC] carnifex321: traps can't be placed directly under feet, there is space enough for someone to save without being trapped
[2017-06-21 03:58:40 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @DarksydePhil the chick tried to interact the trap instead of the survivor
[2017-06-21 03:58:43 UTC] itsdraake: 1 2 3 its all over!!
[2017-06-21 03:58:46 UTC] deep_drive: good to see we have someone in the buisness here yaslothy
[2017-06-21 03:58:48 UTC] therealshakespeare: lol
[2017-06-21 03:58:49 UTC] carnifex321: you're better off putting them in the grass near a hooked survivor
[2017-06-21 03:58:49 UTC] stuart360: Phil is good at this game
[2017-06-21 03:58:53 UTC] cinsolace92: Beautiful killong Phil
[2017-06-21 03:58:54 UTC] sanguinenite: Being caught in the trap so many times phil finally noticed
[2017-06-21 03:58:55 UTC] akioartorius: still a victory though
[2017-06-21 03:58:55 UTC] chillwind700: Because people were salty over trapping hooks I'm assuming
[2017-06-21 03:58:55 UTC] timetorage: this the ps4 version?
[2017-06-21 03:59:02 UTC] spazz3: GG Phil SeemsGood

[2017-06-21 03:59:25 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Trapper going on a nice mid-night stroll :)
[2017-06-21 03:59:27 UTC] elzorrobot: working out well? :P
[2017-06-21 03:59:28 UTC] soccertom44: so he complains about cheap tactics until he uses them?
[2017-06-21 03:59:28 UTC] nobletwitchx: Why did you get less points?
[2017-06-21 03:59:28 UTC] timetorage: does it run good on consoles?
[2017-06-21 03:59:31 UTC] hugsnothooks: Until the same issue causes him to hit a survivor rather than pick them up, and the survivor crawls to a hatch
[2017-06-21 03:59:32 UTC] toshi_cl: clever girl
[2017-06-21 03:59:34 UTC] kozatof: YOURE WINNER
[2017-06-21 03:59:39 UTC] hugsnothooks: Then it's bad programming
[2017-06-21 03:59:43 UTC] chillwind700: Trapper is also a excellent way to earn BP I feel
[2017-06-21 03:59:45 UTC] akioartorius: @Elzorrobot Phil is using his own fail to adapt
[2017-06-21 03:59:47 UTC] grullstation: You should send that pro-tip to prima
[2017-06-21 03:59:51 UTC] stuart360: It runs ok on the Pro
[2017-06-21 03:59:54 UTC] grullstation: Im sure they would print it lol
[2017-06-21 03:59:58 UTC] deep_drive: ron jeremy got the free speech coalition award in 2009
[2017-06-21 04:00:06 UTC] spazz3: YOU'RE ALWAYS WINNER

[2017-06-21 04:00:15 UTC] deep_drive: got the positve image award
[2017-06-21 04:00:16 UTC] deep_drive: :D
[2017-06-21 04:00:22 UTC] elzorrobot: @akioartorius yes, but it wasn't his intention initially Kappa
[2017-06-21 04:00:28 UTC] timetorage: not sure if I should get this or Friday the 13th
[2017-06-21 04:00:28 UTC] chillwind700: Unnerving presence is on that web as well
[2017-06-21 04:00:30 UTC] evilhenchman: killer is a good way to learn the game cause you get to see what the survivors do that works
[2017-06-21 04:00:33 UTC] yaslothy: I saw Ron Jeremy in the flesh one time. PogChamp
[2017-06-21 04:00:38 UTC] kingsfan4: look for a game while you customize...
[2017-06-21 04:00:38 UTC] yaslothy: Ah, the hedgehog.
[2017-06-21 04:00:39 UTC] elzorrobot: that's the beauty of it
[2017-06-21 04:00:40 UTC] kushiyakitori: in case you are really good at a certain stage?
[2017-06-21 04:00:44 UTC] grullstation: This game way bette than F13th
[2017-06-21 04:00:52 UTC] popsicolo: What part of the flesh? @YaSlothy KappaHD
[2017-06-21 04:00:56 UTC] roadsamurai: your preference
[2017-06-21 04:01:06 UTC] chillwind700: Because you can potentially get shelter woods with that and shelter woods is the worst map for survivor
[2017-06-21 04:01:07 UTC] nobletwitchx: It's on sale on Steam, if anyone wants to buy it.
[2017-06-21 04:01:11 UTC] yaslothy: @Popsicolo RuleFive
[2017-06-21 04:01:16 UTC] angelus72: Idk, it's a funnier playthrough slightly, but F13 seems more fun imo

[2017-06-21 04:01:20 UTC] charizard545: 1 more wtf?
[2017-06-21 04:01:22 UTC] timetorage: I want to get it I just hope it runs okay on a regular PlayStation 4
[2017-06-21 04:01:31 UTC] electrogaming92: if theres no technology and you are only one chick which is healthy ugly chick or a hot pornstar chick with stds there is no "check" involved
[2017-06-21 04:01:33 UTC] elzorrobot: need more survivors
[2017-06-21 04:01:34 UTC] spazz3: Friday the 13th and Dead By Daylight Both great games Kappa
[2017-06-21 04:01:34 UTC] sanguinenite: the killers are so op even falling into your own trap isnt much of a nerf
[2017-06-21 04:01:37 UTC] therealshakespeare: ahhh to be an ignorant low rank
[2017-06-21 04:01:46 UTC] stuart360: It runs just the same on PS4, you need the Pro for a higher framerate
[2017-06-21 04:01:54 UTC] popsicolo: I just got done with my daily 10,000 steps. Time for a 1000 calorie smoothie TriHard
[2017-06-21 04:01:58 UTC] yaslothy: only 1 more match?

[2017-06-21 04:02:25 UTC] yaslothy: Kappa
[2017-06-21 04:02:31 UTC] avilith: Playing killer at rank 20 can make it seem op. Playing against Rank 1 survivors can be a nightmare, especially with SWF

[2017-06-21 18:22:40 UTC] yaslothy: When was the last time Phil was on time for a whole week?
[2017-06-21 18:23:21 UTC] sanguinenite: like almost never
[2017-06-21 18:23:24 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: I like how last night he started gameplay an hour late but finished normal time

[2017-06-21 18:23:55 UTC] taurusoxford: @hotsauceistoohot flawless strategy when your goal is for Twitch to become your new primary revenue source
[2017-06-21 18:24:21 UTC] xthewrath93x: DSP should be streaming all day
[2017-06-21 18:24:27 UTC] xthewrath93x: start at like 9 finish 7
[2017-06-21 18:24:29 UTC] xthewrath93x: if he wants to take it sreious

[2017-06-21 18:24:51 UTC] taurusoxford: You'd think he takes some lessons from Maximilian_dood, considering how successful he is
[2017-06-21 18:26:09 UTC] sanguinenite: Why does everyone compare him with Max just because he is a competitive street fighter player, how's that relevant to Phil now that he is clearly never going back?+
[2017-06-21 18:26:09 UTC] betheallen: sloth if i melt because its too hot you gotta look after my wife and baby ok

[2017-06-21 18:28:53 UTC] yaslothy: Isn't hosting automated?
[2017-06-21 18:28:57 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: If Phil is awake he's not tweeted about it. Still asleep I'd guess
[2017-06-21 18:29:05 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: and it is likely automatic, kekon3 is on his friend's list

[2017-06-21 18:50:34 UTC] yaslothy: He says
[2017-06-21 18:50:38 UTC] litterial: that was just unfortunate for Phil. If traps up the hatch again like that he will win more games than he loses
[2017-06-21 18:50:58 UTC] betheallen: good reason = he is scared to play dead by daylight again
[2017-06-21 18:51:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he was pretty successful as the killer
[2017-06-21 18:51:16 UTC] yaslothy: I'm guessing he cleaned his dust bin of a room.
[2017-06-21 18:51:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: what happened to star ocean 5 Kekon3
[2017-06-21 18:51:27 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: @BeTheAllen maybe true

[2017-06-21 18:58:13 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: unless Phil finds someone who is over 10 years younger than him, a new partner will likely be considering starting a family soon. Phil cannot afford this, so that may be a deal-breaker for any future girlfriend who is around Phil's age.
[2017-06-21 18:58:27 UTC] thedaftmouse: Oh god the idea of Phil being a fathee

[2017-06-21 19:04:27 UTC] errnoent: Phil is a person that has dealt with some psychological issues over the years and hasn't been afraid to show his true self online. Not 100% fixed all of those, but few of us have. He can also be funny as hell.
[2017-06-21 19:04:28 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: hmm
[2017-06-21 19:04:29 UTC] betheallen: im sorry
[2017-06-21 19:04:31 UTC] betheallen: :(
[2017-06-21 19:04:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he is being sponsored by V8 and is currently signing the contract philtheboss2367
[2017-06-21 19:04:45 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: usually I'm inclined to say a good reason for Phil would involve 'money'. This time I'm not sure. Perhaps he was up late talking to a lady online, and now has a new lady in his life.
[2017-06-21 19:04:48 UTC] yaslothy: one day I'm gonna have to use the ignore user function, and I don't want to..

[2017-06-21 19:05:32 UTC] philtheboss2367: 25 mins actually lol
[2017-06-21 19:05:45 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: @errnoent Phil, in my opinion, is unintentionally funny - when he is trying to be funny it's a bit meh, but he'll make you laugh about other shit without meaning to
[2017-06-21 19:05:54 UTC] errnoent: of course hotsauceistoohot
[2017-06-21 19:06:13 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: Phil:In Overwatch, communication is KEY.
[2017-06-21 19:06:19 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: even tho he doesnt do that
[2017-06-21 19:06:34 UTC] yaslothy: Of course Phil isn't intentionally funny..have you seen Project 7?

[2017-06-21 19:07:16 UTC] stuart360: Phil can be funny with some of the stuff he says. I find the salt and rage funnier though

[2017-06-21 19:07:46 UTC] stuart360: Why would YaSlothy get banned?
[2017-06-21 19:07:48 UTC] yaslothy: the funny shit from Phil that I found was with Rambo and console unboxings etc.
[2017-06-21 19:07:49 UTC] betheallen: project 7 = triggered
[2017-06-21 19:07:55 UTC] yaslothy: remember the xbox voice cammnd thing?
[2017-06-21 19:07:56 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: some people are 'naturally' funny. Phil isn't, in my opinion at least. - but humour is subjective, one person's comedy is another person's snorefest
[2017-06-21 19:08:14 UTC] yaslothy: command*
[2017-06-21 19:08:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Well I might be the only one but I can't wait for his DS2 SOTFS redemption run and Crash 3 playthrough
[2017-06-21 19:08:22 UTC] stuart360: He had great chemistry with Phil. I didn't even like watching co-op but i liked watching those two
[2017-06-21 19:08:31 UTC] yaslothy: true stuart
[2017-06-21 19:08:34 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: @YaSlothy yeah

[2017-06-21 19:09:34 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: Rambo, I feel, still is happy to try to make amends. Howard I feel got burned too hard and doesn't want any more to do. That's going by 'that' vid at least
[2017-06-21 19:09:37 UTC] errnoent: Phil is a different kind of humor than dunkey, though. He's (no offense Phil) a bit of a buffoon at times online, and it can be hilarious.
[2017-06-21 19:09:41 UTC] niruzi: Prob gonna be a Hex/Twinblade build lol

[2017-06-21 19:10:57 UTC] yaslothy: Rambo is god.
[2017-06-21 19:10:59 UTC] stuart360: Well he keeps calling it a Redemption Run so i think so. No dick lightning, no summons, no grinding
[2017-06-21 19:11:00 UTC] goldencolts: this is not dead by daylight
[2017-06-21 19:11:05 UTC] betheallen: jimbob the first dark souls 'redemption run' was a HUGE FAILURE

[2017-06-21 19:12:05 UTC] yaslothy: Gamestop prank calls Kreygasm
[2017-06-21 19:12:07 UTC] chrisbreezy00: phil beat bloodborne legit nothing there to redeem

[2017-06-21 19:12:11 UTC] stuart360: The only thing i have against Rambo and the others is why didn't they say something about all this before Phil left?. I mean he had the last meet uip with the guys, gave them a lot of stuff Phil wasn't taking with him, but they acted normal until Phil actually moved
[2017-06-21 19:12:28 UTC] electrumguy: who gives a fuck.

[2017-06-21 19:12:51 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: at least so they say
[2017-06-21 19:13:02 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Well watching the video it seems rambo and howard have a very old school mindset where they feel its his responsibility to talk to them instead of assuming everything is ok
[2017-06-21 19:13:02 UTC] goldencolts: phil gonna be on here in a minute his twitter says

[2017-06-21 19:13:28 UTC] yaslothy: @stuart360 Maybe they didn't want to mix shit up before he left...and it was only after Phil started reading shit in public that they had to make that podcast.
[2017-06-21 19:13:32 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: wonder what this good news could be....

[2017-06-21 19:21:06 UTC] litterial: but I don't like some of the direction it's going
[2017-06-21 19:21:09 UTC] chrisbreezy00: and they disrespected broly man
[2017-06-21 19:21:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the ominous PS4 dashboard music :(

[2017-06-21 19:21:41 UTC] kinggoken: best stream on TWITCH. Period.
[2017-06-21 19:21:50 UTC] 0megaj0ker: The Doctor killer sounds really complicated to play
[2017-06-21 19:21:53 UTC] jackwhite202: @chrisbreezy00 people asked for female SSJs for years
[2017-06-21 19:21:57 UTC] errnoent: let's go phil, time to commence the gab!!
[2017-06-21 19:22:10 UTC] stuart360: He said he's going to do both on last nights steam bethe. He really liked being a killer but the framerate sucks for some reason when being a killer
[2017-06-21 19:22:11 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Thats fine thats why they have PAn they dont need to bring Broly into this
[2017-06-21 19:22:11 UTC] chairmancaleb: @hotsauceistoohot, Being defensive of something would be like me defending an act of someone or defending my opinion about a show that I like that someone else may not like. You guys are talking like a bunch of kids about why people aren't friends anymore and I gave my own personal opinion about it. Nothing defensive about that...
[2017-06-21 19:22:15 UTC] sanguinenite: hyped for the night stream

[2017-06-21 19:23:16 UTC] 6th_moral: Anyone else here really miss Rhodesia?
[2017-06-21 19:23:16 UTC] stuart360: Phil is really good as the killer bethe, that could be a bad choice
[2017-06-21 19:23:17 UTC] xsithandrax: Hello!
[2017-06-21 19:23:20 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil did well as the killer BeTheAllen till the game jipped him and he picked up the trap instead of the survivor :(
[2017-06-21 19:23:22 UTC] sanguinenite: Xbone sucks for not having a calming music
[2017-06-21 19:23:22 UTC] xthewrath93x: grab drinks luuul
[2017-06-21 19:23:23 UTC] chairmancaleb: @errnoent, Welcome to the internet where people can have open discussions? Tell hot sauce to quit being ignorant and maybe it would have dropped long ago.
[2017-06-21 19:23:26 UTC] imaidenr: Phil im your biggest fan

[2017-06-21 19:24:17 UTC] jackwhite202: so is dead by daylight worth it?
[2017-06-21 19:24:22 UTC] leokira997: oi

[2017-06-21 19:24:35 UTC] jackwhite202: is it worth buying right now?
[2017-06-21 19:24:36 UTC] stuart360: There was some funny salt from Phil last night, he kept walking into bear traps that HE had put down lol
[2017-06-21 19:24:51 UTC] errnoent: ChairmanCaleb imagine yourself sitting next to this person at a bar, 3 beers deep. Would you still give a fuck about this "conversation"?
[2017-06-21 19:24:58 UTC] yaslothy: Spotify free trial ends soon TearGlove
[2017-06-21 19:24:59 UTC] chairmancaleb: Dead by Daylight is 10 dollars cheaper than Friday the 13th and plays a little bit better from what I've seen. I'd say if you want to choose between the two, go with Dead.
[2017-06-21 19:25:01 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: @stuart360 i saw the videos. was great
[2017-06-21 19:25:01 UTC] yaslothy: back to Apple Music
[2017-06-21 19:25:02 UTC] jackwhite202: @bakedessert i heard the game is dead on pc
[2017-06-21 19:25:04 UTC] betheallen: stuart you know how you solve that problem
[2017-06-21 19:25:04 UTC] comfrtblynumb: it's worth to buy for PC but not for consoles
[2017-06-21 19:25:08 UTC] betheallen: dont play as trapper
[2017-06-21 19:25:22 UTC] chairmancaleb: @errnoent, Again, welcome to the internet where every discussion is basically pointless at the end of the day FailFish
[2017-06-21 19:25:23 UTC] jackwhite202: @ChairmanCaleb thanks
[2017-06-21 19:25:25 UTC] stuart360: yep bethe, it was funny though
[2017-06-21 19:25:28 UTC] 6th_moral: Play the nurse, to be honest.

[2017-06-21 19:25:46 UTC] pcgamehunter: Oh lord not this game again FailFish
[2017-06-21 19:25:47 UTC] errnoent: ChairmanCaleb it is indeed a far cry from what it used to be
[2017-06-21 19:25:48 UTC] betheallen: yep delta

[2017-06-21 19:25:57 UTC] elijah_baldwin: @danielsvenson1 same
[2017-06-21 19:26:03 UTC] danielsvenson1: video is muted for me
[2017-06-21 19:26:04 UTC] jackwhite202: you know what would be cool? if this game had a campaign
[2017-06-21 19:26:05 UTC] chairmancaleb: @errnoent, BloodTrail

[2017-06-21 19:26:14 UTC] pcgamehunter: Hey jimbob, bethe, errnoent, cherdy
[2017-06-21 19:26:16 UTC] betheallen: sloth but its dark as fuck and if you are chasing a victim then you usually dont look where you are going
[2017-06-21 19:26:17 UTC] yaslothy: @theycallmejimbob the interface is so much more sleek.

[2017-06-21 19:26:39 UTC] stuart360: Phil also laid a trap of bear traps arong the floor hatch and the last survivor went for the hatch, got caught in a trap, Phil knocked them down, went to pick them uip but opened the hatch by mistake and the survivor escaped lol
[2017-06-21 19:26:58 UTC] jackwhite202: did a do a good choice by selling my xbox one and wii U?

[2017-06-21 19:27:33 UTC] chairmancaleb: @jackwhite202 That's up to you. IF you enjoy Nintendo games a lot, then maybe no. If you're going PC gaming, then ditching the xbone was a great choice.
[2017-06-21 19:27:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey DocMaximus
[2017-06-21 19:27:36 UTC] danielsvenson1: is leatherface in this game?

[2017-06-21 19:28:34 UTC] kekon3: VoHiYo I'm ready for stream today

[2017-06-21 22:22:29 UTC] mrpapaveraceae: Engines and motors are interchangeable. A generator is still a motor at it's core. Differences of motors and engines have different roles.

[2017-06-21 22:29:00 UTC] stuart360: If you like spending 90% of the match searching through draws and cupboards then FT13 is your game

[2017-06-21 22:30:11 UTC] shinaolord: that perk is beast
[2017-06-21 22:30:13 UTC] stuart360: Phil was pretty good as the killer as well.
[2017-06-21 22:30:13 UTC] shinaolord: get it
[2017-06-21 22:30:16 UTC] 0megaj0ker: They need to fix the frame rate for the Killer

[2017-06-21 22:30:19 UTC] sonicsergey: mix it up between the killer and survivor
[2017-06-21 22:30:23 UTC] betheallen: ITS NO USE
[2017-06-21 22:30:23 UTC] chillwind700: @darksydephil have you seen the omitted killer that's on pic but not on console yet?
[2017-06-21 22:30:35 UTC] g4s_pharaoh: cheer50 survivor is more entertaining imo as well so its good

[2017-06-21 22:30:38 UTC] sonicsergey: at least 1 or 2 matches with killer

[2017-06-21 22:30:44 UTC] stuart360: Yeah it makes no sense why the framerate is lower when you play as the killer
[2017-06-21 22:30:47 UTC] evanmeister12: do u know what level it is until you unlock more clother

[2017-06-21 22:31:24 UTC] zaxbys_sauce: His name is The Shape not Michael Myers
[2017-06-21 22:31:30 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Michael Myers is called the Shape
[2017-06-21 22:31:32 UTC] stuart360: We don't get Phil walking into his own bear traps though when he's a survivor
[2017-06-21 22:31:33 UTC] avocado_b: the most intense thing is when you open the exit and escape as the killer is running to stop you
[2017-06-21 22:31:38 UTC] chillwind700: When you prestige you get bloody clothing
[2017-06-21 22:32:27 UTC] stuart360: I hope you decide to play tomorrow as well Phil
