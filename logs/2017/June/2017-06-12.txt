[2017-06-12 17:28:46 UTC] sanguinenite: yeah I know phils sick again
[2017-06-12 17:32:15 UTC] hideokojim: If he cleaned his damn office he wouldn't always be sick.
[2017-06-12 17:33:15 UTC] sanguinenite: i dont think dust causes insomnia tho...
[2017-06-12 17:34:08 UTC] hideokojim: It can if he's congested and snotty because of his dusty play area.
[2017-06-12 17:34:52 UTC] hideokojim: I have the same problem. I run two air purifiers in my bedroom. It helps a great deal.
[2017-06-12 17:36:15 UTC] sanguinenite: wow 2 air purifiers? then again in the west, I guess you guys need it with all the chemtrails. Maybe phil should get one. I am happy that I am healthy enough that I am not congested except when I get the flue.
[2017-06-12 17:37:40 UTC] hideokojim: I'm on the east coast. The pollen count has been really high this year. Probably from all the rain.
[2017-06-12 17:38:41 UTC] sanguinenite: I think people who have good health are unaffected by pollen levels

[2017-06-12 17:47:05 UTC] misterdragin: now it's PUBG time. it's so funny.. one of the most popular games on twicth.. even by accident and you will still see it if you use twitch
[2017-06-12 17:47:14 UTC] misterdragin: phil: never heard of it, what is this
[2017-06-12 17:47:20 UTC] misterdragin: and he's a streamer
[2017-06-12 17:48:20 UTC] misterdragin: that being said, I don't like it. and all of these H1Z1 games

[2017-06-12 17:48:27 UTC] misterdragin: fuckem
[2017-06-12 17:48:56 UTC] sanguinenite: I never heard of it either but given how phil's a gamer, he should know but he probably doesnt XD
[2017-06-12 17:49:21 UTC] misterdragin: to be fair, it's a pc game.. but still. it's everywhere
[2017-06-12 17:49:36 UTC] sanguinenite: lol phil almost never plays games on pc
[2017-06-12 17:49:52 UTC] misterdragin: I know
[2017-06-12 17:50:39 UTC] sanguinenite: I hope sony comes in to save this years e3 from how boring it has been so far.
[2017-06-12 17:51:12 UTC] hideokojim: I hope there's info on Death Stranding.
[2017-06-12 17:51:19 UTC] misterdragin: they saved it last year
[2017-06-12 17:51:24 UTC] misterdragin: we'll see
[2017-06-12 17:52:00 UTC] misterdragin: they hyped sony VR and it fell flat.. but they had games. non stop games, exactly what people want
[2017-06-12 17:53:05 UTC] hideokojim: Yeah, Microsoft really dropped the ball this year as far as releases go.
[2017-06-12 17:53:39 UTC] sanguinenite: they announced a lot of games, a lot of games no one really gave a crap about and didnt look all that good
[2017-06-12 17:53:46 UTC] misterdragin: I heard bethesda conf sucked except for wolfenstein and 1 othe rgame
[2017-06-12 17:53:55 UTC] misterdragin: other*
[2017-06-12 17:54:02 UTC] sanguinenite: they had an ultra short press conference
[2017-06-12 17:54:19 UTC] sanguinenite: honestly, I feel bad for people that went out of their way to be there in person to be honest
[2017-06-12 17:54:40 UTC] sanguinenite: At least I appreciate how they didnt waste my time with fluff like MS
[2017-06-12 17:54:47 UTC] misterdragin: II'll watch phil's coverage
[2017-06-12 17:55:09 UTC] misterdragin: I guess most are sent by sponsors and stuff

[2017-06-12 17:55:36 UTC] misterdragin: why not
[2017-06-12 17:56:07 UTC] sanguinenite: oh are you talking about the hired audience?
[2017-06-12 17:56:12 UTC] betheallen: pc games exclusives usually suck no offense
[2017-06-12 17:56:47 UTC] sanguinenite: true, pc games are for game developers who cannot afford it to port it to console, which most hardcore gamers are at
[2017-06-12 17:56:48 UTC] misterdragin: not hired
[2017-06-12 17:57:06 UTC] misterdragin: phil went to e3 when he was with machinima for example
[2017-06-12 17:57:07 UTC] deep_drive: The intel press conference was dumb
[2017-06-12 17:57:21 UTC] betheallen: i say bethesda had a solid press conference short and announced good games, if it wasnt for vr shit it would be a 10/10 conferece but it got knocked to a 8/10

[2017-06-12 18:00:27 UTC] danielsvenson1: is phil streaming today?
[2017-06-12 18:00:32 UTC] misterdragin: you're treating pc as an equal of consoles, with its own exclusives. it's a totally different beast
