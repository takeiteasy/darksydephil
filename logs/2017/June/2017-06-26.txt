[2017-06-26 18:55:26 UTC] chairmancaleb: The left didn't even know how to handle it, they were as shocked as the rest.
[2017-06-26 18:55:47 UTC] errnoent: for 2005 alone..
[2017-06-26 18:55:59 UTC] chairmancaleb: @errnoent, Yes? Why would he stop paying taxes?
[2017-06-26 18:56:13 UTC] chairmancaleb: The left was even continulously saying he avoided taxes for 20 years...
[2017-06-26 18:56:14 UTC] chairmancaleb: lmao
[2017-06-26 18:56:42 UTC] errnoent: it's nice when you can cherry pick things that look good

[2017-06-26 18:57:18 UTC] chairmancaleb: He's under investigation for bank fraud, that's what's happening.
[2017-06-26 18:57:20 UTC] errnoent: :D
[2017-06-26 18:57:37 UTC] chairmancaleb: @errnoent Again, why would he stopp aying taxes after 2005 with no evidence to back it up?
[2017-06-26 18:58:17 UTC] chairmancaleb: If you can't answer that, then we're clearly done.

[2017-06-26 18:59:18 UTC] errnoent: and you realize how long ago 2005 was, right?
[2017-06-26 18:59:32 UTC] chairmancaleb: @errnoent That has nothing to do with what we're talking about sir? You're on the assumption that he stopped doing his taxes after 2005.
[2017-06-26 18:59:37 UTC] chairmancaleb: That's what you're insinuating.
[2017-06-26 18:59:43 UTC] errnoent: I am not on that assumption, nor am I insinuating that

[2017-06-26 18:59:53 UTC] sanguinenite: Today is a good stream day. Hilary avoided taxes and used the same loopholes that Trump used so the left's accusations are useless xD
[2017-06-26 18:59:55 UTC] chairmancaleb: It's clear that you are.
[2017-06-26 19:00:01 UTC] errnoent: No, I'm not. Please paste where I said that
[2017-06-26 19:00:22 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Hilary avoids taxes? cant say im surprised
[2017-06-26 19:00:31 UTC] chairmancaleb: "And you realize how long ago 2005 was right? For 2005 alone...."

[2017-06-26 19:01:26 UTC] errnoent: ChairmanCaleb My pointing out that he only released 2005 taxes, does not imply that he has not done his taxes any of the other years.

[2017-06-26 19:03:40 UTC] chairmancaleb: @errnoent, So, does our president need to realase every single year of his tax returns to make you fele better?
[2017-06-26 19:03:42 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: I don't think they made any real ruling, they mentioned something about October

[2017-06-26 19:29:06 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Malphite is primarliy a tank and shouldn't be able to win against yasuo so my advice there is to not take fights and just farm up, while fiddlesticks is actually a jungle champion and is not very good in lane

[2017-06-26 19:34:31 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: @CressTheAngel its better than RDR in my opinion
[2017-06-26 19:34:36 UTC] thabeardedblarg: @KingJezal any normal Youtuber would stagger the uploads, hell even 5 a day would gain more traction that uploading 40 like he did a few days ago. It was mad overwhelming...
[2017-06-26 19:34:46 UTC] bboypsyklone: @mfd4419 what did you preorder?
[2017-06-26 19:34:55 UTC] cresstheangel: yeah i suppose TNFoC
[2017-06-26 19:35:01 UTC] derpie12: Tfw the XCOM dev would be willling to do a crossover with Nintendo if they said yes...
[2017-06-26 19:35:02 UTC] mfd4419: Crash @bboypsyklone
[2017-06-26 19:35:03 UTC] shemp89: He's gotta pay bills though,
[2017-06-26 19:35:15 UTC] kingjezal: @ThaBeardedBlarg You don't have to watch them if they're overwhelming. This is a business.
[2017-06-26 19:35:18 UTC] bboypsyklone: oh i thought you meant the SuperNes Mini
[2017-06-26 19:35:34 UTC] unoriginaldavid: Yup Phil is omnipresent in my yt feed lol that's alright though
[2017-06-26 19:35:35 UTC] thabeardedblarg: Today I learned that begging for money is a business LUL
[2017-06-26 19:35:35 UTC] niruzi: Sup guys
[2017-06-26 19:35:37 UTC] sanguinenite: @ThaBeardedBlarg lol Phil not like other youtubers xD there is a thing called a stop button if people cannot stop themselves its their own problem xD
[2017-06-26 19:35:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey niruzi
[2017-06-26 19:35:45 UTC] chrisbreezy00: i dont understand that argument that he uploads so much nobody is forcing you to watch every video lol
[2017-06-26 19:35:45 UTC] eternia_forever: i always am in very good spirits my friend thanks for asking, and i hope you are in tip top shape bud on this blessed day . @theycallmejimbob
[2017-06-26 19:35:55 UTC] shemp89: Lol
[2017-06-26 19:36:08 UTC] unoriginaldavid: sup @niruzi HeyGuys
[2017-06-26 19:36:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I'm good thanks eternia_forever looking forward to a fuuuun stream of DBD
[2017-06-26 19:36:11 UTC] niruzi: I was afraid I missed the stream. lol
[2017-06-26 19:36:17 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: that's a very protracted way of just going 'sound, pal'
[2017-06-26 19:36:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey unoriginaldavid how the heck are you
[2017-06-26 19:36:28 UTC] leonaras: @Darksydephil Would you be consdering an ori 2 playthrough? And if so would you take a look back at the original first? its only about 9-12 hours long generally and its an amazing game.
[2017-06-26 19:36:33 UTC] sanguinenite: lol phils usually late so its unlikely you miss anything xD
[2017-06-26 19:36:39 UTC] jackwhite202: @chrisbreezy00 in LOL which division are you in?
[2017-06-26 19:36:43 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Leon he thought the first Ori was boring as shit
[2017-06-26 19:36:45 UTC] kingjezal: @ThaBeardedBlarg What Phil does is not begging. Requesting support in return for massive quantities of quality content is nothing resembling begging.
[2017-06-26 19:36:45 UTC] eternia_forever: yeah this one should be very good @theycallmejimbob
[2017-06-26 19:36:47 UTC] errnoent: chrisbreezy00 it makes the channel less appealing imo
[2017-06-26 19:36:52 UTC] unoriginaldavid: @theycallmejimbob allergies are killing me today but everything's good apart from that, how's you sir
[2017-06-26 19:36:55 UTC] iazy333: on break or late as usual?
[2017-06-26 19:36:59 UTC] thabeardedblarg: @KingJezal SeemsGood
[2017-06-26 19:37:02 UTC] gamemaster2003isdead: Hello,how is everyone today
[2017-06-26 19:37:05 UTC] rissingrstr: What I find funny is how Phil used to hate on Twitch and now he is worse than most other Twitch streamers with the begging. LUL
[2017-06-26 19:37:12 UTC] eternia_forever: well said @KingJezal
[2017-06-26 19:37:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I don't think he was that hyped by the announcement of ORI 2 Leonaras although I liked the original ORI too
[2017-06-26 19:37:20 UTC] thabeardedblarg: Exactly
[2017-06-26 19:37:22 UTC] chrisbreezy00: i mean lets be honest phils reputation is already shot to the ground so now hes kinda forced to spam videos
[2017-06-26 19:37:27 UTC] chrisbreezy00: He doesnt really have a choice
[2017-06-26 19:37:32 UTC] sanguinenite: phil did it reluctantly so he doesnt see himself as a sellout ,at least that seems to be whats happening
[2017-06-26 19:37:34 UTC] shemp89: Money is phils business and business is good.
[2017-06-26 19:37:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I'm good thanks unoriginaldavid hope your allergies clear up soon
[2017-06-26 19:38:02 UTC] xthewrath93x: ya i mean if dsp uploaded 1 video a day, would it even crack 10k views? who knows
[2017-06-26 19:38:11 UTC] bboypsyklone: who here is arguing about Phil? if you are upset with him, then why the hell are you on his stream?
[2017-06-26 19:38:23 UTC] thabeardedblarg: What happened to the glory days before he tarnished his rep. We want that back, not a video spamming person...
[2017-06-26 19:38:25 UTC] chairmancaleb: FUNgineer
[2017-06-26 19:38:26 UTC] eternia_forever: i was watching the friday the 13th video on youtube last evening where you left the 5000 bit cheers, very nice @KingJezal
[2017-06-26 19:38:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no ominous PS4 dashboard music :(
[2017-06-26 19:38:30 UTC] unoriginaldavid: @theycallmejimbob thanks man usually they go away around September so that's good
[2017-06-26 19:38:30 UTC] themilkman42: The impending salt mine lol
[2017-06-26 19:38:32 UTC] sanguinenite: They are obviously trolls trying to give rational arguments but failing @bboypsyklone
[2017-06-26 19:38:40 UTC] jackwhite202: @chrisbreezy00 in LOL are you ranked?
[2017-06-26 19:38:42 UTC] darksydephil: hate to break it to my critics, but my streams are still very much about gameplay and not constant shilling, if you haven't noticed. just more interactive now, so to say im "worse than the rest of twitch" just makes you look like a fucking jackass lol
[2017-06-26 19:38:49 UTC] aanukanaka: It's all about time and revenue -LTG Scholar, Philosopher

[2017-06-26 19:39:12 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: LTG is the perfect human
[2017-06-26 19:39:14 UTC] kushiyakitori: I was out of town a couple days. What happened with Atlus? Did the false strike become removed?
[2017-06-26 19:39:16 UTC] coralguy: I enjoy how phil streams now very much
[2017-06-26 19:39:18 UTC] bombjinlikesthed: Starting off the stream with some ranting
[2017-06-26 19:39:23 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Jack i was Diamond 5 last season but i havent played ranked this season yet
[2017-06-26 19:39:30 UTC] gamemaster2003isdead: Phil are you ever going to play mega man 7-9
[2017-06-26 19:39:30 UTC] kingjezal: @eternia_forever I remember that. That was rough stream.
[2017-06-26 19:39:33 UTC] unoriginaldavid: @theycallmejimbob I hope so too but it's the same every year so I'm not counting on it lol
[2017-06-26 19:39:37 UTC] aanukanaka: Dale truly enlightened
[2017-06-26 19:39:38 UTC] chrisbreezy00: LTG is the vegeta to Phils Goku
[2017-06-26 19:39:43 UTC] darksydephil: CressTheAngel its getting better but still not there yet. im thinking danganronpa 2 resumes tomorrow just to be on the safe side
[2017-06-26 19:39:51 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: still quiet for me
[2017-06-26 19:39:53 UTC] bobbi_ling: TBCrunchy
[2017-06-26 19:39:53 UTC] sanguinenite: ugh
[2017-06-26 19:39:57 UTC] thabeardedblarg: No offense at all Phil, and I will most likely get timed out for this, but your reputation precedes you. Whether or not it is your fault is your business. But I do miss content from before.
[2017-06-26 19:40:01 UTC] jackwhite202: @chrisbreezy00 diamond thats really good
[2017-06-26 19:40:13 UTC] cresstheangel: alright, thanks for the update tho phil
[2017-06-26 19:40:19 UTC] jackwhite202: @chrisbreezy00 im level 15 so im currently unranked
[2017-06-26 19:40:29 UTC] jakxzero: Phil when are will you do another Indie marathon. those are my absolutely fav playthroughs
[2017-06-26 19:40:30 UTC] chrisbreezy00: i mean its not like phil can do anything about it now
[2017-06-26 19:40:31 UTC] errnoent: OTOH what's done is done, what can he really do about it at this point?
[2017-06-26 19:40:33 UTC] darksydephil: its a reputation based on slander and jealousy ThaBeardedBlarg and one i very much didn't create nor perpetuate. so not much i could do about it
[2017-06-26 19:40:59 UTC] chrisbreezy00: i mean either way its not like you can absolve it now
[2017-06-26 19:41:10 UTC] darksydephil: nope
[2017-06-26 19:41:14 UTC] eternia_forever: yeah dem trolls @KingJezal but that was a very nice offering on your end and yeah that trolls voice lmao " Thats the Guy " lol

[2017-06-26 19:41:21 UTC] theycallmejimbob: beeps even
[2017-06-26 19:41:23 UTC] darksydephil: its about ignoring the brainless sheep who constantly beat the dead horse and moving forward positively
[2017-06-26 19:41:24 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Honestly do you regret playing metal gear i mean that was the start
[2017-06-26 19:41:26 UTC] absolso: floe127 floe127 floe127
[2017-06-26 19:41:27 UTC] darksydephil: and thats what im doing
[2017-06-26 19:41:27 UTC] euffy: There was a beep
[2017-06-26 19:41:28 UTC] thabeardedblarg: I just hate seeing 80+ emails from your uploads... :/ I wish it didn't come to spamming vids
[2017-06-26 19:41:38 UTC] jackwhite202: @chrisbreezy00 do you know when this current season is gonna end?
[2017-06-26 19:41:39 UTC] coralguy: How bout that airline food.....
[2017-06-26 19:41:41 UTC] chillwind700: Honestly Phil I do miss back in 2009 when I first found you because there wasn't any sort of drama around you. Probably the "worst" thing you did was call out ODST from being a 60 dollar dlc
[2017-06-26 19:41:43 UTC] chrisbreezy00: no
[2017-06-26 19:41:49 UTC] sanguinenite: no @ThaBeardedBlarg it is not the subjects responsibility to keep other busybodies from talking about them.
[2017-06-26 19:41:50 UTC] darksydephil: maybe you should disable the emails that you chose to manually enable yourself? LOL you blame me for that?
[2017-06-26 19:41:51 UTC] bobbi_ling: i dont get emails
[2017-06-26 19:41:57 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :D what about that airline food coralguy

[2017-06-26 19:42:01 UTC] chrisbreezy00: they email you wtf
[2017-06-26 19:42:02 UTC] kingjezal: @eternia_forever Thanks. Fortunately Phil got that stuff under control for that game.
[2017-06-26 19:42:04 UTC] aanukanaka: Positivity is key
[2017-06-26 19:42:04 UTC] cresstheangel: me either, i don't get emails from YT
[2017-06-26 19:42:06 UTC] errnoent: and Phil I think the reputation he's referring to is more or less the old days when you became very angry and did ... painful things to your controller on camera lol
[2017-06-26 19:42:07 UTC] bobbi_ling: oi jim
[2017-06-26 19:42:13 UTC] unoriginaldavid: @thabeardedblarg just disable notifications and check his channel whenever

[2017-06-26 19:42:32 UTC] thabeardedblarg: Yet no other youtubers upload as much as you do. Just playing devil's advocate
[2017-06-26 19:42:32 UTC] sanguinenite: some people are too stupid to disable notifications via email, like the trolls xD
[2017-06-26 19:42:34 UTC] chrisbreezy00: I remember in the 2009 2010 days people would accuse him of being a AVGN rip off
[2017-06-26 19:42:36 UTC] bboypsyklone: oh god that scared me
[2017-06-26 19:42:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: from yesterday BeTheAllen NotLikeThis ?

[2017-06-26 19:43:24 UTC] coralguy: Phil If I were any more excited I'd be dead
[2017-06-26 19:43:35 UTC] litterial: @ThaBeardedBlarg there's no point to have notifications enabled for Phil's gaming channel. He always uploads.
[2017-06-26 19:43:38 UTC] absolso: @DarksydePhil Can you dab on stream again?
[2017-06-26 19:43:40 UTC] weiland: superiorly simple

[2017-06-26 19:49:12 UTC] ericeericson: Phil won't stop. He needs Twitch income and youtube income and base his viewership on the same audience size. No time to edit/higher quality

[2017-06-26 21:27:36 UTC] g4s_pharaoh: FUCKING NUDNIK
[2017-06-26 21:27:40 UTC] shinaolord: @bigHOSSX no but there are still some problems in DBD
[2017-06-26 21:27:42 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: Ready up or die by the blade
[2017-06-26 21:27:42 UTC] timic83: why does every game have these stupid queues... what happened to server browsers

[2017-06-26 21:27:46 UTC] niruzi: does this game have in game voice chat?
[2017-06-26 21:28:01 UTC] shinaolord: @Niruzi Negatie.

[2017-06-26 21:28:09 UTC] eternia_forever: damm i have alot of games to buy to fill holes in my collection that i just decided i want to get to work on @theycallmejimbob
[2017-06-26 21:28:09 UTC] goldencolts: all you do is fix generators in this
[2017-06-26 21:28:10 UTC] xthewrath93x: hey @Popsicolo
[2017-06-26 21:28:11 UTC] neilfallonsbeard: More variety? Don't you just piss about fixing a generator?
[2017-06-26 21:28:13 UTC] insidiouslyy: This games been out way longer
[2017-06-26 21:28:15 UTC] killer_bheaze: both are terrible
[2017-06-26 21:28:16 UTC] dukexjt: But its got cha cha cha
[2017-06-26 21:28:18 UTC] divanerasmus: Friday 13th is broken
[2017-06-26 21:28:19 UTC] kushiyakitori: they probably mean the ways to escape
[2017-06-26 21:28:21 UTC] goldencolts: and and all the killer does is chase people and put them on the hook
[2017-06-26 21:28:26 UTC] goldencolts: F13 has chases and special kills
[2017-06-26 21:28:26 UTC] bobbi_ling: someone mentioned f13 better booty MingLee
[2017-06-26 21:28:27 UTC] beholderchil: fridey the 13 hs more fanboys
[2017-06-26 21:28:28 UTC] popsicolo: Ay
[2017-06-26 21:28:31 UTC] sanguinenite: FT13 is better because you can wait it out and beat it as a survivor
[2017-06-26 21:28:32 UTC] divanerasmus: Frames are broken
[2017-06-26 21:28:34 UTC] rikytikytavi: Phil, don't forget that there is coming free DLC to DBD with 1 free killer and 1 free survivor
[2017-06-26 21:28:35 UTC] stuart360: If FT13 was better, how come it has half the daily playerbase on Steam, even though FT13 is a much newer game
[2017-06-26 21:28:38 UTC] shinaolord: So Does this game @Goldencolts
[2017-06-26 21:28:38 UTC] divanerasmus: all is broken
[2017-06-26 21:28:39 UTC] insidiouslyy: You can actually murder people in f13
[2017-06-26 21:28:39 UTC] beholderchil: in reality they are both average games
[2017-06-26 21:28:44 UTC] cresstheangel: i think both games are garbage tbh xD
[2017-06-26 21:28:44 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you're collecting PS2 games eternia_forever ?
[2017-06-26 21:28:46 UTC] dark_stalkers95: That's your opinion though and F13 has way more kill scenarios
[2017-06-26 21:28:46 UTC] infiltrationz: Friday the 13th got boring
[2017-06-26 21:28:47 UTC] yaslothy: so basically both are mediocre
[2017-06-26 21:28:48 UTC] yaslothy: gg
[2017-06-26 21:28:49 UTC] goldencolts: you can fight jason!

[2017-06-26 21:28:56 UTC] shinaolord: You can kill survs in DBD w/o hooking
[2017-06-26 21:28:57 UTC] sanguinenite: both are games indeed
[2017-06-26 21:29:02 UTC] neilfallonsbeard: They both seems wasted opportunities in truth.
[2017-06-26 21:29:03 UTC] insidiouslyy: You gotta know how to fight him
[2017-06-26 21:29:05 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: Could they at least add sexier generators?

[2017-06-26 21:29:25 UTC] beanie5181: Ft13 was a fetish simulator tbh
[2017-06-26 21:29:28 UTC] eternia_forever: ps3 ps4 xbox 360 og xbox @theycallmejimbob
[2017-06-26 21:29:30 UTC] blk_mage_ctype: cheer10 While Dead By Daylight is the better game overall, I really wish that it had Friday the 13th stun mechanics and multiple escape options. Dead By Daylight seems to favor the Killer a bit too much, especially if he camps.
[2017-06-26 21:29:33 UTC] yaslothy: Sure I did. OpieOP

[2017-06-26 21:31:51 UTC] ericeericson: i think you need 3 generators to open the hatch

[2017-06-26 21:32:58 UTC] rikytikytavi: Phil, the magical number of hatch is 5. So if 3 survivors are dead, you need to repair 2 gens. If 3 gens are repaired, the hatch will appear after 2 dead guys. And if 4 gens are repaired, the hatch will appear after 1 dead guy.
[2017-06-26 21:32:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hello hello DeadByFleshLight

[2017-06-26 21:37:29 UTC] rikytikytavi: Phil, the magical number of hatch is 5. So if 3 survivors are dead, you need to repair 2 gens. If 3 gens are repaired, the hatch will appear after 2 dead guys. And if 4 gens are repaired, the hatch will appear after 1 dead guy.
