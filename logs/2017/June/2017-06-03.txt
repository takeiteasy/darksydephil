[2017-06-03 02:08:27 UTC] bigtone995: How was the first stream
[2017-06-03 02:08:30 UTC] darksydephil: it was just a bunch of dumbfucks who know nothin about fighting games trying to act like they did because Shin Akuma is an insanely tough optional boss
[2017-06-03 02:08:33 UTC] ellietsantiara: Hey dudes
[2017-06-03 02:08:39 UTC] darksydephil: nothing too special, considering it happens every time i play fighting games

[2017-06-03 02:08:47 UTC] derichloveslemur: There's a terrible troll who won't stop leaving me alone. But I blocked him
[2017-06-03 02:08:48 UTC] nin10dont: online combos

[2017-06-03 02:09:00 UTC] derichloveslemur: Gosh I do hate trolls.
[2017-06-03 02:09:06 UTC] deep_drive: yep just block them derich
[2017-06-03 02:09:13 UTC] deep_drive: no need to waste your time with them
[2017-06-03 02:09:13 UTC] pureo_nikku: optional bosses are usually pretty tough from what I can assess, it's like u get one try and then that's it
[2017-06-03 02:09:27 UTC] pureo_nikku: dural, chameleon, shin akuma lol
[2017-06-03 02:09:27 UTC] derichloveslemur: I did @deep_drive. Ain't nobody got time for them trolls

[2017-06-03 02:09:48 UTC] bigtone995: @darksydephil
[2017-06-03 02:09:51 UTC] iarkana: Shin Akuma isn't THAT bad, the problem is that to get semi competent at Tekken you have to put in a LOT of time, time that Phil simply doesn't have
[2017-06-03 02:09:51 UTC] akioartorius: avoid bridges
[2017-06-03 02:09:52 UTC] ughhhj: I always wonder what the trolls want from phil, like how do they want this whole thing to end?
[2017-06-03 02:09:58 UTC] ellietsantiara: Wow its a miracle, today I didn't receive racist messages from the SoK, strange TheIlluminati Kappa
