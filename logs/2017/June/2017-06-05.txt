[2017-06-05 18:12:30 UTC] auzziesly47adam: that is disgusting that people do that
[2017-06-05 18:12:34 UTC] errnoent: Phil I was going to tell you, I watched the week in preview. You've gotta exercise man, seriously. You're still considered sedentary even if you go out and do errands and such.
[2017-06-05 18:12:38 UTC] zahvone: Hey, Phil - I don't want to pry too much, and I know it wouldn't be for a long time but are you planning on moving back home anytime in the future?
[2017-06-05 18:12:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I didn't think it was that big of a question what is the appeal of the Cavs over the trailblazers didn't think you would get so haughty about it Slothy :(

[2017-06-05 18:13:08 UTC] forwardarro: Oh also Phil, people will watch for games like Adventure 1/2, Shadow the Hedgehog, and Unleashed, thye won't care about Sonic 1-3. The Sonic 06 appeal is the 3D games not 2D js
[2017-06-05 18:13:10 UTC] thirdeyethethird: phil, a decent home gym would cost you less than 200 bucks for basic exercises
[2017-06-05 18:13:19 UTC] cherry_dood: I'm sure running errands isn't all he's talking about @errnoent. Didn't he say he'd be walking?
[2017-06-05 18:13:20 UTC] podusmonens: I don't think news have time for dead puppies when Trump is POTUS

[2017-06-05 18:14:01 UTC] yaslothy: I hope LeBron retires and they're stuck in limbo forever
[2017-06-05 18:14:02 UTC] darksydephil: id play sonic adventure 1/2 for sure
[2017-06-05 18:14:05 UTC] yaslothy: fuck them
[2017-06-05 18:14:05 UTC] darksydephil: that would be pretty fun
[2017-06-05 18:14:06 UTC] errnoent: cherry_dood I didn't see that, maybe he did. Anyway, the important thing is getting your heart rate up and pumping for at least a few minutes each day. And not by raging lol
[2017-06-05 18:14:07 UTC] podusmonens: jimmy he's a white pale curly kid from the burbs, him watching NBA is a joke in and of itself
[2017-06-05 18:14:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: jeez slothy calm down
[2017-06-05 18:14:23 UTC] forwardarro: Please play Adventure 1/2

[2017-06-05 18:15:22 UTC] yaslothy: I'm uncultured swine, so that's impossible. Sounds like self projection.
[2017-06-05 18:15:26 UTC] sissydiejungwkaiserin: without something for cardio
[2017-06-05 18:15:29 UTC] thirdeyethethird: i live in a canadian suburb, the closest gym to me charges 120 bucks a fucking month, and you can only come in on a schedule built around other ppl

[2017-06-05 18:16:56 UTC] deep_drive: wow
[2017-06-05 18:16:59 UTC] darksydephil: i guess people like SA2 over 1? i never played 2, only had a burnt copy that crapped out after a few hours due to glitches
[2017-06-05 18:17:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Slothy has the Monday blues I think :(
[2017-06-05 18:17:07 UTC] dspfandood: 2 is the better game.
[2017-06-05 18:17:22 UTC] thirdeyethethird: when i lived in a big city, i paid for a huge gym, only 60 bucks for the whole summer
[2017-06-05 18:17:23 UTC] dspfandood: the best 3d sonic game imo
[2017-06-05 18:17:24 UTC] forwardarro: Eh I prefer SA1

[2017-06-05 18:37:04 UTC] charizard545: premediated crime without the intent of following up on it. really gets the noggin joggin

[2017-06-05 20:22:03 UTC] errnoent: That is a different game Phil... if there's one thing I've learned about fighting games is that no matter how stupid and nonsensical they can be, you need to adapt to them in order to be successful
[2017-06-05 20:22:04 UTC] dusty_beer: why would u turn chat off?

[2017-06-05 20:22:47 UTC] pescharlie: There's no point to learning juggles if you can't land them. Let's not say that Tekken is watered down. Still the most complex fighting game on the market
[2017-06-05 20:22:51 UTC] midnight_strike_force: So Tekken used to be like Street Fighter? I dunno... Tekken 2 wasn't exactly a 2D game.
[2017-06-05 20:22:53 UTC] akioartorius: which Jack model was the one who could fly?

[2017-06-05 20:41:33 UTC] adrian_digital: better
[2017-06-05 20:41:34 UTC] therealrapgeek: Injustice 2 or Tekken 7
