[2017-06-09 18:31:44 UTC] hisui4: i dont really think theres such a thing as a real job in this day and age. you either have two options, be your own boss or let someone else be the boss of you while waiting for the time you will get cut for any possible reason. University teachers are actually saying that you should expect to be job hopping within 2 years of getting hired. 4 years is a miracle.

[2017-06-09 20:54:35 UTC] leonaras: most herbivores are opportunistic omnivores anyway.
[2017-06-09 20:54:36 UTC] n7_titan82: You know what the cave man word for bad hunter is? Vegetarian
[2017-06-09 20:54:37 UTC] derpie12: I think that's a thing to fight the Detractors especially a certain set of people
[2017-06-09 20:54:56 UTC] kinggoken: lol freedom chat
[2017-06-09 20:54:56 UTC] hisui4: I'd actually like to see phil's reaction to nintendo's bizarre press conference. i think it would be really fun and funny :D doubt he'd be willing to but it would make for some good laughs and at least you could count on it not being boring because its so weird
[2017-06-09 20:54:58 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's the chat of the democratic republic of China MingLee
[2017-06-09 20:55:10 UTC] kinggoken: I went there one time and the people there flipped out
[2017-06-09 20:55:21 UTC] duderito2: "Freedom" chat as long as you're part of the circle jerk
[2017-06-09 20:55:23 UTC] yaslothy: @Leonaras It's as simple as this for me: I'm well off enough to get by by not eating meat...I've survived thus far without eating it..so why should I?
[2017-06-09 20:55:26 UTC] derpie12: Like he'd needa get so much demand for that to happen and even then yeah...
[2017-06-09 20:55:31 UTC] kinggoken: dsps haters should just come here and chat
[2017-06-09 20:55:37 UTC] deep_drive: They banned vidar cuz they couldn't take him pc

[2017-06-09 20:55:48 UTC] rhoadsozzy25: did it end?
[2017-06-09 20:55:58 UTC] derpie12: Especially if Vidar is here...
[2017-06-09 20:56:02 UTC] ellietsantiara: Freedom chat is where the detractors and SOK kids circle jerk eachother
[2017-06-09 20:56:02 UTC] ginosaji8: break
[2017-06-09 20:56:04 UTC] leonaras: they didnt ban vidar. they kicked him.
[2017-06-09 20:56:16 UTC] yaslothy: obviously we've evolved past being a caveman, so shall we still eat like them?
[2017-06-09 20:56:18 UTC] leonaras: huge difference

[2017-06-09 20:56:28 UTC] dukaduka: OpieOP this chat sometimes
[2017-06-09 20:56:37 UTC] n7_titan82: The way to defeat detractors is not to talk about his private life,finances and so forth...if he stopped talking about that,they would have nothing too attack him with
[2017-06-09 20:56:45 UTC] kinggoken: anyone here actually play Shadow The Hedgehog?
[2017-06-09 20:56:51 UTC] misterdragin: @YaSlothy because your dietary needs didn;t evolve :)

[2017-06-09 20:57:06 UTC] yaslothy: Poooound
[2017-06-09 20:57:10 UTC] misterdragin: that big brain of yours still requires protein
[2017-06-09 20:57:12 UTC] misterdragin: dummy
[2017-06-09 20:57:16 UTC] deep_drive: Ok they kicked him cuz he was too much for them

[2017-06-09 20:57:23 UTC] pcgamehunter: Cherdy just eat the owls and stop being picky Kappa
[2017-06-09 20:57:23 UTC] yaslothy: protein can be found in other forms eh?
[2017-06-09 20:57:31 UTC] misterdragin: it's not the same
[2017-06-09 20:57:32 UTC] parru030: They eat Protein pills
[2017-06-09 20:57:36 UTC] yaslothy: obviously you're smart enough to recognize this
[2017-06-09 20:57:36 UTC] parru030: large head
[2017-06-09 20:57:41 UTC] misterdragin: I try to get protein from pistacchio nuts and whatever
[2017-06-09 20:57:43 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Deep_Drive Props to Vidar :P
[2017-06-09 20:57:51 UTC] leonaras: " too much" , good one EleGiggle
[2017-06-09 20:57:52 UTC] misterdragin: but nothing compares to a juicy STEAK
[2017-06-09 20:57:55 UTC] n7_titan82: Derpie,he can stop that by admiting he doesnt know how to play the game..-.I have seen him be good at some games...
[2017-06-09 20:57:57 UTC] beholderchil: man Phil looked bored to tears with this game
[2017-06-09 20:58:02 UTC] ughhhj: What happened is he taking a break? Did he finish the game?
[2017-06-09 20:58:05 UTC] parru030: Steak is good
[2017-06-09 20:58:06 UTC] yaslothy: then try harder dragin
[2017-06-09 20:58:09 UTC] parru030: makes you happy
[2017-06-09 20:58:09 UTC] kinggoken: is dsp going to play more tekken 7 or is he d one with it?
[2017-06-09 20:58:12 UTC] gdayguy36: Did he quit?
[2017-06-09 20:58:14 UTC] akioartorius: break time
[2017-06-09 20:58:18 UTC] derpie12: That's impossible to get rid of unless Phil can DMCA all those videos and even then there are other sites
[2017-06-09 20:58:33 UTC] misterdragin: what vegetarian stuff is good for protein? except from nuts
[2017-06-09 20:58:36 UTC] duderito2: Isn't that where the former mod who pretended to be a female for a year all to tamper with Nightbot commands resides? A true meeting of the minds I guess.
[2017-06-09 20:58:39 UTC] misterdragin: and I include all kinds
[2017-06-09 20:58:42 UTC] akioartorius: More Tekken 7 with VenomousFatman on Sunday Phil said
[2017-06-09 20:58:42 UTC] n7_titan82: Derpie,they fall under fair use...
[2017-06-09 20:58:52 UTC] kinggoken: cool :)
[2017-06-09 20:58:53 UTC] ellietsantiara: @n7_titan82 He does admit he sucks at most games and that he doesn't always see things that are in front of him, and he even admits he's salty
[2017-06-09 20:58:57 UTC] derpie12: Yeah but Phil would want them gone...
[2017-06-09 20:59:03 UTC] yaslothy: eggs, hummus,seeds, nuts
[2017-06-09 20:59:06 UTC] parru030: Nuts from hospital too?
[2017-06-09 20:59:12 UTC] derpie12: It's the other thing Detractors have against him
[2017-06-09 20:59:14 UTC] hisui4: @n7_titan82 not really because now if he dosnt talk about it theyll just continue to make stuff up like usual, just this time no one will have a reference to go to to see if its true or not. and there are plent who will just take his silence as being confirmation that what they said is true. i understand people dont want to waste their time fighting, but you cant go through life without defending yourself. keeping silent doesnt make it stop, it just makes them kick you harder.
[2017-06-09 20:59:15 UTC] dukaduka: Its crazy that if i search DSP on youtube, most of the top videos are channels bashing DSP LUL
[2017-06-09 20:59:17 UTC] misterdragin: I eat eggs and hummus like a modafocka too
[2017-06-09 20:59:25 UTC] derpie12: Also he'd have to drop the comments
[2017-06-09 20:59:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: do you like Quorn YaSlothy ?
[2017-06-09 20:59:29 UTC] n7_titan82: Elliet,I am not attacking him...
[2017-06-09 20:59:30 UTC] yaslothy: never had it
[2017-06-09 20:59:31 UTC] ellietsantiara: So the detractors have no logical explanation to their hate towards Phil
[2017-06-09 20:59:32 UTC] misterdragin: but hummus ishigh in sugar.. at least the one I buy
[2017-06-09 20:59:36 UTC] ughhhj: @ellietsantiara loved the comment of you calling him hot ahahah
[2017-06-09 20:59:37 UTC] deep_drive: Yes...restreaming a live stream is fair use! Uhhhhh...no
[2017-06-09 20:59:45 UTC] parru030: i eat testicles to gain more man power
[2017-06-09 20:59:57 UTC] silenthill51: wheres phil

[2017-06-09 21:00:08 UTC] kinggoken: dsp is on break
[2017-06-09 21:00:13 UTC] dukaduka: @Parru030 you eat balls?

[2017-06-09 21:00:19 UTC] misterdragin: and I said except nuts :P take them away and you don't have much left
[2017-06-09 21:00:23 UTC] parru030: Balls are the best
[2017-06-09 21:00:23 UTC] burnout26: that was a good klondike bar I had
[2017-06-09 21:00:23 UTC] maminas: phil has perished, and now he has a taken a form of a ghost and trying to stream as one
[2017-06-09 21:00:27 UTC] n7_titan82: Deep,do you think he's the only one who has his streams reposted on YT by random strangers?
[2017-06-09 21:00:34 UTC] yaslothy: Anyways, no matter if you eat meat or not you're always lacking some essential vitamin or protein source. It's just a personal preference of not eating something that was once alive.
[2017-06-09 21:00:37 UTC] jl_volken: He's a bathroom ghost now
[2017-06-09 21:00:46 UTC] parru030: Even fetus is good
[2017-06-09 21:00:46 UTC] ellietsantiara: @n7_titan82 i know but understand that detractors don't have a reason to hate him... They're just idiotic kids with pathetic lives
[2017-06-09 21:00:47 UTC] deep_drive: Probably not n7
[2017-06-09 21:00:48 UTC] kinggoken: LTG is another youtuebr that gets his streams reposted to youtube. Its funny stuff.
[2017-06-09 21:00:50 UTC] misterdragin: plants die too Slothy
[2017-06-09 21:00:59 UTC] hisui4: @misterdragin its just bandwagoning. if you really want to see the identity of these detractors, theres a youtube channel called ihateeverything who actually identifies who these youtube haters are and its pretty laughable. worst part is theyre all the same.
[2017-06-09 21:01:00 UTC] dukaduka: @YaSlothy you can get protein and other vitamins elsewhere SeemsGood
[2017-06-09 21:01:01 UTC] yaslothy: well you have to draw the line somewhere dragin
[2017-06-09 21:01:05 UTC] deep_drive: In fact lots of people repost other YouTube vids
[2017-06-09 21:01:17 UTC] ellietsantiara: @ughhhj Lol yeah
[2017-06-09 21:01:17 UTC] deep_drive: It's a bad practice
[2017-06-09 21:01:19 UTC] gdayguy36: Lots of them do have legit reasons to criticize him
[2017-06-09 21:01:24 UTC] maminas: whats everyones runecrafting level?
[2017-06-09 21:01:25 UTC] burnout26: I know there is a channel that archieves all of Totalbiscuits stream on YT
[2017-06-09 21:01:29 UTC] kinggoken: the detractors would stop making videos about DSP once they stop getting high views on their hate videos
[2017-06-09 21:01:32 UTC] n7_titan82: Elliet,I don't understand why they are obsessed with him :/
[2017-06-09 21:01:38 UTC] parru030: but i love cats on my plate
[2017-06-09 21:01:41 UTC] leonaras: slothy, thats what consumption is. eating something that was alive. or produced from something alive
[2017-06-09 21:01:42 UTC] misterdragin: so some forms of life are more valuable than others? where exactly do you draw the line?
[2017-06-09 21:01:49 UTC] ughhhj: @ellietsantiara it was on such a serious picture to Ahahah
[2017-06-09 21:01:49 UTC] misterdragin: at cognition?
[2017-06-09 21:01:53 UTC] betheallen: i revive plants after i step on them i got a healing touch
[2017-06-09 21:01:58 UTC] kinggoken: like the one dude with detractor ball z on his videos sometimes...
[2017-06-09 21:02:18 UTC] deep_drive: Most of the vids are just phils gameplay...nothing transformative about that
[2017-06-09 21:02:22 UTC] misterdragin: some animals don't feel pain
[2017-06-09 21:02:26 UTC] n7_titan82: King,I've seen a few...and honestly....my 4 year old could edit better then them...especially SoK vids...talk about talking for hours about nothing
[2017-06-09 21:02:32 UTC] gdayguy36: You mean Tevin? Lol
[2017-06-09 21:02:32 UTC] ellietsantiara: @n7_titan82 That makes all of us... They're just kids that have no meaning in their life so they harass and try to ruin someone else's life to feel important.
[2017-06-09 21:02:35 UTC] kinggoken: lol
[2017-06-09 21:02:39 UTC] forwardarro: detractordɪˈtraktənounplural noun: detractorsa person who disparages someone or something.
[2017-06-09 21:02:44 UTC] yaslothy: Well, I'm not gonna convince flesh eaters to stop eating flesh and you're not gonna convince me to stop not eating flesh so let's drop it.
[2017-06-09 21:02:55 UTC] vpzneox: eerm
[2017-06-09 21:02:55 UTC] hisui4: @kinggoken that certainly would ease things down a bit, but it wouldnt put a complete stop to it. most of these detractors are actually kids ( i mean that literally not as an insult ). and if they get even one view, it probably counts as encouragement to keep doing it
[2017-06-09 21:02:55 UTC] kurokishi2013: Most of the vids I've seen do add some form of comentary which IS transformative
[2017-06-09 21:03:00 UTC] dukaduka: OpieOP oh chat lol
[2017-06-09 21:03:03 UTC] vpzneox: where's phil
[2017-06-09 21:03:03 UTC] kurokishi2013: Plus they cut out most of the material
[2017-06-09 21:03:09 UTC] leonaras: could argue that Phil's wwork isnt transformative with that logic deep
[2017-06-09 21:03:10 UTC] kinggoken: hmmm I see
[2017-06-09 21:03:10 UTC] yaslothy: Meat eating talk is about as cancerous as political or religious talk.
[2017-06-09 21:03:14 UTC] ughhhj: I don't think I've been to a stream where the chat doesn't talk about the detractors : (
[2017-06-09 21:03:33 UTC] doctormaul: Hello everyone
[2017-06-09 21:03:38 UTC] misterdragin: that wasn't the point of my question. I'm not trying to convince you of anything. I wanted to know what your position is, exactly. where do you draw the line between what is OK and not OK to eat
[2017-06-09 21:03:44 UTC] betheallen: sloth you like peanuts?
[2017-06-09 21:03:46 UTC] deep_drive: You call meat eaters people who eat flesh...you make it sounfd like carnivores slothy
[2017-06-09 21:03:49 UTC] kinggoken: on the bright side, the detractors are kind of helping dsp. They are exposing his channel to people that never heard of him.
[2017-06-09 21:03:53 UTC] deep_drive: That's offensive
[2017-06-09 21:03:54 UTC] yaslothy: not really bethe
[2017-06-09 21:04:06 UTC] betheallen: /me shares peanuts with sloth
[2017-06-09 21:04:08 UTC] parru030: just eat what you like
[2017-06-09 21:04:09 UTC] gdayguy36: Sometimes I think DSPs fans care more about the detractors than he does
[2017-06-09 21:04:12 UTC] misterdragin: he only likes deeznuts bethe
[2017-06-09 21:04:12 UTC] yaslothy: @MisterDragin there is no line drawn...lets just eat everything :)

[2017-06-09 21:04:16 UTC] yaslothy: @Deep_Drive k
[2017-06-09 21:04:25 UTC] burnout26: DSP is getting publicity even if its negative its stil publicity
[2017-06-09 21:04:26 UTC] ughhhj: @gdayguy36 yeah unfortunately
[2017-06-09 21:04:34 UTC] betheallen: dragin i know he likes your nuts
[2017-06-09 21:04:35 UTC] hisui4: @kinggoken true.

[2017-06-09 21:04:39 UTC] misterdragin: no, no, no.. tell me. that was your statement, that you have to draw the line somewhere. where?
[2017-06-09 21:04:45 UTC] radicalenzyme: What are you guys talking about what publicity ?
[2017-06-09 21:04:55 UTC] ellietsantiara: @gdayguy36 Nope, they don't. Some of us who have been watching and following DSP since the beginning know how he was, and how he has changed. People make mistakes and everyone deserves to change their opinions, behaviors and else for good. Phil has changed for good a lot in i years and that Is one of the reasons I admire him. But the detractors simply can't let anything go...
[2017-06-09 21:05:03 UTC] tyronegordo: jesus tl;dr
[2017-06-09 21:05:16 UTC] yaslothy: @MisterDragin OpieOP
[2017-06-09 21:05:18 UTC] radicalenzyme: What happened
[2017-06-09 21:05:24 UTC] ughhhj: @deep_drive as someone who eats meat I know where the food I get comes from and it's not humane most of the time unfortunately...
[2017-06-09 21:05:44 UTC] betheallen: dont tell him anything sloth he will use it against you
[2017-06-09 21:05:46 UTC] ozolta: hey phil been watching you since the stone age! love your kahtent dont let the detrators get to u !
[2017-06-09 21:05:59 UTC] yaslothy: does meat taste good? sure...but If I stuck dragin in an oven and ate him it'd probably taste pretty good as well SeemsGood
[2017-06-09 21:06:02 UTC] deep_drive: All depends where you get the meat
[2017-06-09 21:06:06 UTC] gdayguy36: Lol
[2017-06-09 21:06:07 UTC] duderito2: I watched the show once one dude sounds like Squidward and his nasally voice that goes through my head. The female host sole purpose is to be a laugh track to all their "jokes". Another guy sole purpose is to sperg out and do hammed up OTT rants how diabolical Phil apparently is
[2017-06-09 21:06:11 UTC] tyronegordo: @oZolta you forgot to donate 10 cents Kappa
[2017-06-09 21:06:18 UTC] misterdragin: I'm not trying to convince you to eat meat, it;s good for you that you don't. I;m just trying to understand your weltanschauung
[2017-06-09 21:06:24 UTC] leonaras: I eat steak. rare. dont think life would be as interesting as it is without steak.
[2017-06-09 21:06:24 UTC] tyronegordo: what the fuck is this chat though
[2017-06-09 21:06:25 UTC] ughhhj: So wait phil cares more about the detractors then? @ellietsantiara
[2017-06-09 21:06:29 UTC] hisui4: @ellietsantiara true. because they just dont care. all they want to do is vent their frustrations by hating someone and doubly get some fame out of it on youtube. plus theres a community built around that hate, which gives them a place to belong. which makes them even more attached to it.
[2017-06-09 21:06:34 UTC] gdayguy36: Take a sip dood
[2017-06-09 21:06:35 UTC] yaslothy: OpieOP
[2017-06-09 21:06:37 UTC] duderito2: finally the leader of the pack Fred Fuchs the PolSci guy is giving advice how Phil should get a job that is more stable, I hope the irony isn't lost on him that potential employers wont be jumping over hurdles to hire a Pol Sci major.
[2017-06-09 21:06:40 UTC] kinggoken: lol dude soundling like Squidward
[2017-06-09 21:06:45 UTC] misterdragin: I wouldn't taste good buddy, trust me

[2017-06-09 21:06:55 UTC] betheallen: it will be nice as fuck
[2017-06-09 21:06:55 UTC] ellietsantiara: But anyway, as the ol' saying goes, Giving reason to an asshole is making them bigger, so no point trying to reason with them

[2017-06-09 21:07:05 UTC] kinggoken: which channel is this? Where the guy sounds like squidward
[2017-06-09 21:07:06 UTC] derpie12: I wouldn't recommend talking about that group...
[2017-06-09 21:07:08 UTC] yaslothy: But some seasoning on it and I'm sure I could get it down.
[2017-06-09 21:07:11 UTC] yaslothy: Put*
[2017-06-09 21:07:23 UTC] ughhhj: @n7_titan82 I wish he could ignore them but he doesn't...

[2017-06-09 21:07:46 UTC] hisui4: @n7_titan82 theyll move on..... only for the next group of ten year olds to take over. lol.
[2017-06-09 21:07:53 UTC] ellietsantiara: @ughhhj No, he doesn't care really. And neither shall anyone, there just a bunch of weird and pathetic people. Better to just ignore them

[2017-06-09 21:08:07 UTC] derpie12: Phil can't ignore him cuz a certain group is like the Phantom Thieves always sending calling cards to him
[2017-06-09 21:08:14 UTC] betheallen: deep but that runs thinks orange
[2017-06-09 21:08:16 UTC] yaslothy: @katexo234 yes i have
[2017-06-09 21:08:26 UTC] misterdragin: everyone has detractors.. reviewtech has his fair share of trolls just as dedicated as phil's given the fact that he's really not controversial
[2017-06-09 21:08:35 UTC] n7_titan82: Hisui,its the internet...who cares what they say or do...its not like they actually can effect anything
[2017-06-09 21:08:36 UTC] pelathius: did phil forget us? lol

[2017-06-09 21:08:48 UTC] ughhhj: @ellietsantiara oh no cause the way the guy worded the question was that either we care more about the detractors or phil does
[2017-06-09 21:08:51 UTC] yaslothy: Phil's eating a big tasty steak Kappa
[2017-06-09 21:08:52 UTC] n7_titan82: He went to bed and forgot he was streaming

[2017-06-09 21:09:30 UTC] ellietsantiara: @n7_titan82 Agreed, even the SoK admit that they're a bunch of pathetic loses and being part of the SoK makes them relevant in life.
[2017-06-09 21:09:32 UTC] derpie12: Rich's detractors aren't that bad tho DSP's tho...

[2017-06-09 21:10:11 UTC] vpzneox: that leg scratching mechanic is harsh =O
[2017-06-09 21:10:12 UTC] hisui4: @n7_titan82 it does if the hate is enough to hurt your business and damage your reputation. the internet is not the one attacking him, its a group of people. and what people say, no matter how stupid, tends to effect how other people perceive things to be. thats why defamation is a punishable crime. because it can hurt you and usually does.
[2017-06-09 21:10:14 UTC] shlomograbinstein: So is phil dead? Why is he taking so long

[2017-06-09 21:11:17 UTC] n7_titan82: Rich is one of the biggest clickbaiters on YouTube...I understand why people hate RTU
