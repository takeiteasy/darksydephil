[2017-06-27 05:10:02 UTC] darksydephil: cool enjoy! get caught up if you can
[2017-06-27 05:10:18 UTC] josephchalker: Will do, was up to Part 51 last night
[2017-06-27 05:10:29 UTC] josephchalker: so continuing on from there
[2017-06-27 05:10:38 UTC] pacman5twitch: @DarksydePhil enjoyed your stream for what I was able to see I probably catch up on your youtube later.
[2017-06-27 05:11:15 UTC] eriquw: Phil that question I asked earlier was serious. I've asked for help to get involved in the FGC before but was met with a lot of toxicity. You seem so positive
[2017-06-27 05:11:29 UTC] 6th_moral: I'm so ready for more Red Dead. Those have been good streams overall.
[2017-06-27 05:12:51 UTC] spazz3: lol
[2017-06-27 05:15:37 UTC] darksydephil: Eriquw the thing is that USF2 is really Super Turbo, an over 20 year old game. I doubt anybody really cares if I did tutorials for it lol
[2017-06-27 05:16:24 UTC] spazz3: old schools like me would care
[2017-06-27 05:16:28 UTC] eriquw: eh some of us are old :)
[2017-06-27 05:16:32 UTC] spazz3: ^
[2017-06-27 05:17:07 UTC] spazz3: I remember Street fighter 1 from the arcades xD
[2017-06-27 05:17:26 UTC] eriquw: I remember playing MK in the arcades
[2017-06-27 05:17:34 UTC] spazz3: me 2
[2017-06-27 05:17:48 UTC] spazz3: I was more of a snk kid at the time
[2017-06-27 05:18:03 UTC] eriquw: I even bought SFV trying to learn it, but I guess my muscle memory is still in MK
[2017-06-27 05:18:19 UTC] spazz3: ^ yeah
[2017-06-27 05:18:43 UTC] spazz3: I played tekken 1,2 and playing 7 now and its hard xD
[2017-06-27 05:19:12 UTC] spazz3: tekken 7 feels like work
[2017-06-27 05:19:14 UTC] eriquw: I mean I was ok at MKX but I was met with a LOT of toxicity
[2017-06-27 05:19:23 UTC] spazz3: ahh
[2017-06-27 05:19:34 UTC] eriquw: might be the whole chick thing I dont know.
[2017-06-27 05:19:36 UTC] darksydephil: fuck
[2017-06-27 05:19:42 UTC] darksydephil: if you missed tekken 3-6 you missed generations of shit lol
[2017-06-27 05:19:46 UTC] spazz3: whats wrong Phil?
[2017-06-27 05:19:47 UTC] darksydephil: so many new things int he game now
[2017-06-27 05:20:00 UTC] darksydephil: tekken is one of the hardest overall fighting franchises to just jump into
[2017-06-27 05:20:01 UTC] darksydephil: its very complex
[2017-06-27 05:20:10 UTC] spazz3: yeah I missed 3-6 cause i was into KoF and won couple tourneys in korea
[2017-06-27 05:20:18 UTC] 0000anonymous: phil. I missed the stream, will it be archived here?
[2017-06-27 05:20:19 UTC] spazz3: nothing big
[2017-06-27 05:20:28 UTC] kekon3: on the plus side, skipping tekken 5-Tag2, you missed characters being changed every game
[2017-06-27 05:20:53 UTC] eriquw: I went to watch and support my friend who was in the... I think they call it the pool? at EVO
[2017-06-27 05:21:03 UTC] spazz3: learning them now is a bit difficult
[2017-06-27 05:21:15 UTC] eriquw: some of the people were super nice. but some were just downright cruel.
[2017-06-27 05:21:16 UTC] spazz3: my hands are not what it use to be
[2017-06-27 05:21:30 UTC] eriquw: I left EVO with a very negative impression of the FGC
[2017-06-27 05:21:37 UTC] kekon3: Tekken community is coming out to try to make sure people understand the game though, that makes me happy. Injustice seems unapproachable to me :\
[2017-06-27 05:21:38 UTC] spazz3: really
[2017-06-27 05:21:47 UTC] huntingowlgames: phil finished?
[2017-06-27 05:21:49 UTC] spazz3: that's good
[2017-06-27 05:22:05 UTC] spazz3: Aris seems to try hard
[2017-06-27 05:22:19 UTC] kekon3: Aris has love for the game, probably why
[2017-06-27 05:22:29 UTC] kekon3: happy to see it grow
[2017-06-27 05:22:34 UTC] spazz3: I can understand
[2017-06-27 05:22:41 UTC] spazz3: Tekken is a good game
[2017-06-27 05:23:38 UTC] kekon3: I think it's cause tekken is hard is why I'm happy people are still going for it. In the days of fighters trying to make themselves too easy, there's still love for a hard as nails game
[2017-06-27 05:23:55 UTC] kekon3: even though T7 got easier lol
[2017-06-27 05:23:56 UTC] spazz3: Wish Tekken 7 had tutorials cause that would help the community grow more
[2017-06-27 05:24:12 UTC] kekon3: same, and practice mode barely functions how it should
[2017-06-27 05:24:18 UTC] eriquw: I definitely would like to learn Tekken7 it looks absolutely amazing
[2017-06-27 05:24:31 UTC] kekon3: made me think about how developer tools can make or break a fighting game experience
[2017-06-27 05:25:02 UTC] spazz3: I think i should start out with paul first since I dont have to worry about combo's
[2017-06-27 05:25:22 UTC] spazz3: even though I use to be a kazuya main in tekken 1
[2017-06-27 05:25:28 UTC] spazz3: xD lol
[2017-06-27 05:25:38 UTC] spazz3: kazuya's alot harder now
[2017-06-27 05:26:01 UTC] kekon3: Nah, I'll say play who you want, regardless of how hard they seem. but maybe I think that way cause I enjoy the grind of learning too.
[2017-06-27 05:26:01 UTC] spazz3: hope you play more tekken kekon! I need to learn man
[2017-06-27 05:26:17 UTC] 6th_moral: hmu on Steam

[2017-06-27 05:27:32 UTC] spazz3: I wanted to play tekken right now but I have a family health crisis with my mom so its hard to get into tekken deep FailFish
[2017-06-27 05:28:02 UTC] 6th_moral: Play Tekken with your mom in the hospital
[2017-06-27 05:28:25 UTC] 6th_moral: I wonder if you brought a PS4 to a hospital if they'd actually let you hook it up
[2017-06-27 05:28:36 UTC] spazz3: My mom always hated me playing games lol
[2017-06-27 05:29:05 UTC] josephchalker: Hmm, SNES Classic Mini for $120 - tempting
[2017-06-27 05:29:16 UTC] spazz3: the tI use to be hardcore enough to buy a Neo Geo at the time... dam my mom got mad at me xD
[2017-06-27 05:29:27 UTC] josephchalker: I've never played any of the Tekken games
[2017-06-27 05:29:45 UTC] spazz3: tekken is fun but takes alot of work man
[2017-06-27 05:30:04 UTC] spazz3: if I get gud enough I can spar with kekon :D
[2017-06-27 05:30:10 UTC] josephchalker: @DarksydePhil Are you getting a Classic Mini SNES if you're still here Phil?

[2017-06-27 19:42:24 UTC] chairmancaleb: @jackwhite202, Few reasons. The pacing (chapters will be drawn out longer than necessary), the animation (can be absolutely disgusting to look at) and the long unnecessary recaps that take up the first 5-7 minutes of the episode.

[2017-06-27 22:00:29 UTC] midnight_strike_force: I swear I heard fast and heavy breathing.
[2017-06-27 22:00:30 UTC] theycallmejimbob: not sure about the crossplay :(

[2017-06-27 22:00:48 UTC] jacobhoward321: On a daily basis

[2017-06-27 22:01:54 UTC] deep_drive: well bobbi the casuals don't like kof
[2017-06-27 22:01:54 UTC] xgameofpwns: The twitch streamer in the 5 hour energy ad streams 12 hours a day...3 times longer than Phil
[2017-06-27 22:01:56 UTC] ubska: Has it finished already?
[2017-06-27 22:02:03 UTC] yaslothy: I hope there isnt another incident
[2017-06-27 22:02:05 UTC] mcismydream: So Phil has 15 shirts on his store?
[2017-06-27 22:02:06 UTC] jacobhoward321: DSP needs to be in these commercials. "Hello everyone, and welcome to DSP gaming. Twitch is a place for raw and satisfying content"
[2017-06-27 22:02:07 UTC] zanba: is it wanky time
[2017-06-27 22:02:11 UTC] betheallen: phil muted it no

[2017-06-27 22:02:37 UTC] midnight_strike_force: Yeah *now* it's muted. Goodness. I thought we were getting another repeat of the May 1st incident.
[2017-06-27 22:02:43 UTC] kinggoken: lol
[2017-06-27 22:02:45 UTC] midnight_strike_force: Audio only this time.
[2017-06-27 22:02:47 UTC] deep_drive: what are you talking about bethe?
[2017-06-27 22:02:47 UTC] yaslothy: I hope he doesn't make the bald man cry
[2017-06-27 22:02:49 UTC] kingjezal: @JacobHoward321 That's not true for all streamers on Twitch, though. Phil is one of the only ones with raw, genuine, authentic content.
[2017-06-27 22:02:58 UTC] bobbi_ling: what are yous talking about, what mic
[2017-06-27 22:02:59 UTC] manajatwa123: Has anyone bought DSP's merchandise?
[2017-06-27 22:03:00 UTC] beholderchil: hmmm less viwers
[2017-06-27 22:03:02 UTC] kinggoken: dansgaming is pretty authentic
[2017-06-27 22:03:20 UTC] midnight_strike_force: I am authentic. I don't record gameplay but i'm pretty authentic.
[2017-06-27 22:03:21 UTC] jacobhoward321: Those pics tho.
[2017-06-27 22:03:21 UTC] ubska: DSP is the OG
[2017-06-27 22:03:24 UTC] yaslothy: Phil forgot to mute the mic bobbi
[2017-06-27 22:03:26 UTC] jamiepaulbaldwin: AH my belly button is bleeding halp
[2017-06-27 22:03:30 UTC] zanba: where is phil? For how long has this been going on now?
[2017-06-27 22:03:31 UTC] yaslothy: Ew
[2017-06-27 22:03:40 UTC] midnight_strike_force: Many, many years.
[2017-06-27 22:03:41 UTC] rockstar0182: the aaaaaaaaaaaaddddddsssssss
[2017-06-27 22:03:46 UTC] mcismydream: So i searched up the definition for authentic which means your saying he's a legit Streamer?
[2017-06-27 22:03:48 UTC] divanerasmus: Wazzup you Philly ?
[2017-06-27 22:03:53 UTC] obijee: 'Full' playthrough actually means I'll play til I get rekt by 'glitches' and 'lag' and cheap 'online mechanics' lmao]
[2017-06-27 22:03:54 UTC] bobbi_ling: how do you know cherdy? what do you hear
[2017-06-27 22:04:02 UTC] yaslothy: I hear AC
[2017-06-27 22:04:12 UTC] yaslothy: Ambient sounds
[2017-06-27 22:04:19 UTC] manajatwa123: lol "Online mechanics"
[2017-06-27 22:04:23 UTC] divanerasmus: Will he fap again ?
[2017-06-27 22:04:24 UTC] dark_stalkers95: Did he just start?
[2017-06-27 22:04:29 UTC] mcismydream: Lol
[2017-06-27 22:04:32 UTC] jamiepaulbaldwin: Phil is my god i bow down and pray to him 3 times a day
[2017-06-27 22:04:33 UTC] deep_drive: hes on break guys
[2017-06-27 22:04:39 UTC] manajatwa123: He said 20 minute break
[2017-06-27 22:04:40 UTC] kingjezal: @mcismydream Yes, no artificial passions contrived for the sake of appeasing viewers. He is only real.
[2017-06-27 22:04:54 UTC] mcismydream: He got caught doing it on Stream the other year.
[2017-06-27 22:04:56 UTC] zanba: when did it start
[2017-06-27 22:05:03 UTC] jacobhoward321: Guys, I think DSP could be my most favorite let's player honestly. I mean he's funny, a great gamer, wealthy, and loyal to everyone. Bugged Fan mechanics
[2017-06-27 22:05:08 UTC] yaslothy: 2 hours ago
[2017-06-27 22:05:10 UTC] midnight_strike_force: May 1st, 2016.

[2017-06-27 22:05:13 UTC] dark_stalkers95: Lmao @mcismydream
[2017-06-27 22:05:18 UTC] kingjezal: @mcismydream Wasn't intentional. It wasn't scheduled content.
[2017-06-27 22:05:27 UTC] ubska: He didnt admit he fapped tho, scratched his leg iirc
[2017-06-27 22:05:28 UTC] divanerasmus: he is making trout noises again SMOrc
[2017-06-27 22:05:31 UTC] midnight_strike_force: How do you schedule masturbation?
[2017-06-27 22:05:33 UTC] eternia_forever: real is the only way to be @KingJezal
[2017-06-27 22:05:34 UTC] capstonecommune: ugh
[2017-06-27 22:05:44 UTC] xgameofpwns: @JacobHoward321 :D
[2017-06-27 22:05:52 UTC] capstonecommune: so no good games this summer just dark souls 2 dangan slideshow 2 and sonic adventure 2?
[2017-06-27 22:05:55 UTC] strelok1876: @midnight_strike_force every break
[2017-06-27 22:05:57 UTC] xthewrath93x: @JacobHoward321 are you drunk?
[2017-06-27 22:05:58 UTC] dark_stalkers95: Ahshsbhejrkrkrk 😂😂@midnight_strike_force
[2017-06-27 22:06:08 UTC] capstonecommune: !schedule
[2017-06-27 22:06:08 UTC] nightbot: Tuesday is Red Dead Redemption at 12:30pm PDT and then possibly Danganronpa 2 at 7:30pm PDT IF my throat is up for it. We'll see!
[2017-06-27 22:06:13 UTC] xgameofpwns: How long has break been so far?
[2017-06-27 22:06:15 UTC] mfd4419: Good lord chatlol
[2017-06-27 22:06:16 UTC] bobbi_ling: whens souls 2 start?
[2017-06-27 22:06:16 UTC] strelok1876: fap break or stream is over?
[2017-06-27 22:06:17 UTC] kingjezal: @eternia_forever That's the only kind I care for, yeah.
[2017-06-27 22:06:18 UTC] midnight_strike_force: @Strelok1876 Ahh of course.
[2017-06-27 22:06:28 UTC] xthewrath93x: hentai time boiis
[2017-06-27 22:06:29 UTC] divanerasmus: He scratched that leg mighty hard man his head was up in the hear literally
[2017-06-27 22:06:31 UTC] ubska: looking forward to Danganrompa
[2017-06-27 22:06:36 UTC] iazy333: @Strelok1876 fap break
[2017-06-27 22:06:38 UTC] jacobhoward321: I wouldn't be surprise if Phil is fapping off screen
[2017-06-27 22:06:40 UTC] divanerasmus: air *
[2017-06-27 22:06:43 UTC] midnight_strike_force: I'm just saying it's a bit weird to say "No, he didn't schedule to fap" as if he's scheduled it before.
[2017-06-27 22:07:00 UTC] capstonecommune: hardcore gaming season hardcore fap
[2017-06-27 22:07:04 UTC] methr0llins: if he was fapping we'd hear it the mic isnt muted
[2017-06-27 22:07:07 UTC] strelok1876: who faps in his "work" place
[2017-06-27 22:07:08 UTC] midnight_strike_force: Very... professional wording for something that's kinda funny.
[2017-06-27 22:07:18 UTC] ubska: Some faps take longer than others though so cant really schedule it in
[2017-06-27 22:07:22 UTC] manajatwa123: Quality Khantent!
[2017-06-27 22:07:23 UTC] strelok1876: @methr0llins phil can be very silent about it
[2017-06-27 22:07:26 UTC] kingjezal: @midnight_strike_force Yes, he didn't schedule it. He left the camera on by accident, so we shouldn't be judging him for that.
[2017-06-27 22:07:37 UTC] xthewrath93x: we all fap
[2017-06-27 22:07:38 UTC] capstonecommune: i heard he ranted on tevin
[2017-06-27 22:07:45 UTC] strelok1876: @xthewrath93x not at the job tho
[2017-06-27 22:07:51 UTC] jacobhoward321: Yeah, I shouldn't be judging people that wanks infront of a camera.
[2017-06-27 22:07:54 UTC] jacobhoward321: No that's normal
[2017-06-27 22:07:54 UTC] xthewrath93x: but not all of us fap infront of a camera
[2017-06-27 22:08:09 UTC] mcismydream: Masturbation isn't such a wrong turn for the channel tho. Not unless if you do it infront of alot of people.
[2017-06-27 22:08:14 UTC] capstonecommune: phil is the stereotypical white american. No acountability all ego all blame all the time WAH WAH WAH
[2017-06-27 22:08:15 UTC] ubska: Maybe he did it for the frill?
[2017-06-27 22:08:15 UTC] katexo234: OSsloth
[2017-06-27 22:08:18 UTC] manajatwa123: Right Jacob! Lol
[2017-06-27 22:08:22 UTC] kingjezal: @Strelok1876 None of our business. It's HIS workplace. He's his own boss.
[2017-06-27 22:08:24 UTC] midnight_strike_force: @KingJezal I just think "he didn't schedule it" is such a funny way to say "It was an accident."
[2017-06-27 22:08:29 UTC] xthewrath93x: yeah i mean if i was a streamer and i liked to fap, the first thing id do is flip the camera upside down
[2017-06-27 22:08:29 UTC] yaslothy: OSsloth
[2017-06-27 22:08:31 UTC] deep_drive: which one of you holier than thou people here doesn't fap?
[2017-06-27 22:08:39 UTC] yaslothy: Lewd
[2017-06-27 22:08:41 UTC] obijee: Donate 5$ huh? Uh no. I'd much rather go up to a tweaking vagrant and hand him 20$ and follow him to his dealer and then proceed to watch him smoke up w/ the money I gave him. More entertaining than seeing DSP play anything xD
[2017-06-27 22:08:42 UTC] niruzi: I am doing NoFap
[2017-06-27 22:08:43 UTC] divanerasmus: i fap

[2017-06-27 22:08:47 UTC] midnight_strike_force: If you don't fap, you don't breathe.
[2017-06-27 22:08:47 UTC] yaslothy: I'm quite disgusted
[2017-06-27 22:08:52 UTC] mcismydream: I fap 24/7.
[2017-06-27 22:08:55 UTC] yaslothy: Not sure kate
[2017-06-27 22:08:56 UTC] divanerasmus: but not near as much as i used to

[2017-06-27 22:09:01 UTC] strelok1876: @KingJezal well its my business, i dont come to twitch.tv to see 35 years old guys fapping
[2017-06-27 22:09:02 UTC] nightbot: Strelok1876 -> Please don't post links. [warning]
[2017-06-27 22:09:03 UTC] xthewrath93x: i use bible verses and catch my spunk
[2017-06-27 22:09:11 UTC] yaslothy: Edgy
[2017-06-27 22:09:24 UTC] duderito2: woah careful with that edge xthewrath93x :D
[2017-06-27 22:09:24 UTC] ubska: I fap but not on webcam and live stream it, its kinda kinky to do that
[2017-06-27 22:09:27 UTC] juubeithehoobae: Phils use the Bible. Bible black that is
[2017-06-27 22:09:31 UTC] kingjezal: @xthewrath93x He didn't do it intentionally. So he's just like everyone else in that he wouldn't do it intentionally.
[2017-06-27 22:09:36 UTC] xgameofpwns: "Gay sex isn't gay" -Hutch 2011
[2017-06-27 22:09:51 UTC] strelok1876: @KingJezal its like someone getting caught fapping at the office lul , but worse , livestreaming in front of children
[2017-06-27 22:09:55 UTC] xthewrath93x: maybe dsp wanted people to see him fap, who the fuck knows
[2017-06-27 22:10:06 UTC] jacobhoward321: How do you fap unintentional?

[2017-06-27 22:10:51 UTC] xthewrath93x: dude if i fapped on camera, i'd run away to mexico and never showmy faec again
[2017-06-27 22:10:54 UTC] divanerasmus: i know this is sick bois but i really want to know what he was fapping to on stream that one time ??? who else ?
[2017-06-27 22:10:56 UTC] manajatwa123: There was nothing I could do!
[2017-06-27 22:11:00 UTC] capstonecommune: wow that rant I just heard it
[2017-06-27 22:11:09 UTC] mcismydream: DSP got on Dramalert for the fapping thing. XD
[2017-06-27 22:11:10 UTC] juubeithehoobae: He wasn't blocking the camera at that time
[2017-06-27 22:11:14 UTC] xthewrath93x: DSP is a good dude tho
[2017-06-27 22:11:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: WutFace DivanErasmus
[2017-06-27 22:11:22 UTC] capstonecommune: I have never seen a human being project that much blame on other people that obviously is referring to his own failures EVER in my entire life
[2017-06-27 22:11:25 UTC] ubska: He made national news in the UK, no joke lol

[2017-06-27 22:12:29 UTC] divanerasmus: @Ubska post me a youtube link in my wisper
[2017-06-27 22:12:35 UTC] capstonecommune: obviously his own thoughts about himself being directed towards a strawman of anonymous haters he doesnt even know
[2017-06-27 22:12:39 UTC] yaslothy: Lol kate

[2017-06-27 22:12:50 UTC] manajatwa123: DSP Tries it

[2017-06-27 22:13:15 UTC] xthewrath93x: i jerked off on a plane once, ran into the bathroom
[2017-06-27 22:13:17 UTC] xgameofpwns: Honestly, I think Phil could greatly improve his reputation if he just toned down his anger a bit...i mean he really ripped people and well-meaning viewers during the span of the past few fighting games
[2017-06-27 22:13:22 UTC] midnight_strike_force: I guess the point is, the fapping incident is something to find humour in. No need to defend someone who isn't bothered by what he did.
[2017-06-27 22:13:33 UTC] ubska: I cant wait for Danganrompa
[2017-06-27 22:13:36 UTC] uf08mycat00: Sadly never going to happen
[2017-06-27 22:13:38 UTC] juubeithehoobae: Maybe we can ask phil for music when he gets back
[2017-06-27 22:13:40 UTC] kingjezal: @mcismydream Yeah, well he didn't mean to. It was not intended to be watched or streamed. Just an honest mistake on his part.
[2017-06-27 22:13:42 UTC] theryanspark: If there was a stream full of around 400 people, I could not in good conscience fap, with the tab open.
[2017-06-27 22:13:42 UTC] uf08mycat00: I agree though
[2017-06-27 22:13:49 UTC] juubeithehoobae: @Ubska no DR2 today
[2017-06-27 22:13:49 UTC] lvlpower: Chance of Phil cam might be on his break might be 50/50

[2017-06-27 22:13:54 UTC] divanerasmus: What if ... with all the force of fapping he knocks the table of his camera and we see little PHill ?
[2017-06-27 22:13:56 UTC] deep_drive: dawngonewrongpuh :D
[2017-06-27 22:13:57 UTC] nocturnalmayhem: phil getting angry and making excuses is the best part of this stream
[2017-06-27 22:14:05 UTC] ubska: @JuubeitheHoobae its in the schedule dude
[2017-06-27 22:14:07 UTC] jacobhoward321: How is there 300 people and yet only like 10 or 20 is talking? ._.
[2017-06-27 22:14:16 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: @Xgameofpwns if he only embraced the TIHYDP videos, no negativity would of happened. just my two cents
[2017-06-27 22:14:17 UTC] midnight_strike_force: I dunno.
[2017-06-27 22:14:20 UTC] mcismydream: @DivanErasmus That would be a holy f*ck, crap just got real :O

[2017-06-27 22:14:25 UTC] juubeithehoobae: He made an executive decision not to do it
[2017-06-27 22:14:26 UTC] jacobhoward321: XD
[2017-06-27 22:14:29 UTC] kinggoken: or maybe not everyone talks
[2017-06-27 22:14:30 UTC] juubeithehoobae: at least for today

[2017-06-27 22:15:21 UTC] divanerasmus: I believe he actually got allot of good / strange publicity for his fapping not many can say that is the case for them
[2017-06-27 22:15:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: chat is crazy but at least everyone is getting along :D

[2017-06-27 22:15:41 UTC] yaslothy: @lvlpower
[2017-06-27 22:15:43 UTC] ubska: That FAP made him money, not many of us can say that
[2017-06-27 22:15:43 UTC] alexharveyconrad: Nice session. And with 0 to no trolling.
[2017-06-27 22:15:48 UTC] eternia_forever: getting along is key @theycallmejimbob
[2017-06-27 22:15:58 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: @akioartorius yeah, but it didnt do anything really...
[2017-06-27 22:15:59 UTC] midnight_strike_force: I think what he means is it was too late for him to capitalise on it, so it really doesn't mean anything.
[2017-06-27 22:16:02 UTC] jacobhoward321: I guess you can say DSP got "personal" with us. *Wink wink nudge nudge*
[2017-06-27 22:16:06 UTC] xgameofpwns: And Phil didnt even really embrace the kocc because they were very toned down
[2017-06-27 22:16:13 UTC] weiland: one fap wonder
