[2017-06-14 02:20:51 UTC] blue_blur64: I'd rather wait until he plays both 2 and Heroes before he goes into Shadow.
[2017-06-14 02:20:53 UTC] theadamlee23: I have a bad feeling though the patrons vote Shadow the Hedgehog.
[2017-06-14 02:20:57 UTC] twitchnotify: angelus72 just subscribed with Twitch Prime. angelus72 subscribed for 2 months in a row! [SubMessage]: Shits rough these days, thanks for always being there as a pick-me-up.

[2017-06-14 02:21:47 UTC] yaslothy: why not?
[2017-06-14 02:21:53 UTC] blue_blur64: Phil played both one and two before neo
[2017-06-14 02:21:53 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: gameplay
[2017-06-14 02:21:57 UTC] yaslothy: ah
[2017-06-14 02:22:11 UTC] blue_blur64: It was Heroes that was the first sonic game he skipped
[2017-06-14 02:22:22 UTC] pureo_nikku: I think it's a relatively short game unless u do chao stuff right?
[2017-06-14 02:22:25 UTC] penitence: excited for the stream tonight
[2017-06-14 02:22:35 UTC] pureo_nikku: a little difficult for me though

[2017-06-14 02:22:56 UTC] blue_blur64: If you enjoy raising chao, it could extend your gametime by such a large amount
[2017-06-14 02:22:57 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: if he plays Shadow he needs to do all the endings
[2017-06-14 02:23:00 UTC] misterfeltz: i was supposed to be going to sleep, guess i'm staying up ha

[2017-06-14 02:23:43 UTC] blue_blur64: definitely neo. But it could be a good experiment. I only see people doing specific pathways every time. Phil could do any stage at any time to make things interesting :D
[2017-06-14 02:23:48 UTC] dashxero: Good to see you, Phil.

[2017-06-14 22:36:47 UTC] yaslothy: Don't know why I said Phil
[2017-06-14 22:36:47 UTC] dasmesee: Why would anyone get a new Xbox when you can just get it on pc?
[2017-06-14 22:36:49 UTC] deep_drive: Beautiful dashboard sounds on PS4 bobbi
[2017-06-14 22:36:49 UTC] betheallen: or the shitty BACKWARDS broken piece of garbage
[2017-06-14 22:36:50 UTC] tyronegordo: morrowind for xbox at that

[2017-06-14 22:37:47 UTC] dkmariolink: I'm recent with everyone else
[2017-06-14 22:37:47 UTC] deep_drive: Sorry for saying you are always wrong bobbi, I shouldn't have said that
[2017-06-14 22:37:47 UTC] wilhelm_der_eroberer: This Eliza is terrible
[2017-06-14 22:37:54 UTC] betheallen: bobbi and that is why i got my ps3
[2017-06-14 22:37:56 UTC] dkmariolink: decent
[2017-06-14 22:37:56 UTC] jesterkl: I can play morrowind on my microwave
[2017-06-14 22:38:01 UTC] xhackz666: If what Anthem featured was right, there is no computer for 500$ which can keep up on 4k resolution with those graphics and without loading screens. but... i honestly think that it was a scripted "gameplay"
[2017-06-14 22:38:07 UTC] tyronegordo: @clinical_rage it'd still be better than trying to play the old console port with a fucking controller MingLee
[2017-06-14 22:38:07 UTC] quertyalt255: lol destroyed
[2017-06-14 22:38:10 UTC] yaslothy: It's good to apologize deep. I have learned that these past few days.

[2017-06-14 22:38:59 UTC] yaslothy: I'm with ya there buddy.
[2017-06-14 22:39:07 UTC] tyronegordo: nobody give a fuck about skyrim anymore, stop shilling it

[2017-06-14 22:39:47 UTC] adentros: XD rage time
[2017-06-14 22:39:51 UTC] gundamite: only won cause of random moves, fucking douchebag
[2017-06-14 22:39:53 UTC] astralabstraction: Because Morrowind Remaster won't sell anywhere enar as well
[2017-06-14 22:39:53 UTC] wilhelm_der_eroberer: Nothing wrong with the connection lol
[2017-06-14 22:39:55 UTC] jesterkl: Todd Howard is a dumb idiot
[2017-06-14 22:40:06 UTC] betheallen: bobbi i wouldve been on morrowind remaster
[2017-06-14 22:40:14 UTC] betheallen: skyrim vr fuck off
[2017-06-14 22:40:18 UTC] yaslothy: You hate Morrowind.
[2017-06-14 22:40:19 UTC] tyronegordo: a remaster of morrowind would sell like fucking hot cakes
[2017-06-14 22:40:22 UTC] dkmariolink: Todd is NOT dumb nor an idiot, but he is a liar.
[2017-06-14 22:40:23 UTC] astralabstraction: Not really
[2017-06-14 22:40:24 UTC] yaslothy: You said so yourself.

[2017-06-14 22:40:46 UTC] yaslothy: FailFish
[2017-06-14 22:40:47 UTC] cabledark: noice
[2017-06-14 22:40:51 UTC] tyronegordo: you don't realize how many nostalgia fegs out there that would buy that game in a heart beat
[2017-06-14 22:40:54 UTC] eternal2911: Anybody know if DSP plays on a arcade stick for this?
[2017-06-14 22:40:56 UTC] astralabstraction: Morrowind will sell well to a niche audience, but people in general aren't as interested in it as you might think
[2017-06-14 22:41:01 UTC] dkmariolink: @eternal2911 pad
[2017-06-14 22:41:03 UTC] spazz3: he's using pad
[2017-06-14 22:41:09 UTC] wilhelm_der_eroberer: @DarksydePhil after ff3~f either 1,2 or 3+4

[2017-06-14 22:41:36 UTC] betheallen: piss4*
[2017-06-14 22:41:44 UTC] tyronegordo: I'd honestly doubt that, Morrowind was popular as fuck when it released too. A remaster would likely do well.
[2017-06-14 22:41:47 UTC] astralabstraction: Also, you'd have to completely overhaul Morrowind's gameplay to have hopes of selling it in 2017
[2017-06-14 22:41:53 UTC] guccikodak: @DarksydePhil i still think ur best with king u were just in a bad matchup with josie
[2017-06-14 22:42:02 UTC] betheallen: i wont sacrifice my playstation sloth im sorry
[2017-06-14 22:42:03 UTC] zebefreo: lol always humble in victory gracious in defeat Kappa
[2017-06-14 22:42:08 UTC] tyronegordo: That's the only thing, the dice roll combat.
[2017-06-14 22:42:08 UTC] iamtheluckyyo: to slow
[2017-06-14 22:42:09 UTC] astralabstraction: It would do well, but not Skyrim numbers
[2017-06-14 22:42:12 UTC] yaslothy: alright
[2017-06-14 22:42:20 UTC] blaccnredd: you can dash off the ff+3f (hold)
[2017-06-14 22:42:26 UTC] tyronegordo: Nothing is going to do Skyrim numbers except for their next release.
[2017-06-14 22:42:27 UTC] betheallen: sloth would you sacrifice your pc?
[2017-06-14 22:42:48 UTC] jesterkl: @DarksydePhil What ya think of yoshimitsu in this game?
[2017-06-14 22:42:49 UTC] tyronegordo: Skyrim numbers are retarded at this point, especially after what 6 years of shilling?
[2017-06-14 22:42:51 UTC] blaccnredd: so like ff+3f (hold), 12 to end the combo
[2017-06-14 22:42:52 UTC] yaslothy: well I'd just keep the PC and get another console
[2017-06-14 22:42:55 UTC] blaccnredd: yeah like that
[2017-06-14 22:42:57 UTC] yaslothy: for whatever I need it for.
[2017-06-14 22:43:10 UTC] silver_ogre: I think you're doing it too fast
[2017-06-14 22:43:11 UTC] vendatus: hope I can get to play that dbfighterz more tomorrow SeemsGood
[2017-06-14 22:43:19 UTC] betheallen: but you cant afford that shit
[2017-06-14 22:43:25 UTC] iamtheluckyyo: use kicks
[2017-06-14 22:43:27 UTC] yaslothy: what are you saying
[2017-06-14 22:43:33 UTC] wilhelm_der_eroberer: @DarksydePhil 3+4 after the dash for wall carry. And you can do a wall grab after wall splat
[2017-06-14 22:43:57 UTC] astralabstraction: That's why Skyrim VR isn't actually a bad idea. People have been looking for big, fully developed games for VR. People will play a 6 year old game for that just out of desperation
[2017-06-14 22:44:03 UTC] blaccnredd: go back to neutral after the the dash, 12
[2017-06-14 22:44:05 UTC] betheallen: sloth if someone took all your pc things whilst you were a sleep what would you do without them
[2017-06-14 22:44:12 UTC] lijn0001: It's 1, 2 after the ff3 phil imGlitch

[2017-06-14 22:44:45 UTC] yaslothy: personal insults
[2017-06-14 22:44:49 UTC] astralabstraction: Personally I'm sick of Skyrim's shallow gameplay myself
[2017-06-14 22:44:51 UTC] tyronegordo: I still want to know who the fuck hasn't played this game after 6 years though, shit is fucking dead
[2017-06-14 22:45:01 UTC] kidwoohda: Skyrim isnt that good to begin with IMO
[2017-06-14 22:45:09 UTC] jesterkl: ↑

[2017-06-14 22:45:11 UTC] tiefblaux17: I'd like to pick up a switch but the practices companies do now with intentionally limiting their stock to artificially increase interest is BS
[2017-06-14 22:45:12 UTC] tyronegordo: same, and I agree kid
[2017-06-14 22:45:14 UTC] vendatus: tbh Cherd probably has more money than you atm bethe Kappa

[2017-06-14 22:45:26 UTC] zebefreo: tbh is not that special, some ppl prefer the previpus one
[2017-06-14 22:45:27 UTC] astralabstraction: you say that, but I'm sure Skyrim will do well on Switch
[2017-06-14 22:45:31 UTC] iamtheluckyyo: good phil

[2017-06-14 23:33:00 UTC] wilhelm_der_eroberer: @siegmare most definitely. I'm just really saying that you can alter the general playstyle of a character if you absolutely know everything about what your and your opponent's character does. Most Asuka players I've seen struggle in a lot of situations so to most people, yeah she's trash to their playstyle lol. People claim her to be a defensive character but I seem to be one of the few who's successful playing offensively without abusing basic BS.
