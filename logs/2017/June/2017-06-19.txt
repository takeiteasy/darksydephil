[2017-06-19 18:28:03 UTC] betheallen: good pc deserve to wait
[2017-06-19 18:28:09 UTC] yaslothy: Oh boy.
[2017-06-19 18:28:26 UTC] yaslothy: No all consoles and PC games deserve to come out at the same time.
[2017-06-19 18:28:35 UTC] betheallen: true
[2017-06-19 18:28:51 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: I had a rough night's sleep too, was too hot and I kept waking up throughout the night (that was despite Persona 5 putting me to sleep, cure for insomnia that is lol). Despite my rough night, and also sleeping in a bit,, I still made sure to be at work by 8am as usual.

[2017-06-19 18:30:58 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: some comments to Phil's tweet btw include things such as: Your immune system is shot, you need to vacuum the house and start drinking lemon tea
[2017-06-19 18:31:38 UTC] theycallmejimbob: dunno about the lemon tea bit, but his office could do with a bit of a dusting
[2017-06-19 18:31:45 UTC] auzziesly47adam: the room is Kappa
[2017-06-19 18:32:15 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: what is, Phil's room or you answering @YaSlothy movie quote?

[2017-06-19 18:33:44 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: can't wait to call his immune system fucking lazy for not turning out enough to stop him from getting sick
[2017-06-19 18:33:54 UTC] yaslothy: Any of you use a tea caddy?
[2017-06-19 18:34:02 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: no, for I do not drink tea

[2017-06-19 18:34:33 UTC] yaslothy: yes
[2017-06-19 18:35:45 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: Phil should invest on a roomba or whatever to vacuum for him, maybe get 2 of them so one takes care or upstairs and one takes care of downstairs
[2017-06-19 18:36:24 UTC] yaslothy: lol
[2017-06-19 18:36:43 UTC] yaslothy: or just clean at night when he's got free time.
[2017-06-19 18:36:54 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: he has no free time, barely, he cannot stress this enough
[2017-06-19 18:37:02 UTC] yaslothy: DBstyle
[2017-06-19 18:37:04 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: ignore the fact he watched a whole WWE ppv the other night
[2017-06-19 18:37:11 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: free time is at a premium for Phil
[2017-06-19 18:37:23 UTC] yaslothy: This is good tea. OSsloth
[2017-06-19 18:37:52 UTC] yaslothy: tbh vacuuming takes about 15 mins tops
[2017-06-19 18:38:02 UTC] yaslothy: Makes you feel good after too.
[2017-06-19 18:38:28 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: so does editing an intro and outro for a pre-edited video for KO Gaming before you hit render. For Phil some things just take substantially longer, somehow
[2017-06-19 18:38:41 UTC] betheallen: you know that terrible tall block fire, well 79 people confirmed dead now :( still might be more
[2017-06-19 18:38:47 UTC] auzziesly47adam: Tommy Wiseau'st his man knows how to make a movie Kappa

[2017-06-19 18:39:14 UTC] philtheboss2367: Where's Phil
[2017-06-19 18:39:19 UTC] betheallen: and some idiot ran over like 7 muslims, dumb terrorist

[2017-06-19 18:39:50 UTC] yaslothy: Jesus

[2017-06-19 18:41:20 UTC] capstonecommune: if you mean terrorism its the zzionist jews and america screwing over muslims to expand israel and oil profits
[2017-06-19 18:41:22 UTC] auzziesly47adam: there's nothing we could do to stop it
[2017-06-19 18:41:38 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: @starlordxz let's talk. What do you want to talk about?
[2017-06-19 18:41:41 UTC] betheallen: what i dont understand is why a guy with a family and a wife who helps out hid neighbours and is from wales would go to london to run over 7 muslims as a act or terrorism
[2017-06-19 18:41:43 UTC] capstonecommune: put a wire on a jew and send em in ill get you your evidence
[2017-06-19 18:41:53 UTC] capstonecommune: terrorism doesnt benefit muslims
[2017-06-19 18:42:03 UTC] yaslothy: Here we go.

[2017-06-19 18:47:33 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: it's not new though, when you boil it down to what it is - people being cunts to other people. Humanity is fucking poisonous at times, and the actions of a small few can have huge consequences for the many. It's always been this way, for centuries
[2017-06-19 18:48:29 UTC] capstonecommune: mandatory minimums for non violent drug offences and child porn are being enforced in america now

[2017-06-19 18:52:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey dela
[2017-06-19 18:52:20 UTC] theycallmejimbob: delta even
[2017-06-19 18:52:28 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: food for thought: do you think Phil would be happier if he sold Seattle home and moved back home? He'd be near family for instance.
[2017-06-19 18:52:29 UTC] betheallen: hey delta
[2017-06-19 18:52:47 UTC] capstonecommune: phil should hire interns or room mates

[2017-06-19 18:53:16 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: of course
[2017-06-19 18:53:27 UTC] auzziesly47adam: USF2 Good :D
[2017-06-19 18:53:30 UTC] capstonecommune: yeah MITB was wack wrestling is wack when theres no cool debuts to expect
[2017-06-19 18:53:31 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: why cant just he go to the doctor?
[2017-06-19 18:53:44 UTC] capstonecommune: costs too much
[2017-06-19 18:53:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Didn't he mention in a recent vlog about house prices in his area rising the whole time and he wants to sit on it and sell the house as a last resort so I presume that's his M.O. hotsauce
[2017-06-19 18:53:52 UTC] capstonecommune: America is late stage capitalist
[2017-06-19 18:54:13 UTC] capstonecommune: everything aint worth its price and if it is its too expensive and meant for somebody richer than you
[2017-06-19 18:54:29 UTC] capstonecommune: i went to get x ray pay 200$ they dont even show it to me
[2017-06-19 18:54:34 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: but the value can go down as well as up, and there's no guarantees of getting the same price as the one being evaluated for the area - it can depend on how well you maintain your own home.
[2017-06-19 18:54:36 UTC] capstonecommune: capitalism
[2017-06-19 18:55:01 UTC] capstonecommune: phil should create a team
[2017-06-19 18:55:07 UTC] capstonecommune: fill those empty rooms
[2017-06-19 18:55:28 UTC] capstonecommune: editor and graphic designer would be good combo
[2017-06-19 18:55:33 UTC] baldingsimulator: pushing back my stream times further than my hairline ack ack ack ack
[2017-06-19 18:55:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: that's true hotsauce but I think the thought crossed his mind about moving back and that's his rationale for staying
[2017-06-19 18:56:03 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: wow bethe
[2017-06-19 18:56:06 UTC] capstonecommune: the Ct condo is more economic the house he has now he better make some friends and fast cuz he dont need all that shit

[2017-06-19 18:59:02 UTC] capstonecommune: he needs to be sponsored by v8
[2017-06-19 18:59:25 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: its weird that he needs V8 just to play games
[2017-06-19 18:59:39 UTC] capstonecommune: just call them up and say "500 ppl watch me a day and every day i drink v8 energy drinks. Every day 500 ppl see that logo what can we work out?"
[2017-06-19 18:59:41 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: well he needs it to wake up

[2017-06-19 19:00:23 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: see
[2017-06-19 19:00:42 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: water is the best drink in my opinion in the morning, start with a nice big glass of it

[2017-06-19 19:17:24 UTC] mozoyvr: But GTA2, although fun, does feel antiquated. Tank controls and the like, but it still is fun to mess about.
[2017-06-19 19:17:37 UTC] auzziesly47adam: Good you and yes i am jimbob :)

[2017-06-19 19:20:20 UTC] 0megaj0ker: has Phil played Evil Ryu online?
[2017-06-19 19:20:21 UTC] mozoyvr: Volition has a good record, though.
[2017-06-19 19:20:25 UTC] derichloveslemur: @theycallmejimbob USF2 is such a fun game for Phil to play right?
[2017-06-19 19:20:45 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: when he wins....
