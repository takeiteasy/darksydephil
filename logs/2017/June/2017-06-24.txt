[2017-06-24 01:25:20 UTC] shalashaska994: I think if he actually watched those metal gear videos of himself it'd do a lot of good for his mental health. Someone like that needs to be confronted with his problems in order to work on them.
[2017-06-24 01:27:11 UTC] ganbare_gincun: If only....
[2017-06-24 01:27:21 UTC] ganbare_gincun: Does anyone know what mic DSP uses for recording?
[2017-06-24 01:30:24 UTC] 6th_moral: DSP is fully aware of the detractor videos.
[2017-06-24 01:31:13 UTC] 6th_moral: He has even been toying around with the idea of doing a redemption run of Metal Gear Solid 3 like he did with Dark Souls, but nothing is set in stone at all.
[2017-06-24 02:04:18 UTC] shalashaska994: It has very little to do with the game itself and everything to do with mental health. All the times where he makes mistakes yet blames everything on the game and accepts no responsibility. In my professional opinion, it's textbook sociopothy.

[2017-06-24 02:35:27 UTC] derichloveslemur: @thirdeyethethird you should check out One Punch-man great manga.

[2017-06-24 02:35:58 UTC] darksydephil: Elipsion if you can find a way to convince the Japanese branch of Atlus to stop stupidly giving out false copyright strikes against playthroughs, then be my guest lol
[2017-06-24 02:36:04 UTC] darksydephil: nobody seems to know what their problem is
[2017-06-24 02:36:33 UTC] 6th_moral: after the Atlus strike was confirmed an error does that mean Persona 5 playthrough still called off?
[2017-06-24 02:36:36 UTC] derichloveslemur: @darksydephil Sucks that you had to deal with some guy earlier when you came back from break.
[2017-06-24 02:36:36 UTC] thirdeyethethird: @Derichloveslemur I've seen a few episodes of that actually, but I'm not into that sort of stuff

[2017-06-24 02:38:06 UTC] thirdeyethethird: i just wasn't sure what manga was exactly

My thesis is that Hitler & Nazi beliefs are carried on by twitch tv Nazi moderators who like to act as if they themselves were literally Hitler. I think I should score at least 90 out of 100 points for that paper.

"I wish I never ghosted" says a heavily drunk Hosty as he notices a dark figure behind him."I can give you your life back as long as you do something for me" says Amaz. Hosty knowing what Amaz wants bends over and lets him have his way. Afterwards as he cries on bed, Amaz whispers in his ear "I lied. Again""//

[2017-06-24 22:17:49 UTC] chairmancaleb: @theycallmejimbob, They're not very bright. You're rating the game as a negative instead of writing to the higher ups who aren't allowing it anymore. The game itself is great way before mods were introduced. This does nothing but tell people who haven't played it yet (which are few to be fair) that the game sucks.
[2017-06-24 22:17:49 UTC] d1mech: lol @stuart360
[2017-06-24 22:18:03 UTC] pr34ch: Ginosaji8 wich one eh :-)

[2017-06-24 22:18:53 UTC] yaslothy: @d1mech ah no worries, half of the bans were probably my fault.

[2017-06-24 22:19:18 UTC] 6th_moral: @Great_Aether Because he only calls the detractors morons? And because some people LIKE his gameplay and commentary?

[2017-06-24 22:19:57 UTC] great_aether: He calls his regular donators morons. He's even banned patrons. So it's not just "detractors."

[2017-06-24 22:21:18 UTC] darksydephil: it has nothing to do with the mic
[2017-06-24 22:21:23 UTC] chairmancaleb: @great_aether, Being a patron doesn't give you free reign to insult and do a bunch of other crap.

[2017-06-24 22:21:44 UTC] stuart360: The mentality is that most of us fans are intelligent to realize when Phil is frustrayted and its just frustration talking. In you detractors could realize this, maybe you wouldn't hate him so much

[2017-06-24 23:58:46 UTC] 6th_moral: @DarksydePhil Looking at the map, you need to head to the more spacious area (closest to Plata Grande to the East) with three black squares. Inside this area is a camp, in which the tent on the far east side contains the scrap in a chest.
