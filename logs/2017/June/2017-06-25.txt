[2017-06-25 17:07:59 UTC] xthewrath93x: you see the house tour?
[2017-06-25 17:08:11 UTC] sanguinenite: I have been more or less inactive ever since phil is doing his RDR redux, which I think is a waste of time. Why replay a game when there are so many other games to play. and to your question - yes I did. :)
[2017-06-25 17:08:47 UTC] xthewrath93x: just voted for DBD, RDR is winning by a landslide :/
[2017-06-25 17:09:06 UTC] sanguinenite: I burst out laughing at one point. It was hilarious when I saw it. Oh FXXX oh well thanks for trying.
[2017-06-25 17:09:52 UTC] sanguinenite: I do not get the appeal of another RDR LP, I believe the majority of the votes are by the trolls
[2017-06-25 17:10:01 UTC] xthewrath93x: RDR is so boring
[2017-06-25 17:10:12 UTC] xthewrath93x: the house tour was depressing. him all alone in that house
[2017-06-25 17:10:16 UTC] sanguinenite: Phil is actually pretty okay at DBD so it wouldnt do for the trolls to not have videos for their TIHYDP
[2017-06-25 17:10:39 UTC] xthewrath93x: someone called it 'Forever alone Art exibit' LUL
[2017-06-25 17:10:44 UTC] sanguinenite: I laughed so hard when I saw the table full of fastfood coupons I am not a hater but when I saw that, I laughed.

[2017-06-25 17:13:00 UTC] sanguinenite: I truly believe that RDR is being voted by the trolls. I agree that RDR is boring af
[2017-06-25 17:14:00 UTC] xthewrath93x: why doesnt he play
[2017-06-25 17:14:03 UTC] xthewrath93x: H1Z1or something
[2017-06-25 17:14:11 UTC] sanguinenite: Hopefully that the xbone system crashes and is unable to play RDR for whatever reason. DBD is much more interesting to watch/ What is H1Z1?
[2017-06-25 17:18:00 UTC] xthewrath93x: its so good
[2017-06-25 17:18:04 UTC] xthewrath93x: its basically battle royale
[2017-06-25 17:18:09 UTC] xthewrath93x: its on twitch, dsp should do it
[2017-06-25 17:19:56 UTC] sanguinenite: its an mmo?
[2017-06-25 17:20:26 UTC] xthewrath93x: ye
[2017-06-25 17:20:40 UTC] xthewrath93x: it would be different but DSP is doin the same shit constantly
[2017-06-25 17:20:49 UTC] xthewrath93x: nobody asked for RDR
[2017-06-25 17:21:41 UTC] sanguinenite: I think he is replaying it only because it requires no effort on his part because he knows the mechanics of it, nobody wants RDR except for the TIHYDP people
[2017-06-25 17:24:22 UTC] xthewrath93x: this streams were getting so many viewers

[2017-06-25 17:52:11 UTC] sanguinenite: if you make a comment that he thinks is insulting and even if you tip, he wont read your comment and ban/delete your message

[2017-06-25 17:57:30 UTC] poochie__: I'd probably never donate anyways
[2017-06-25 17:57:50 UTC] poochie__: Phil's doing a good job of blaming others for his sinking ship anyways
[2017-06-25 17:58:02 UTC] sanguinenite: I wasnt talking to you I was just saying it for everyone else in the chat lurking
[2017-06-25 17:58:03 UTC] poochie__: And a few dollars won't make any difference
[2017-06-25 17:58:44 UTC] sanguinenite: even so donating a dollar to a business isnt the brightest thing to do if you want it to go out of business, just saying xD
[2017-06-25 17:59:25 UTC] poochie__: This is true for like Kaceytron, innit
[2017-06-25 17:59:53 UTC] poochie__: Who's huge because people like to go there and hate on her
[2017-06-25 18:00:00 UTC] poochie__: And she doesn't ban those people that tip huge
[2017-06-25 18:00:03 UTC] poochie__: Not as far as I know
[2017-06-25 18:00:16 UTC] poochie__: But that's a character anyways
[2017-06-25 18:00:40 UTC] leonaras: Well phil is basically Kaceytron with a beard

[2017-06-25 18:38:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: well he got up to around 500 dollars and left the table on 220 or so dollars

[2017-06-25 18:39:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the A.I cheats :D
[2017-06-25 18:39:16 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: I've been playing for years but still, it's an easy game to play especially in RDR
[2017-06-25 18:39:17 UTC] betheallen: texas hold em?
[2017-06-25 18:39:23 UTC] yaslothy: Interesting emotes jimmy.
[2017-06-25 18:39:24 UTC] sanguinenite: D: No I want DBD
[2017-06-25 18:39:34 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: that's the form of poker in RDR. There are many different kinds of poker you can play lol
[2017-06-25 18:39:36 UTC] sanguinenite: please may phil's xbox die
[2017-06-25 18:39:40 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: the most common is Texas Hold'Em
[2017-06-25 18:40:21 UTC] betheallen: how jimmy get those emotes
[2017-06-25 18:40:25 UTC] betheallen: the fuck
[2017-06-25 18:40:55 UTC] betheallen: red dead redemption is better than dead by daylight
[2017-06-25 18:41:01 UTC] sanguinenite: really?
[2017-06-25 18:41:14 UTC] xthewrath93x: i think RDR is the better game to play, but to watch its DBD
[2017-06-25 18:41:21 UTC] sanguinenite: ^^^
[2017-06-25 18:41:22 UTC] xthewrath93x: this playthru is a little boring
[2017-06-25 18:41:29 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: ikr
[2017-06-25 18:41:40 UTC] sanguinenite: And not to mention, RDR has already been completed by phil before
[2017-06-25 18:41:58 UTC] sanguinenite: Why is phil wasting time with games he already finished?
[2017-06-25 18:42:10 UTC] yaslothy: Just play fuckin' Buck Bumble.
[2017-06-25 18:42:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it's the calm before the storm known as DS2 SOTFS
[2017-06-25 18:42:21 UTC] betheallen: sanguinite so i want HD red dead not shitty camera in front of tv quality
[2017-06-25 18:42:32 UTC] betheallen: lol sloth
[2017-06-25 18:42:57 UTC] yaslothy: 24 hour marathon of Buck Bumble and Beetle Adventure Racing.
[2017-06-25 18:42:58 UTC] xthewrath93x: bethe i think what hes saying is, RDR has a lot of down time of doing nothing
[2017-06-25 18:43:04 UTC] sanguinenite: eh even with the HD, the game doesnt get all that much more interesting to watch. DBD is far superior in terms of excitement for viewers
[2017-06-25 18:43:15 UTC] betheallen: sloth yaaaaassss Kreygasm
[2017-06-25 18:43:16 UTC] xthewrath93x: DBD is tense and a much better streaming game.
[2017-06-25 18:43:23 UTC] xthewrath93x: but its losing in the polls LOL
[2017-06-25 18:43:56 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: it's an interesting point. It's a great game, RDR, but as a stream there's a lot of quiet boring bits in between those great parts
[2017-06-25 18:44:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I think if FT13 had to be in the running
[2017-06-25 18:44:05 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it would of won
[2017-06-25 18:44:20 UTC] betheallen: dead by daylight none wants to watch that is why its losing
[2017-06-25 18:44:32 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: what is the current pole score? and how many voted?
[2017-06-25 18:44:36 UTC] yaslothy: How many people voted.
[2017-06-25 18:44:43 UTC] yaslothy: ?
[2017-06-25 18:45:02 UTC] betheallen: !twitter
[2017-06-25 18:45:03 UTC] nightbot: Follow me on Twitter! http://www.twitter.com/theycallmedsp
[2017-06-25 18:45:09 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: I believe that any polls that get a certain number of votes, Phil disputes them as being trustworthy due to fear of detractors influencing vote
[2017-06-25 18:45:20 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: he said that in past
[2017-06-25 18:45:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah you're referring to executive decisions he made in the past hotsauce
[2017-06-25 18:46:04 UTC] sanguinenite: I hope he believes it is because the trolls voted for RDR for more TIHYDP content for their montages
[2017-06-25 18:46:04 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: yes
[2017-06-25 18:46:09 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: then whats the point of the vote if phil is going to choose the game he wants anyway
[2017-06-25 18:46:24 UTC] xthewrath93x: if rdr is such a better game why does DBD get more viewers
[2017-06-25 18:46:27 UTC] betheallen: no i voted for red dead redemption
[2017-06-25 18:46:33 UTC] xthewrath93x: its not a better stream game than DBD
[2017-06-25 18:46:37 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: holy shit 670 votes? Yeah that's more than usual
[2017-06-25 18:46:42 UTC] yaslothy: lol executive decisions
[2017-06-25 18:46:43 UTC] betheallen: so why would the trolls vote for it
[2017-06-25 18:47:08 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: Phil tweeted 5 minutes ago btw
[2017-06-25 18:47:11 UTC] betheallen: i am enjoying all the red dead redemption streams
[2017-06-25 18:47:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: rdr is winning 57 to 43 btw for those that don't have a twitter account
[2017-06-25 18:47:15 UTC] sanguinenite: TIHYDP content? and not to mention, phil did pretty good/better than playing DBD.
[2017-06-25 18:47:28 UTC] yaslothy: I'd argue that RDR is a much better game. But people like online salt so it gets more viewers.
[2017-06-25 18:47:29 UTC] betheallen: dead by daylight was getting boring after a few matches
[2017-06-25 18:47:41 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: @YaSlothy yup
[2017-06-25 18:47:42 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: 'unless a voting miracle happens in the next 20 minutes, it looks like more Red Dead Redemption on stream today!' - so no executive decision this time, despite the large votes
[2017-06-25 18:47:45 UTC] yaslothy: Salt = more trolls and legit viewers alike
[2017-06-25 18:47:49 UTC] yaslothy: Pretty simple.
[2017-06-25 18:47:52 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: thats why we watch phil anyway @YaSlothy
[2017-06-25 18:48:02 UTC] yaslothy: Well... Kappa
[2017-06-25 18:48:04 UTC] sanguinenite: eh difference in personal opinion bethe no offense
[2017-06-25 18:48:14 UTC] betheallen: sloth and you get more salt in dead by daylight so they would vote for that
[2017-06-25 18:48:30 UTC] yaslothy: Yes, as I stated.
[2017-06-25 18:49:15 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I wouldn't call it salt I would call it factual observations made in an aggressive manner
[2017-06-25 18:49:28 UTC] yaslothy: Sure OpieOP
[2017-06-25 18:49:32 UTC] sanguinenite: I find online games better but thats just my opinion and after phil muted the party chat, the salt shouldnt be so bad
[2017-06-25 18:49:54 UTC] xthewrath93x: im shocked by the voting in all honestly, i wouldnt of thought DBD would of won
[2017-06-25 18:49:59 UTC] xthewrath93x: RDR^
[2017-06-25 18:50:07 UTC] sanguinenite: sandbox games are sooo boring
[2017-06-25 18:50:30 UTC] betheallen: online games are boring as fuck to play
[2017-06-25 18:50:38 UTC] yaslothy: Oh boy.
[2017-06-25 18:50:43 UTC] betheallen: gimme single player games
[2017-06-25 18:50:50 UTC] theycallmejimbob: there was a few saying they prefer ft13 to dbd and found dbd boring so maybe that's why the vote for rdr is so high
[2017-06-25 18:51:04 UTC] yaslothy: Fight. Swift
[2017-06-25 18:51:07 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: it's not exactly a landslide of a vote - there's been 670 votes. RDR is winning by almost 3/5 of the vote - so around 360 votes. But there are still over 2/5 of Phil's audience wanting DBD. That's still a lot of folk
[2017-06-25 18:51:11 UTC] yaslothy: SwiftRage
[2017-06-25 18:51:16 UTC] sanguinenite: lol I am not about to go into an arguement but I will say this. When I bought any Assassin's Creed game I only played less than 10% of the single player
[2017-06-25 18:51:35 UTC] leonaras: Clearly have ADD sanguine.
[2017-06-25 18:51:37 UTC] leonaras: Kappa
[2017-06-25 18:51:40 UTC] sanguinenite: I played the f out of the multiplayer, fun as anything

[2017-06-25 18:52:55 UTC] betheallen: mp of assassins creed was not that great though
[2017-06-25 18:53:13 UTC] sanguinenite: I got 9star prestige on the multiplayer, fun as anything else, even got top 100 before
[2017-06-25 18:53:44 UTC] xthewrath93x: i play ass creed for the story
[2017-06-25 18:53:45 UTC] leonaras: @SanguineNite whos that then Kappa
[2017-06-25 18:54:00 UTC] sanguinenite: @Leonaras from your little group of course Kappa
[2017-06-25 18:54:03 UTC] xthewrath93x: but for watching someone stream i'd go DBD/FT13 over RDR
[2017-06-25 18:54:11 UTC] sanguinenite: ^^^^^
[2017-06-25 18:54:18 UTC] leonaras: Surely everyone is part of this group :O we are watching phil
[2017-06-25 18:54:47 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: I think @SanguineNite ought to be careful with these hateful comments towards viewers, Phil may not take kindly to it - he's had enough of it these days
[2017-06-25 18:54:58 UTC] sanguinenite: uh no, only a minority would stalk the shit out of phil to your levels @Leonaras XD, way to go supporting phil
[2017-06-25 18:55:24 UTC] sanguinenite: lol if phil bans me sure, it is not like I was never banned before xD
[2017-06-25 18:55:31 UTC] xthewrath93x: @SanguineNite LUL
[2017-06-25 18:55:45 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: wow dood
[2017-06-25 18:55:55 UTC] yaslothy: DansGame
[2017-06-25 18:56:10 UTC] sanguinenite: I am very honest like phil, if he feel offended it is his right to feel offended
[2017-06-25 18:56:11 UTC] yaslothy: *puts on headphones and tries to stay out of it*
[2017-06-25 18:56:37 UTC] xthewrath93x: why does DSP even need a poll
[2017-06-25 18:56:47 UTC] xthewrath93x: he should know himself that more people watch DBD over
[2017-06-25 18:56:48 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: @SanguineNite how so. u just stated your opinion
[2017-06-25 18:56:48 UTC] xthewrath93x: RDR
[2017-06-25 18:57:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: listening to some tom waits YaSlothy ?
[2017-06-25 18:57:20 UTC] sanguinenite: I dont care, I said it as fact, deal with it B)
[2017-06-25 18:57:31 UTC] yaslothy: @theycallmejimbob Sufjan Stevens at the moment B)
[2017-06-25 18:57:56 UTC] yaslothy: before that; Owen Pallet, before that; Life Without Buildings B)
[2017-06-25 18:58:05 UTC] leonaras: @SanguineNite My levels? Such an accusation. Some would say based on your topic of conversation that you are more obsessed.
[2017-06-25 18:58:13 UTC] xthewrath93x: ooooo dramaaaaa
[2017-06-25 18:58:19 UTC] yaslothy: Kreygasm
[2017-06-25 18:59:06 UTC] sanguinenite: lol the trolls want to try to trigger me, have fun asking to questions I wont entertain Kappa
[2017-06-25 18:59:21 UTC] leonaras: Thanks for entertaining it :P
[2017-06-25 18:59:41 UTC] xthewrath93x: @SanguineNite dont worry about the stans,
[2017-06-25 19:00:46 UTC] sanguinenite: The mods should really keep a record of all the tips done by trolls
[2017-06-25 19:01:14 UTC] sanguinenite: I am sure it is over 500 dollars at this point, not even counting cheers on twitch
[2017-06-25 19:01:40 UTC] blue_blur64: Uh, our job isn't to deal with money given to Phil xD
[2017-06-25 19:01:47 UTC] yaslothy: Well to be fair, if someone is a troll and you hate Phil, they probably should avoid giving him money.
[2017-06-25 19:02:02 UTC] xthewrath93x: if you hate phil why would you give him money lmao
[2017-06-25 19:02:05 UTC] sanguinenite: well you should, we should know how much phil's gotten richer over ADHD patients
[2017-06-25 19:02:19 UTC] yaslothy: If people really want to see Phil go away then just don't give him money.
[2017-06-25 19:02:35 UTC] xthewrath93x: i never thought to my selfoh i hate thuis person grrrrlet me give him some money!
[2017-06-25 19:02:37 UTC] blue_blur64: So I learned some more about Atlus's sudden mass copyright strike situation
[2017-06-25 19:02:37 UTC] yaslothy: This coming from someone who sees both sides.
[2017-06-25 19:02:53 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: @blue_blur64 tell us
[2017-06-25 19:02:59 UTC] sanguinenite: It might be a selling point for new viewers to feel better about their lives knowing that there are in fact such losers that tip someone they hate XD
[2017-06-25 19:03:16 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeah @YaSlothy the obvious truth to anyone with half a brain
[2017-06-25 19:03:17 UTC] blue_blur64: Well from what I've seen, most of the strikes deal with the main battle theme, Last Surprise
[2017-06-25 19:03:28 UTC] theycallmejimbob: You'll never see it coming SwiftRage
[2017-06-25 19:03:35 UTC] blue_blur64: Phil is a very rare case with what happened to him
[2017-06-25 19:03:37 UTC] yaslothy: DansGame
[2017-06-25 19:03:37 UTC] sanguinenite: lol youtube has videos with only that song and they havent been taken down
[2017-06-25 19:03:44 UTC] yaslothy: lol a song
[2017-06-25 19:03:45 UTC] sanguinenite: I am sure the trolls had something to do with it
[2017-06-25 19:03:46 UTC] blue_blur64: actually some have sanguine
[2017-06-25 19:03:50 UTC] xthewrath93x: must be a detractor at atlus
[2017-06-25 19:04:21 UTC] theycallmejimbob: didn't he say the vids that got the strike he was just fusing persona? Does that song play for that Silent?
[2017-06-25 19:04:31 UTC] sanguinenite: lol detractor as atlus coffee servers unhappy about their life, try to take down phil
[2017-06-25 19:04:45 UTC] betheallen: starbuckteeth is streaming

[2017-06-25 19:04:56 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: @theycallmejimbob it plays the velvet room theme when fusing personas
[2017-06-25 19:04:57 UTC] yaslothy: ok bethe
[2017-06-25 19:04:59 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: also hi there
[2017-06-25 19:05:05 UTC] blue_blur64: Fubuta Magica got a strike on the video that played Last Surprise, just the song and nothing else
[2017-06-25 19:05:06 UTC] xthewrath93x: did anybody else feel a bit sad for DSP during that house tour?
[2017-06-25 19:05:19 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: why?
[2017-06-25 19:05:25 UTC] sanguinenite: I think phil is better off single so no I dont
[2017-06-25 19:05:46 UTC] xthewrath93x: the house was so empty perhaps overcompensating with photos dealing with single life
[2017-06-25 19:05:46 UTC] blue_blur64: And velvet room music doesn't matter delta, because it's the same song that plays in 2: Innocent Sin, 3, and 4
[2017-06-25 19:05:54 UTC] betheallen: phil better off single, he wont get another gf now though
[2017-06-25 19:06:05 UTC] wouldyoulikesomeballz: Last Surprise is used in a SoK promo on their YouTube. Better forward to that Atlus too Kappa
[2017-06-25 19:06:10 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I thought he said the strike was sorted and it was a misunderstanding Silent?
[2017-06-25 19:06:24 UTC] yaslothy: Minimalist lifestyle Kreygasm
[2017-06-25 19:06:25 UTC] blue_blur64: Well yes jimbob, but it seems to be this way for a lot of people
[2017-06-25 19:06:28 UTC] sanguinenite: why does he need a new gf now tho? Whats so bad about being single?
[2017-06-25 19:06:33 UTC] xthewrath93x: i think dsp needs to have a social life
[2017-06-25 19:06:44 UTC] yaslothy: what's that?
[2017-06-25 19:06:44 UTC] blue_blur64: That almost all of these strikes were not supposed to happen
[2017-06-25 19:06:55 UTC] yaslothy: what is this "social life" you speak of
[2017-06-25 19:06:58 UTC] juubeithehoobae: It is kinda sad wrath but he's pushing through
[2017-06-25 19:07:30 UTC] xthewrath93x: @YaSlothy maybe talking to a girl or something

[2017-06-25 19:14:14 UTC] sanguinenite: I was suspecting that it might be the case, then FT13 would be fine also, P5 is also good
[2017-06-25 19:14:25 UTC] sanguinenite: but the thing is
[2017-06-25 19:14:26 UTC] jackwhite202: so since persona 5 is cancelled will phil play FF12 in july?
[2017-06-25 19:14:29 UTC] sanguinenite: Bethe hates P5
[2017-06-25 19:14:48 UTC] blue_blur64: Probably not still jack, because nobody still knows the full situation with Atlus right now
[2017-06-25 19:15:01 UTC] barack_obama_vs_russia: Pidoras Shall Not PASS !!!
[2017-06-25 19:15:10 UTC] jackwhite202: how many hours does phil have in P5?
[2017-06-25 19:15:21 UTC] blue_blur64: Left, or how much he's played so far?

[2017-06-25 19:15:52 UTC] jackwhite202: holy shit
[2017-06-25 19:16:05 UTC] blue_blur64: And that's only a bit past the halfway point
[2017-06-25 19:16:16 UTC] jackwhite202: all that time wasted because atlus is filled with dumbasses
[2017-06-25 19:16:18 UTC] blue_blur64: Well I guess he's closer to the 2/3 point
[2017-06-25 19:16:47 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, I have to suspect that there'll be some news about this soon
[2017-06-25 19:16:52 UTC] jackwhite202: how can they put that much stuff onto a freaking disc

[2017-06-25 19:19:15 UTC] jackwhite202: how is a game over 100 hours long only 20GB?
[2017-06-25 19:19:22 UTC] leonaras: Play length doesnt quantify game size.
[2017-06-25 19:19:25 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: @xthewrath93x a girl is a girl
[2017-06-25 19:19:28 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: thats it
[2017-06-25 19:19:37 UTC] xthewrath93x: true
[2017-06-25 19:19:41 UTC] yaslothy: Asian grils Kreygasm
[2017-06-25 19:19:48 UTC] wouldyoulikesomeballz: Persona 5 is hardly Uncharted 4 in terms of graphics
[2017-06-25 19:19:49 UTC] rpgasm34: both Kreygasm
[2017-06-25 19:19:58 UTC] jackwhite202: thats some amazing ass optimization
[2017-06-25 19:20:08 UTC] theycallmejimbob: calm down slothy
[2017-06-25 19:20:11 UTC] blue_blur64: The game still looks great regardless ballz :P
[2017-06-25 19:20:26 UTC] yaslothy: ok
[2017-06-25 19:21:04 UTC] jackwhite202: im no programmer but doesnt a game need more GBts if there is more content?
[2017-06-25 19:21:40 UTC] blue_blur64: Again, game length doesn't = content amount
[2017-06-25 19:21:47 UTC] xthewrath93x: well it depends on the graphics
[2017-06-25 19:22:04 UTC] yaslothy: well P5, while a long game, reusues a lot of the same graphics/locales throughout the game
[2017-06-25 19:22:23 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: well, its a JRPG after all
[2017-06-25 19:22:24 UTC] yaslothy: that didn't really make sense but you get my point.
[2017-06-25 19:23:02 UTC] sanguinenite: If JRPGs were not so grindy and repetitive, I would play it
[2017-06-25 19:23:23 UTC] blue_blur64: Well one thing Atlus knows how to do is be able to cut corners but still make it look like an artistic choice. Like how all the people walking around have no faces and have generic models
[2017-06-25 19:23:43 UTC] blue_blur64: Well Persona 5 doesn't need grinding to beat the game :P
[2017-06-25 19:23:59 UTC] leonaras: 300 hours on skyrim, takes 14gb 8D
[2017-06-25 19:24:04 UTC] betheallen: im glad persona is dead
[2017-06-25 19:24:06 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: look at phil. he barely grinded and doing good
[2017-06-25 19:24:06 UTC] yaslothy: it aint no monster hunter OpieOP
[2017-06-25 19:24:12 UTC] betheallen: it is about time
[2017-06-25 19:24:16 UTC] blue_blur64: Meanwhile GTA V takes over 50 GB
[2017-06-25 19:24:28 UTC] yaslothy: of course you are bethe
[2017-06-25 19:24:28 UTC] blue_blur64: There's still a chance bethe :P
[2017-06-25 19:24:43 UTC] betheallen: hope that chance dies
[2017-06-25 19:24:53 UTC] blue_blur64: Just depends on a response by Atlus
[2017-06-25 19:25:00 UTC] yaslothy: its okay, no persona? still have dark souls and danganronpa Kappa
[2017-06-25 19:25:21 UTC] leonaras: Boo godamn grandpa is Zzzz
