[2017-06-15 21:33:18 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @pcgamehunter, Imo, they're doing this to test the waters for interest in a sequel. After all, it's cheaper to remake a game than do dump resources into an all new sequel.

[2017-06-15 21:36:17 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @pcgamehunter, I agree, I want a sequel as well. But better to use as little resources as possible for a remake to gauge sales interest than completely gamble on a sequel which will cost them more and "may" possibly not make them as much as they anticipated.
