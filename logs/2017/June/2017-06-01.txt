[2017-06-01 18:04:49 UTC] yaslothy: I thought you were over it?
[2017-06-01 18:04:52 UTC] yaslothy: the goal?
[2017-06-01 18:04:55 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Far off as too short or higher?
[2017-06-01 18:05:31 UTC] darksydephil: no, as ive said many times, my public facing total is completely wrong. patreon f'ed it up over time and it's not correct at all, plus tons of people get declined
[2017-06-01 18:05:47 UTC] darksydephil: it looks like over $100 was declined
[2017-06-01 18:05:58 UTC] yaslothy: Might be a skin of the teeth situation.
[2017-06-01 18:06:02 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Is that normal for patreon? That seems a lot.

[2017-06-01 18:06:45 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: You should raise the goal then with the expectation of the declined charges.
[2017-06-01 18:06:50 UTC] darksydephil: the whole thing is fucked up, ive got THREE different pledge amounts showing on 3 different pages of the site
[2017-06-01 18:06:55 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: So it still shows that the goal has not been met.
[2017-06-01 18:07:18 UTC] yaslothy: Patreon needs a site overhaul. SeemsGood
[2017-06-01 18:07:29 UTC] darksydephil: it looks like a ton of people pulled their pledges in the last 1-2 days because it dropped by some 20 patrons total
[2017-06-01 18:07:31 UTC] yaslothy: Make things a little more streamlined.
[2017-06-01 18:07:34 UTC] darksydephil: and thats why we didn't hit the goal

[2017-06-01 20:45:31 UTC] wolfmotor69: So, the real question in all of this is simple. Now that Leanna is out somewhere getting plowed in her shitter, does this mean that Phil and Vidar will now have alone time so Phil can plow Vidar's shithole and make him scream Phil's name? Or is Vidar going to look at Phil and say "oh you being tough guy today eh Phillip?" Would they fuck each other with no lube? Phil? BSV? Comment? Glad Leanna finally sees the light, and funny that Phil is trying to downplay the bullshit :D
[2017-06-01 20:45:35 UTC] shekelbergosteinwitz: Phil will probably move back to CT.
