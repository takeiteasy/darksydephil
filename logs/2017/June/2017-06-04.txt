[2017-06-04 01:57:18 UTC] derichloveslemur: Hey @rnrs

[2017-06-04 01:57:40 UTC] xthewrath93x: @RnRs of course he wont lol

[2017-06-04 01:58:09 UTC] rnrs: can't beat $20 for two games
[2017-06-04 01:58:21 UTC] deep_drive: what kind of a switch? Kappa
[2017-06-04 01:58:23 UTC] derichloveslemur: @deep_drive it is sad that Phil's switch got bricked.
[2017-06-04 01:58:26 UTC] deep_drive: nah i don't have a switch tho
[2017-06-04 01:58:39 UTC] deep_drive: several people here have switches i've heard though
[2017-06-04 01:59:21 UTC] deep_drive: no more switch for Phil
[2017-06-04 01:59:24 UTC] derichloveslemur: @deep_drive Street fighter the final challengers would have been another fight game Phil could have played too right?
[2017-06-04 02:00:35 UTC] rnrs: Phil would never admit to it but I feel like he fucked up his switch even if he didn't know he did
[2017-06-04 02:00:47 UTC] rnrs: like he accidentally did something to it and didn't realize
[2017-06-04 02:01:00 UTC] rnrs: turned it off during the update or something
[2017-06-04 02:01:10 UTC] deep_drive: yeah he would have probably gotten that...but now that he doesn't have a switch he probably won't get it just for that game
[2017-06-04 02:01:24 UTC] rnrs: I'm waiting for the price drop for sf2
[2017-06-04 02:01:31 UTC] rnrs: can't bring myself to pay $40
[2017-06-04 02:01:37 UTC] derichloveslemur: Yeah it's sad @deep_drive but you gotta do whatcha gotta do.
[2017-06-04 02:02:00 UTC] deep_drive: Well turning it off during an update shouldn't render it unusable...that's a design failure
[2017-06-04 02:02:35 UTC] derichloveslemur: I can't believe people are still playing L.A. Noire these days on Twitch @deep_drive. do you they'll make a L.A. Noire Sequel?
[2017-06-04 02:03:36 UTC] deep_drive: 2 people are playing it now on twtich it looks like derich
[2017-06-04 02:03:55 UTC] deep_drive: i don't think they'll make a sequel but it would be nice to have one
[2017-06-04 02:04:31 UTC] derichloveslemur: L.A. Noire was one of my favourite playthrough's I ever watched from Phil's channel RedDeadDSP.

[2017-06-04 02:08:13 UTC] 0000anonymous: why doesn't Phil just adjust his schedule 30 mins ahead. I don't recall him ever being on schedule. it would make it easier for everyone else who shows up at the time he mentions

[2017-06-04 03:00:51 UTC] jackythefrost: The problem with Japanese made fighting games is that they are made for Japanese connections, and everyone in japan has a form of Google fiber meaning the entire country is one huge internet hotspot. When they ship these games over seas they always forget that no other country has internet like that for everyone in it.

[2017-06-04 03:38:25 UTC] akioartorius: Bob is using Luffy's rubber concept to propulsion himself
[2017-06-04 03:38:27 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @jackythefrost, It makes sense though. For a very OP dodge, there has to be a drawback to it.

[2017-06-04 04:16:08 UTC] raptrow: @KingJezal FeelsBadMan
[2017-06-04 04:16:26 UTC] wildmandan21: @KingJezal i know he doesnt like to hear this but if he eddited his content he would bring in so much more because people have jobs familys they dont have time to watch the 600 vids he uploads in a month
[2017-06-04 04:16:34 UTC] i_didnt_ask_to_be_badass: So in other words, it's just a jaguar human. No identity
[2017-06-04 04:16:39 UTC] twig121: @KingJezal yeah but if he was doing youtube for a living you'd think he'd put effort into edditing his videos for his fans on dspgaming not ko gaming
[2017-06-04 04:16:50 UTC] nakedcop: I like his raw gameplay
[2017-06-04 04:16:57 UTC] i_didnt_ask_to_be_badass: Why would I want to watch an edited DSP gameplay
[2017-06-04 04:17:07 UTC] 0000anonymous: nice one phil
[2017-06-04 04:17:08 UTC] akioartorius: youtube revenue was flawed regarding its ads so Phil said no
[2017-06-04 04:17:09 UTC] i_didnt_ask_to_be_badass: the whole point is to be part of his full experience
[2017-06-04 04:17:10 UTC] theycallmejosephine: Hello I'm Brightsydeviking :O Did I mention I'm a cuck too! I love to suck phil long dong

[2017-06-04 04:17:24 UTC] johnmatrix31: its effecting everyone
[2017-06-04 04:17:29 UTC] nakedcop: Why should he put effort when he is one of the originals for play throughs?
[2017-06-04 04:17:41 UTC] rainmaker84: got dayum
[2017-06-04 04:17:46 UTC] pissingdemon: please do a set where you make the lobby for fans
[2017-06-04 04:17:49 UTC] kingjezal: But guys, he pumps out tons of content. Editing videos isn't part of his business model, and it is time consuming, especially with how much he streams and the diversity of games he plays.
[2017-06-04 04:17:51 UTC] darthradovanviking: SMH

[2017-06-04 04:18:14 UTC] johnmatrix31: stream is good phil
[2017-06-04 04:18:16 UTC] beanie5181: im half paying attention seems good, practicing moves was more fun than i thought

[2017-06-04 04:18:50 UTC] droppingfnloads: full circle!!
[2017-06-04 04:18:55 UTC] twig121: only reason he pumps out content for youtube is becuase he can't maintain the views, otherwise he wouldn't need so many vids
[2017-06-04 04:18:55 UTC] maaduno: edgy jin
[2017-06-04 04:18:55 UTC] darthradovanviking: cheer102 awesome stream in fact.

[2017-06-04 04:19:26 UTC] pissingdemon: @DarksydePhil i want to fight dspFacepalm
[2017-06-04 04:19:30 UTC] kingjezal: Unless I'm playing a story-heavy game, I always have DSP's videos open as I play. I burn through so many videos this way.
[2017-06-04 04:19:32 UTC] thegiftofaids: flip mode is the greatest
[2017-06-04 04:19:37 UTC] supers18: its jin not gin
[2017-06-04 04:19:43 UTC] mightysandwich: I'd say the single player content is a bit stronger in Injustice if that matters to you
[2017-06-04 04:19:49 UTC] akioartorius: gin? like the drink?
[2017-06-04 04:19:54 UTC] harvyagnt: How do I invite people to lobby?

[2017-06-04 04:20:09 UTC] guccikodak: supers in this game kinda suck
[2017-06-04 04:20:10 UTC] kingjezal: @Wildmandan21 I'd rather he use that added time for the business to make more of the content he is already making, not transforming the form of his content.
[2017-06-04 04:20:21 UTC] 0megaj0ker: :D
[2017-06-04 04:20:23 UTC] nakedcop: Phil loves gin. It's a play on words guys -_-
[2017-06-04 04:20:25 UTC] uran_fat_tee: so... do you watch his videos from start to finish/
[2017-06-04 04:20:30 UTC] jackythefrost: @GucciKodak Before this Tekken didn't have supers
[2017-06-04 04:20:34 UTC] twig121: just becuase you burn through videos this way doesn't mean others can @KingJezal
[2017-06-04 04:20:35 UTC] raptrow: @TaurusOxford hey man

[2017-06-04 04:20:47 UTC] wildmandan21: @KingJezal i dont understand why you are even treating watching his content like a job got burn throught those vids like its a chore..why?
[2017-06-04 04:20:47 UTC] taurusoxford: @raptrow sup
[2017-06-04 04:20:58 UTC] daisoujoe: @DarksydePhil Are you planning to get a new Switch? I wanna see some Arms
[2017-06-04 04:21:08 UTC] i_didnt_ask_to_be_badass: Phil has too many funny parts and good parts to edit, that was his idea from the beginning, so people could stay with him through the whole experience. Editing is more for boring youtubers imo who want to show off the game rather than the unique experience with him
[2017-06-04 04:21:10 UTC] akioartorius: pHil said no new switch
[2017-06-04 04:21:16 UTC] taurusoxford: @Daisoujoe I don't think he cares about Switch or anything Nintendo
[2017-06-04 04:21:16 UTC] nakedcop: I remember watch his sf madness vids. I miss those
[2017-06-04 04:21:17 UTC] howlingwolfjoey: The supers are kinda crappy imo. its not flashy like most other fighting games. -_-
[2017-06-04 04:21:26 UTC] thegiftofaids: i would love to see phil play some MOBAs
[2017-06-04 04:21:32 UTC] dkmariolink: @howlingwolfjoey not supposed to be flashy
[2017-06-04 04:21:38 UTC] kingjezal: @Twig121 Yeah, and that's a shame, I'll admit. It's not impossible to keep up with his stuff though.

[2017-06-04 04:27:43 UTC] wildmandan21: @KingJezal ok i understand you like it the way it is but if he just added some eddited content it would be very good for him because the goal is to atract more viewers
[2017-06-04 04:27:47 UTC] jackythefrost: Very easy to pick up and play as her
[2017-06-04 04:27:52 UTC] marcusdoesgaming: So RedDeadDSP got renamed?
[2017-06-04 04:27:56 UTC] i_didnt_ask_to_be_badass: It seems my favorite Let's Plays are a mix of (a) my favorite games and (b) how much Phil was engaged with the game. For instance, Zelda and Banjo-Tooie are my favorite games of all time but Phil doesn't seem as engaged in those as like Heavy Rain, Silent Hill 2 or Until Dawn. I really like those games however so the combanation of the 2 those make my favorite LP experience

Furthermore, the city of Boulder frequently receives high rankings in art, health, well-being, quality of life, and education.[12]

[2017-06-04 18:30:34 UTC] chrisbreezy00: so phil only lost 2 matches yesterday?
[2017-06-04 18:30:40 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Against the anime bs characters

[2017-06-04 18:31:20 UTC] podusmonens: it's obvious why he removed the soap command, not sure about the rest
[2017-06-04 18:31:27 UTC] chrisbreezy00: I mean i remember there was one match in super slow motion 1 bar

[2017-06-04 18:32:54 UTC] podusmonens: oh well
[2017-06-04 18:33:05 UTC] sanguinenite: In some way, I think Phil shouldnt always bring up online lag and complain about it since it is a common problem with most multiplayer games, no reason to repeat the same old complaints. Not to say that online lag doesnt exist....
[2017-06-04 18:33:07 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Deep_Drive you are awesome bud! how's your sunday?
[2017-06-04 18:33:12 UTC] deep_drive: lol bethe

[2017-06-04 18:33:35 UTC] podusmonens: what's the proof?
[2017-06-04 18:33:36 UTC] akioartorius: @sanguinenite there were exceptions like that 1 bar match though
[2017-06-04 18:33:46 UTC] yaslothy: She doesn't belittle me.
[2017-06-04 18:33:46 UTC] deep_drive: i can do this i think
[2017-06-04 18:33:47 UTC] xthewrath93x: bulking at the mo

[2017-06-04 19:20:25 UTC] derichloveslemur: its probably a troll.

[2017-06-04 19:20:50 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: well Phil you've shared a whole lot over the years, people are going to have to get used to you not sharing as much anymore.
[2017-06-04 19:20:53 UTC] chrisbreezy00: yea your trolls are no lifers but i think the chris chan stalkers were worse
[2017-06-04 19:20:54 UTC] yaslothy: I don't do that, BeThe.
[2017-06-04 19:20:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn it's on YaSlothy at 1am on bt sports 1 should I watch hmmm

[2017-06-04 19:21:23 UTC] akioartorius: @blue_blur64 I regret typing that
[2017-06-04 19:21:26 UTC] betheallen: cherdy everyone denies farting but they all do it be a man and admit it

[2017-06-04 19:21:35 UTC] darthradovanviking: fantastic that people complain about someone sharing to much personal information but when they can not get it. They just go mad in the search for it
[2017-06-04 19:21:36 UTC] jwalker70: people are way too nozy

[2017-06-04 19:21:43 UTC] darksydephil: i mean just to give some perspective, i said i wouldn't talk about what car i got. these people did everything in their power to try and figure it out regardless of the fact it has nothing to do with anything relating to them. why? just because they felt they could. that's mental illness
[2017-06-04 19:21:43 UTC] yaslothy: bethe I don't do it in public.
[2017-06-04 19:21:57 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarthRadovanViking Hey bud!

[2017-06-04 19:22:34 UTC] sanguinenite: Exactly, I had to point out to the trolls that they need medical attention because the level of obsession with you a guy playing video games is madness.
[2017-06-04 19:22:39 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: i thought i got banned lol
[2017-06-04 19:22:51 UTC] akioartorius: How do they get the information anyway?
[2017-06-04 19:22:52 UTC] yaslothy: Oh boy.

[2017-06-04 19:23:18 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Honestly if there were detractors in washington state i would probably be scared for my life if i were phil like how far can these guys go
[2017-06-04 19:23:19 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: isnt ignoring the trolls an option darksydephil ? just saying
[2017-06-04 19:23:20 UTC] darksydephil: they apparently called the real estate company that was trying to short sell my condo on their podcast just because they could....the fuck?

[2017-06-04 19:23:31 UTC] ughhhj: Are you alright or are you starting to get worried?

[2017-06-04 19:23:45 UTC] podusmonens: :D
[2017-06-04 19:23:46 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: but Phil you keep saying you need people to care about you, to pay for your bills and keep this going. These same people giving you money, some are naturally going to genuinely care about what your plans are
[2017-06-04 19:23:47 UTC] betheallen: i think i didnt say hello to pops
[2017-06-04 19:23:47 UTC] yaslothy: lel

[2017-06-04 19:34:54 UTC] blue_blur64: We can IP ban deep?
[2017-06-04 19:34:54 UTC] aquamah: BibleThump BibleThump Kappa

[2017-06-04 19:37:59 UTC] chrisbreezy00: a system ban can not be escaped if you get system banned you will never get on twitch again
[2017-06-04 19:38:02 UTC] chrisbreezy00: on the same computer atleast
[2017-06-04 19:38:02 UTC] blk_mage_ctype: If you ever want to verify that someone is a stealth troll, just wait for them to randomly post some mannerisms of Phil's in the chat, bonus points if they're ordinary bodily functions like belching.
[2017-06-04 19:38:06 UTC] renastella: being called a child lol
[2017-06-04 19:38:10 UTC] hardwookie: @Deep_Drive why would they care?

[2017-06-04 19:38:20 UTC] vpzneox: Unless you change IP ^_^
[2017-06-04 19:38:21 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Dude it is really easy to change your IP these days. I mean you can just get a VPN.
[2017-06-04 19:38:22 UTC] deep_drive: too much work for them
[2017-06-04 19:38:24 UTC] theycallmejimbob: woah calm down pureo_nikku not you too :D
[2017-06-04 19:38:25 UTC] derichloveslemur: @darthradovanviking @deep_drive so Ban evasion is someone making another account after they have been banned?

[2017-06-04 19:38:42 UTC] chrisbreezy00: That means they lock your computer out of Twitch
[2017-06-04 19:38:43 UTC] deep_drive: its like making another account to talk in a channel after you've already been banned there
[2017-06-04 19:38:44 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Wtf is a system ban?
[2017-06-04 19:38:48 UTC] hardwookie: @chrisbreezy00 whats that?
