[2017-06-16 18:11:28 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: digital download you pay more money its not worth it
[2017-06-16 18:12:02 UTC] nuclear_armed_hogs: Unless your playing on PC or get great discounts, digital on console of pretty lame

[2017-06-16 18:14:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hello hello
[2017-06-16 18:14:25 UTC] sanguinenite: I honestly hate most games that are not available on disc. And yes, most of the games which I did not pirate are all available on a physical disc. The only game that I paid for that is digital is Assassin's Creed
[2017-06-16 18:14:44 UTC] nuclear_armed_hogs: Phil is such a dad
[2017-06-16 18:14:52 UTC] nuclear_armed_hogs: without actually being a dad

[2017-06-16 18:15:02 UTC] misterdragin: :)
[2017-06-16 18:15:06 UTC] sanguinenite: Phil is probably bored of the clubbing scene seeing how he's been there and done that
[2017-06-16 18:15:22 UTC] betheallen: im with dragin on this

[2017-06-16 18:16:57 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeah podusmonens, I look the golden age of gaming which is anywhere in 1990s and early 2000s, most new games just are not interesting to me. I watch Phil because of his personality.
[2017-06-16 18:17:02 UTC] misterdragin: hey bby take yer tahp aff but be careful I have a bad back
[2017-06-16 18:17:07 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: LOL

[2017-06-16 18:29:02 UTC] sanguinenite: I find that disgusting
[2017-06-16 18:29:31 UTC] sanguinenite: I wonder if IO became independent because Hitman was a success or not, since they never disclosed sales numbers
[2017-06-16 18:29:50 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: Hitman was awful, episodic style is bad
[2017-06-16 18:30:08 UTC] sanguinenite: With the always online DRM, yeah it was bad

[2017-06-16 18:56:38 UTC] sanguinenite: He banned me once by accident
[2017-06-16 18:56:48 UTC] capstonecommune: or like what i did talk some nasty shit then dip out so they cant ban u cuz yu arent there but then you come back and theyre waiting for you
[2017-06-16 18:56:50 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: accidents happen
[2017-06-16 18:57:33 UTC] sanguinenite: Not going to lie, I got pretty mad at Vidar but I let it go after awhile since he did admit that it was his fault
[2017-06-16 18:57:34 UTC] octoberd: @akioartorius i just honestly haven't watched phil live much since he made the switch to twitch, i guess because 1. i don't have as much time these days 2. i'm not familiar with twitch
[2017-06-16 18:57:41 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: Too many undercover trolls on these streams thats why he bans a lot.
[2017-06-16 18:57:55 UTC] octoberd: last time i remember watching phil was breath of the wild a few times and yakuza 0
[2017-06-16 18:58:01 UTC] akioartorius: @octoberd its good
[2017-06-16 18:58:01 UTC] sanguinenite: yeah which is one reason why I dont take it personally when people think Im a troll
[2017-06-16 18:58:01 UTC] octoberd: live that is
[2017-06-16 18:58:19 UTC] capstonecommune: tbh i went back to youtube for content uploads cuz...well...i can focus more on the game and if internet cuts out so what not gonna stop me from recording a part
[2017-06-16 18:58:33 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: But honestly Phil is a funny dude its funny making a joke here and there
[2017-06-16 18:58:46 UTC] capstonecommune: ill play fighting games on twitch but playthroughs will be higher quality on youtube
[2017-06-16 18:58:57 UTC] sanguinenite: Phil is the funniest gaming dude I have seen on youtube and or twitch
[2017-06-16 18:58:59 UTC] capstonecommune: Ginosaji has the best jokes
[2017-06-16 18:59:09 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: When Phil snorts it turns me on
[2017-06-16 18:59:12 UTC] sanguinenite: I miss Gino's brazzers commands
[2017-06-16 18:59:13 UTC] capstonecommune: LOL
[2017-06-16 18:59:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: WutFace
[2017-06-16 18:59:21 UTC] misterdragin: diccrider
[2017-06-16 18:59:28 UTC] capstonecommune: phil is funny for completely separate reasons tho
[2017-06-16 18:59:37 UTC] sanguinenite: like what are you referring to?
[2017-06-16 18:59:43 UTC] capstonecommune: like a guy slipping on the same banan peel for 10 years thats the joke im laughing at
[2017-06-16 18:59:47 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: im sorry guys but its attractive his been snorting since 2008 since he started its classic and his sigature
[2017-06-16 18:59:57 UTC] popsicolo: !THEBOT
[2017-06-16 18:59:57 UTC] nightbot: BOT-ZZERS MrDestructoid
[2017-06-16 19:00:08 UTC] sanguinenite: Yeaahh Pops!
[2017-06-16 19:00:10 UTC] capstonecommune: he needs rambo back
[2017-06-16 19:00:16 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: Phil is unintentionally funny, to be honest. And I think he's more aware of this these days, fact that he acknowledges people like it when he gets salty in fighting games and stuff
[2017-06-16 19:00:26 UTC] misterdragin: they're not friends anymore..
[2017-06-16 19:00:41 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: Yeah lol he is a funny dude and his life is funny too
[2017-06-16 19:01:03 UTC] misterdragin: don't act like you didn't see the HOUR LONG "fuck phil" vid rambo and howard made
[2017-06-16 19:01:03 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: on hate live he said he wont be doing co-op ever with john
[2017-06-16 19:01:11 UTC] thedoctor5437: I like watching phil because for whatever reason hes a game bug magnet
[2017-06-16 19:01:22 UTC] misterdragin: gee I wonder if he brings rambo back
[2017-06-16 19:01:33 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: nah i think Phil is cursed he gets all the game bugs, broken consoles
[2017-06-16 19:01:39 UTC] sanguinenite: lol all the game developers are secret trolls of phil and enjoy seeing phil suffer Kappa
[2017-06-16 19:01:51 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: honestly I don't think Phil watched the vid properly. John Rambo and Howard made it clear they do not 'hate' Phil, they wish him all the best. Either Phil was fed misinformation or he only watched parts of it
[2017-06-16 19:02:04 UTC] sanguinenite: no I think he is blessed because if he didnt get that, he wouldnt be as funny
[2017-06-16 19:02:06 UTC] akioartorius: its the secret game developer conspiracy Kappa
[2017-06-16 19:02:12 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: It happened long time ago dude i dont think anyone cares at this point
[2017-06-16 19:02:26 UTC] sanguinenite: PermaSmug
[2017-06-16 19:02:27 UTC] akioartorius: @hotsauceistoohot both
[2017-06-16 19:02:33 UTC] misterdragin: umm howard talked abouthow he and the editing crew he brought weren't paid a single dime
[2017-06-16 19:02:45 UTC] misterdragin: I think it was pretty much bridge burning
[2017-06-16 19:02:49 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: Phil said they didnt ask for any money though
[2017-06-16 19:02:53 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: true - I actually rewatched the video the other day, I'm up to speed. They got googats
[2017-06-16 19:02:57 UTC] sanguinenite: I remember I watched the whole video of rambo and howard, the truth is it is their fault for not making the T&Cs clear
[2017-06-16 19:03:26 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: i think they should have spoke to Phil personally instead of making a video behind his back
[2017-06-16 19:03:39 UTC] misterdragin: whatever it is, it's clear they weren't trying to patch things up, but to do the opposite of that. it's all I'm saying
[2017-06-16 19:03:39 UTC] capstonecommune: nah...they needed to lear the air
[2017-06-16 19:03:43 UTC] sanguinenite: I think they should have made it clear that if they didnt get sufficient publicity that they expected that monetary compensation would be made, I think Phil would have agreed as such if they had been smarter
[2017-06-16 19:04:07 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: Phil did plug their channels though
[2017-06-16 19:04:17 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: and at that time he was very big on youtube
[2017-06-16 19:04:27 UTC] akioartorius: For some reason, I feel like Phil is going to pop out of nowhere in the chat and tell us to stop with the drama Kappa
[2017-06-16 19:04:27 UTC] capstonecommune: monetizing videos is tricky starts as just a no brianer for content to recieve payment but then as the vlogs turn to personal matters it could be constrewed that ur profiting off of the personal matter
[2017-06-16 19:04:29 UTC] sanguinenite: I think the reason why Rambo and Howard have no desire to patch things up is because they have given up being a youtube sensation like phil is.
[2017-06-16 19:04:50 UTC] capstonecommune: lol
[2017-06-16 19:05:02 UTC] capstonecommune: theyre jealous phils POWA
[2017-06-16 19:05:04 UTC] sanguinenite: so they decided to go to the ways of the Sok, riding the coat tails of success
[2017-06-16 19:05:08 UTC] sanguinenite: by being trolls
[2017-06-16 19:05:09 UTC] capstonecommune: he has brought peace to his new EMPIRE
[2017-06-16 19:05:10 UTC] sanguinenite: sad life
[2017-06-16 19:05:12 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: If there ever was a youtube hall of fame Phil should be the first to be inducted into it
[2017-06-16 19:05:34 UTC] taurusoxford: @akioartorius Pretty sure what usually happens is he shows up and 10 accounts get banned instantly
[2017-06-16 19:05:41 UTC] iconicmaster1: Where Phil at SwiftRage
[2017-06-16 19:05:45 UTC] octoberd: pretty sure smosh would be inducted before phil no offense
[2017-06-16 19:05:47 UTC] akioartorius: Gamestop?
[2017-06-16 19:05:47 UTC] snipertheladiesman: So when is the stream?
[2017-06-16 19:05:57 UTC] capstonecommune: smosh boogie pewds
[2017-06-16 19:06:00 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: Smosh is lame, Phil is the youtube Icon
[2017-06-16 19:06:00 UTC] capstonecommune: avgn
[2017-06-16 19:06:08 UTC] capstonecommune: only for fappin his dick
[2017-06-16 19:06:11 UTC] sanguinenite: Smosh was good way way back then it became shit
[2017-06-16 19:06:32 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: Friend request ridicule was golden when phil did it
[2017-06-16 19:06:47 UTC] capstonecommune: im here to see how he recovers from that and so far hes hanign gin there
[2017-06-16 19:07:00 UTC] sanguinenite: I honestly would love to see more friend request ridicule it was funny and we all know he was joking so its fine
[2017-06-16 19:07:15 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: if Phil had the BMW he'd have returned by now :P damn toyotas
[2017-06-16 19:07:36 UTC] taurusoxford: He should have gotten a Chrysler
[2017-06-16 19:07:38 UTC] capstonecommune: I wanna see phil talk to fred fuchs in a SUPER secure place and with a top tier debate moderator
[2017-06-16 19:07:43 UTC] capstonecommune: put it all in the past
[2017-06-16 19:07:47 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: Ew no dude
[2017-06-16 19:07:49 UTC] sanguinenite: no thanks
[2017-06-16 19:08:00 UTC] taurusoxford: who would the moderator be? Slowbeef?
[2017-06-16 19:08:08 UTC] capstonecommune: LOL I justine
[2017-06-16 19:08:10 UTC] capstonecommune: obviously
[2017-06-16 19:08:15 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: Phil will never talk to Fred because, let's be brutally honest here, facts are not really on Phil's side with quite a few things. Not gonna happen
[2017-06-16 19:08:16 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: that loser needs a life
[2017-06-16 19:08:16 UTC] akioartorius: @SanguineNite Phil already talked about it. He said that He rather do like a fan mail type thing then ridicule vids because he is a more mature person now. His words
[2017-06-16 19:08:21 UTC] betheallen: seeing people stand up swinging there arms like madmen in arms is pretty funny
[2017-06-16 19:08:24 UTC] sanguinenite: fred fuch is an unemployed pol science major and phil wouldnt gain anything positive from it
[2017-06-16 19:08:31 UTC] sanguinenite: @akioartorius I know but still
[2017-06-16 19:08:32 UTC] betheallen: even if you dont need to do that
[2017-06-16 19:08:36 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: @hotsauceistoohot Phil can just call him a stalker and show proof, he won the debate

[2017-06-16 19:09:45 UTC] agoodrpg: Arms today
[2017-06-16 19:09:54 UTC] akioartorius: Does Phil still know that lawyer who is also a gamer?
[2017-06-16 19:10:05 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: Phoenix Wright?
[2017-06-16 19:10:10 UTC] taurusoxford: lol
[2017-06-16 19:10:14 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: yeah its g=his lawyer
[2017-06-16 19:10:37 UTC] taurusoxford: Does Wright even play videogames? Never played his games
[2017-06-16 19:11:08 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Phil should play Twintelle for certain... reasons Kappa
[2017-06-16 19:11:31 UTC] capstonecommune: he should play whatever ppl want him to play minus the blacklist of games he will under no circumstances play
[2017-06-16 19:11:38 UTC] akioartorius: People said Phil should play Hunie Pop but isn't it banned on Twitch?
[2017-06-16 19:11:41 UTC] capstonecommune: scarface etc
[2017-06-16 19:11:50 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: Phil should play Scarface 2 the remake
[2017-06-16 19:11:59 UTC] octoberd: scarface is pretty good idk why he hates it so much
[2017-06-16 19:12:00 UTC] popsicolo: Did someone say Huniepop? PogChamp

[2017-06-16 19:12:28 UTC] jasonvoorhees34: Phils lawyer is jar jar binks
[2017-06-16 19:12:30 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: honestly Phil should just play what he wants to play. He's pressuring himself too much, what did he call it 'broketober', but he should only just prioritise on his desires for that period. That way at least he'd be enjoying himself while streaming, rather than worrying
[2017-06-16 19:12:30 UTC] akioartorius: Huniepop is banned on Twitch isn't it?
[2017-06-16 19:12:46 UTC] capstonecommune: KonCha Derich
[2017-06-16 19:12:48 UTC] chrisbreezy00: lol twitch cant ban games

[2017-06-16 19:12:59 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @akioartorius Twitch has a ban list somewhere
[2017-06-16 19:13:12 UTC] capstonecommune: nah he isnt original enough with his game selection
[2017-06-16 19:13:13 UTC] betheallen: phil should be here soon
[2017-06-16 19:13:24 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: there is absolutely a list of games banned on twitch btw
[2017-06-16 19:13:30 UTC] akioartorius: and I am positive someone told me it was banned
[2017-06-16 19:13:33 UTC] chrisbreezy00: phil finally got the pro controller so now he can really start rekting in SF2
[2017-06-16 19:13:40 UTC] capstonecommune: he needs to ractice the charisma and the laid back hands off approach of live streeaming a random game ppl will be curious to see
[2017-06-16 19:13:53 UTC] capstonecommune: and hit the gin
[2017-06-16 19:13:57 UTC] akioartorius: @chrisbreezy00 and continue his 146-36 record

[2017-06-16 19:14:23 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: Phil said he had pecs. He must've put something in the v8 lol
[2017-06-16 19:14:24 UTC] capstonecommune: n
[2017-06-16 19:14:35 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Phil has those dragon ball pecs

[2017-06-16 19:15:09 UTC] akioartorius: Does the beign shirt count?
[2017-06-16 19:15:18 UTC] capstonecommune: i know that. and i probably caused it.
[2017-06-16 19:15:32 UTC] capstonecommune: but oh well they werent a good couple anyway really
[2017-06-16 19:15:34 UTC] chrisbreezy00: phil should do irl workout streams

[2017-06-16 23:28:38 UTC] yaslothy: I took a nap because my stomach wasn't feeling well...
[2017-06-16 23:28:44 UTC] yaslothy: now I know why. I had a premonition.
[2017-06-16 23:28:46 UTC] misterdragin: she was like hell naw to the naw naw, nawww

[2017-06-16 23:30:09 UTC] yaslothy: it seems fine
[2017-06-16 23:30:41 UTC] yaslothy: I guess Zahvone's campaign for me as mod didn't work. MingLee
[2017-06-16 23:30:49 UTC] yaslothy: (its okay, I don't want to be mod)
[2017-06-16 23:31:06 UTC] misterdragin: too much of a hassle. plus you're on the radar of soks

[2017-06-16 23:32:27 UTC] misterdragin: did you ever go to the IMDB message board, sloth? just to read stuff. it was fun for me
[2017-06-16 23:32:34 UTC] yaslothy: yes
[2017-06-16 23:32:43 UTC] yaslothy: heard they got rid of it a couple months ago
[2017-06-16 23:32:48 UTC] misterdragin: they got rid of it and it's total BS
[2017-06-16 23:32:49 UTC] yaslothy: tbh IMDB message board was toxic
[2017-06-16 23:32:54 UTC] yaslothy: but it was fun
[2017-06-16 23:32:56 UTC] misterdragin: yeah.. YUGe mistake
[2017-06-16 23:33:03 UTC] misterdragin: dude it was helpful sometimes
[2017-06-16 23:33:06 UTC] misterdragin: a lot of times
[2017-06-16 23:33:17 UTC] yaslothy: troo troo
[2017-06-16 23:33:20 UTC] yaslothy: why did it get shut down?
[2017-06-16 23:33:31 UTC] misterdragin: when I had questions at the end of a movie.. there was guaranteed to be a post there raising the same issue
[2017-06-16 23:33:56 UTC] misterdragin: well basically what you said, that it became kinda toxic. but it's a message board, what do you expect
[2017-06-16 23:34:09 UTC] yaslothy: damn
[2017-06-16 23:34:24 UTC] misterdragin: of course there will be the usual " I met brad pitt IL and he was a dick!" post once in a while
[2017-06-16 23:34:32 UTC] misterdragin: IRL*

[2017-06-16 23:35:54 UTC] yaslothy: yeah that's probably not as fun

[2017-06-16 23:37:51 UTC] yaslothy: bethe as a mod bethe as a mod bethe as a mod

[2017-06-16 23:41:33 UTC] misterdragin: well there are two 5 * reviews
[2017-06-16 23:41:39 UTC] misterdragin: comments are pretty funny usually
[2017-06-16 23:41:47 UTC] yaslothy: user ratings 4.0
[2017-06-16 23:41:50 UTC] yaslothy: seems solid
[2017-06-16 23:42:07 UTC] yaslothy: I wasn't totally head over heels about the singles, they were good but not blow away.
[2017-06-16 23:42:23 UTC] misterdragin: "each time i listen to this record i'm tempted to just let it sweep me off my feet. i'm just very suspicious of the epic, sparse, repetitive song structures on this thing. i feel like there isn't much there behind the reverb and strumming."
[2017-06-16 23:42:34 UTC] misterdragin: this is how I feel about FF in general
[2017-06-16 23:42:41 UTC] misterdragin: there's only so much rever I can take
[2017-06-16 23:42:44 UTC] misterdragin: reverb
[2017-06-16 23:43:32 UTC] yaslothy: well
[2017-06-16 23:43:35 UTC] yaslothy: shit
[2017-06-16 23:43:41 UTC] misterdragin: anyway, sowingseason is a great reviewer
[2017-06-16 23:43:42 UTC] misterdragin: wha
[2017-06-16 23:43:52 UTC] yaslothy: nuffin
[2017-06-16 23:44:31 UTC] misterdragin: fleet faxes that hipster nahnsense
[2017-06-16 23:44:48 UTC] yaslothy: i know rite
[2017-06-16 23:45:03 UTC] noobfirstclass: DSP ever beat the final boss?
[2017-06-16 23:45:51 UTC] philandchill: imgur : MxtU0cq reminds me of Zelda. It just needs the Happy Mask Salesman and Tingle to be complete
[2017-06-16 23:45:58 UTC] yaslothy: no
[2017-06-16 23:46:26 UTC] noobfirstclass: rip
[2017-06-16 23:46:31 UTC] yaslothy: MingLee
[2017-06-16 23:47:17 UTC] misterdragin: it seemed to me that he wanted to grab all the time
[2017-06-16 23:47:21 UTC] misterdragin: and nothing else
[2017-06-16 23:47:29 UTC] noobfirstclass: Yeah he was too much of grabs an jump
[2017-06-16 23:47:40 UTC] noobfirstclass: He hardly ever blocked either.
[2017-06-16 23:47:41 UTC] yaslothy: too much jumping
[2017-06-16 23:47:46 UTC] misterdragin: like in NBA jam all he did was shoot for 3s
[2017-06-16 23:47:58 UTC] misterdragin: when the fun of the game were crazy dunks
[2017-06-16 23:48:03 UTC] misterdragin: :D
[2017-06-16 23:48:06 UTC] noobfirstclass: The AI knows how to punish jumps like nothing else.
[2017-06-16 23:48:39 UTC] yaslothy: dragin do you like black swan, requiem for a dream etc?
[2017-06-16 23:48:40 UTC] noobfirstclass: Kind of goes to show how much nintendo knew about their own game to know that jumping is not preferable.
[2017-06-16 23:48:50 UTC] misterdragin: I don't really like the game but I'm down for some online salt
[2017-06-16 23:48:59 UTC] hisui4: hi is phil streaming?
[2017-06-16 23:49:06 UTC] noobfirstclass: Yeah definitely
[2017-06-16 23:49:11 UTC] misterdragin: yes, aronofsky in general sloth
[2017-06-16 23:49:12 UTC] noobfirstclass: No phil isn't streaming currently
[2017-06-16 23:49:22 UTC] yaslothy: okay
[2017-06-16 23:49:23 UTC] noobfirstclass: He ragequit on final boss.
[2017-06-16 23:49:29 UTC] hisui4: is he gonna stream later? :o
[2017-06-16 23:49:40 UTC] noobfirstclass: I don't know but it probably won't be this game.
[2017-06-16 23:49:54 UTC] noobfirstclass: He's had too much PJSalt for today
[2017-06-16 23:49:57 UTC] misterdragin: it was rumored a while ago that he will direct the robocop remake.. I was pumped. but hegave up on it, and, well..the movie sucked ass
[2017-06-16 23:50:08 UTC] philandchill: if this game came out on PS4 or sth, how many views would it get. maybe 4 or 40. I want to see more Adventure games
[2017-06-16 23:50:08 UTC] hisui4: he should take a break and then go back to it using the pro controller and see how he fares.
[2017-06-16 23:50:15 UTC] yaslothy: I like him too but imma send you a link
[2017-06-16 23:50:21 UTC] misterdragin: send
[2017-06-16 23:50:31 UTC] yaslothy: i feel like this upcoming rant is you about Kenny L
[2017-06-16 23:50:40 UTC] yaslothy: k sending
[2017-06-16 23:50:45 UTC] misterdragin: I think PI was the first movie by him that I saw
[2017-06-16 23:51:02 UTC] noobfirstclass: @hisui4 he should probably consult the tutorial so he would know why shit was happening. Like his arms getting cancelled out due to weight and whatever.
[2017-06-16 23:53:24 UTC] misterdragin: well I see the guy's point.. I'm not crazy about him either, he's just bette rthan the usual hollywood stuff
[2017-06-16 23:53:49 UTC] yaslothy: MingLee its you about kenny MingLee
[2017-06-16 23:53:51 UTC] misterdragin: it's the same people say about innaritu.. ya know, birdman, the revenant?
[2017-06-16 23:53:58 UTC] yaslothy: nah im a big fan but its just funny
[2017-06-16 23:54:02 UTC] hisui4: @noobfirstclass i think they said earlier in stream that he did the tutorial already. the tutorial o ly taught him the most basic controls. it didnt teach him how to do other important fundamentals of the game. so i cant really blame him on that part.
[2017-06-16 23:54:18 UTC] yaslothy: birdman Kreygasm
[2017-06-16 23:54:22 UTC] yaslothy: never seen the revenant
[2017-06-16 23:54:36 UTC] misterdragin: I'm starting to dig kirean movies. In the mood for love is a masterpiece :)
[2017-06-16 23:54:37 UTC] philandchill: Yes, but where are the Adventure games instead of these overhyped Nintendo games'
[2017-06-16 23:54:50 UTC] yaslothy: kieran movies?
[2017-06-16 23:54:55 UTC] philandchill: Monkey Island 6!

[2017-06-16 23:55:22 UTC] misterdragin: eh.
[2017-06-16 23:55:28 UTC] misterdragin: yea but not actiony
[2017-06-16 23:55:29 UTC] yaslothy: the original
[2017-06-16 23:55:45 UTC] hisui4: i love korean dramas and music, but i dont like any of their two hour movies. only one i liked was "my wife is a gangster"
[2017-06-16 23:55:45 UTC] misterdragin: in the mood for love is visual poetry
[2017-06-16 23:56:39 UTC] hisui4: japanese dramas are okay, but its difficult to encounter one thats likable. its like watching an anime, just not as good most of the time.
[2017-06-16 23:56:40 UTC] philandchill: I have to say, my favorite movies are The Time Machine (2002), Miyazaki films like Ponyo or Howl, Mulholland Dr., and Harry Potter is pretty beautiful
[2017-06-16 23:56:58 UTC] hisui4: my favorite movie of all time is Treasure Planet.
[2017-06-16 23:57:16 UTC] hisui4: it reminds me f the jrpg': Rogue Galaxy
[2017-06-16 23:57:21 UTC] hisui4: of
[2017-06-16 23:57:26 UTC] philandchill: Muholland Dr is the most cerebrally emotional movie ever. Everything in there is a hidden message or concept about the story
[2017-06-16 23:57:52 UTC] yaslothy: not another teen movie was really dark and moody too
[2017-06-16 23:57:54 UTC] philandchill: Though, I can't beat The Time Machine (2002) as far as pure emotion
[2017-06-16 23:58:26 UTC] hisui4: i dont look for emotion in media. XD its not my taste.
[2017-06-16 23:58:40 UTC] hisui4: i like action, mystery, thrillers, and revenge plots
[2017-06-16 23:58:54 UTC] philandchill: I don't look for expression, but emotion, that's in everthing
[2017-06-16 23:59:04 UTC] hisui4: thats deep lol
[2017-06-16 23:59:05 UTC] yaslothy: anything that is good i'll ingest
[2017-06-16 23:59:29 UTC] philandchill: mystery and revenge is great
[2017-06-16 23:59:46 UTC] yaslothy: hitchcock SeemsGood
