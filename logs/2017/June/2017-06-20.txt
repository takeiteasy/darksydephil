[2017-06-20 17:56:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey jack
[2017-06-20 17:56:40 UTC] jackwhite202: Is this game better than friday the 13th?
[2017-06-20 17:56:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it's not on the psn store yet?
[2017-06-20 17:56:44 UTC] jackwhite202: that game sucks
[2017-06-20 17:57:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: well the game is on steam for over a year so hopefully the devs will have a smoother release compared to Gun Media on console
[2017-06-20 17:57:44 UTC] theycallmejimbob: speaking of steam 47 hours to go till the steam sale SwiftRage
[2017-06-20 17:58:07 UTC] jackwhite202: not that hyped for steam sale
[2017-06-20 17:58:19 UTC] jackwhite202: only game i play from steam is team fortress 2
[2017-06-20 17:58:29 UTC] friendlyfaucetbandit: cold weather is the best!
[2017-06-20 17:58:36 UTC] akioartorius: so what was the score yesterday?
[2017-06-20 17:58:39 UTC] theycallmejimbob: although usually you're not able to access the steam store for an hour on release day due to traffic
[2017-06-20 17:58:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: we lost count akio :( you were missed as Phil was asking towards the end what was the score
[2017-06-20 17:59:30 UTC] jackwhite202: anyone excited for COD WW2?
[2017-06-20 18:00:06 UTC] akioartorius: so the pre stream is in 30 mins huh
[2017-06-20 18:00:23 UTC] akioartorius: and yes I am excited to see what COD WW2 is about
[2017-06-20 18:00:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he said on twitter he was starting the stream in a few mins
[2017-06-20 18:00:25 UTC] friendlyfaucetbandit: tuna is waaay better then COD
[2017-06-20 18:01:06 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no humble bundle this week cause of the steam sale :(
[2017-06-20 18:01:37 UTC] jackwhite202: anything unique about this game that makes it different from friday the 13th
[2017-06-20 18:01:39 UTC] jackwhite202: ?
[2017-06-20 18:01:53 UTC] mozoyvr: Cause there aint no cure for the summertime blues
[2017-06-20 18:02:32 UTC] akioartorius: For some reason I thought of Cowboy Bebop @MozoYVR
[2017-06-20 18:02:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: not really jack from what I seen
[2017-06-20 18:02:49 UTC] banjogeek: First DSP stream! Is Phil as awesome as I've heard he is at games or are the detractors right
[2017-06-20 18:03:10 UTC] jackwhite202: hopefully this game actually works
[2017-06-20 18:03:13 UTC] akioartorius: @Banjogeek welcome to the chat
[2017-06-20 18:03:16 UTC] jackwhite202: unlike F13
[2017-06-20 18:03:32 UTC] banjogeek: Thank u
[2017-06-20 18:03:37 UTC] mozoyvr: It's cringe comedy. When he's not complaining about the usual
[2017-06-20 18:03:44 UTC] theycallmejimbob: depends on the game Kappa
[2017-06-20 18:04:06 UTC] jackwhite202: oh well
[2017-06-20 18:04:19 UTC] jackwhite202: anyone getting FF12 ZA in july
[2017-06-20 18:04:22 UTC] jackwhite202: ?
[2017-06-20 18:04:31 UTC] mozoyvr: "bugs", "lag", "the game developers fucked up", the usual
[2017-06-20 18:04:47 UTC] mozoyvr: I can't understand Final Fantasy at all
[2017-06-20 18:05:43 UTC] banjogeek: So how has he been lately? All I've heard was that he use to be engaged and partnered with Machinima, but I don't know if thats been effecting the content in any way
[2017-06-20 18:05:56 UTC] sanguinenite: @MozoYVR Cringe comedy? What's so cringe about his humour? Sometimes, it is just funny, no cringe.
[2017-06-20 18:06:26 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Banjo hes overall the best gamer in the country
[2017-06-20 18:06:29 UTC] chrisbreezy00: thats all you need to know
[2017-06-20 18:06:44 UTC] jackwhite202: is Final Fantasy 12 a good game?
[2017-06-20 18:06:48 UTC] jackwhite202: anyone know?
[2017-06-20 18:06:48 UTC] chrisbreezy00: no
[2017-06-20 18:06:58 UTC] betheallen: jack i think that one is a MMO
[2017-06-20 18:07:02 UTC] mozoyvr: It's like you know he's doing something wrong, and you want to make it clear to him, but it doesn't quite get to him
[2017-06-20 18:07:05 UTC] betheallen: or whatever its called
[2017-06-20 18:07:07 UTC] chrisbreezy00: 11 is the MMO
[2017-06-20 18:07:10 UTC] jackwhite202: isnt 14 the mmo
[2017-06-20 18:07:14 UTC] dspfandood: zodiac age is okay
[2017-06-20 18:07:16 UTC] betheallen: ohhhh
[2017-06-20 18:07:21 UTC] betheallen: ok
[2017-06-20 18:07:24 UTC] errnoent: bethe is a mod???
[2017-06-20 18:07:27 UTC] errnoent: how in the hell..
[2017-06-20 18:07:27 UTC] chrisbreezy00: 12 has gameplay similar to an MMO but its single player
[2017-06-20 18:07:34 UTC] sanguinenite: any final fantasy that came after ff10 is not worth playing
[2017-06-20 18:07:40 UTC] jackwhite202: is the game good?
[2017-06-20 18:07:45 UTC] chrisbreezy00: and lets be honest 10 sucked to
[2017-06-20 18:07:49 UTC] chrisbreezy00: just not as much as the rest
[2017-06-20 18:07:49 UTC] mozoyvr: Example: Is it funny to call Fei Long "Fei Rong"? It's just outright cringy
[2017-06-20 18:07:53 UTC] jackwhite202: or should i not pick up zodiac age?
[2017-06-20 18:08:06 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Mozo why you hating on Fei Rong and Chun Ri?
[2017-06-20 18:08:19 UTC] jackwhite202: @MozoYVR well the japanesse read l as an r so
[2017-06-20 18:08:23 UTC] sanguinenite: honestly, all final fantasies sucked. it should have ended the first game
[2017-06-20 18:08:32 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Lets be honest the first game sucked to
[2017-06-20 18:08:34 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: Phil's awake and setting up stream it seems, seems to be back to normal with schedule
[2017-06-20 18:08:41 UTC] mozoyvr: No, just how he uses the stereotypical l-r pronunciation
[2017-06-20 18:08:47 UTC] jackwhite202: many people say 4 was the best
[2017-06-20 18:08:54 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Cecil was a cuck
[2017-06-20 18:08:56 UTC] akioartorius: 4 or 6 I guess
[2017-06-20 18:09:09 UTC] jackwhite202: most people will say 7
[2017-06-20 18:09:15 UTC] errnoent: any chat bots in here?
[2017-06-20 18:09:27 UTC] chrisbreezy00: 7 is probably the highest on the autism scale
[2017-06-20 18:09:36 UTC] chrisbreezy00: probably only could be surpassed by 8
[2017-06-20 18:09:41 UTC] akioartorius: so what is Dead by Daylight about?
[2017-06-20 18:09:44 UTC] mozoyvr: Seven says who?
[2017-06-20 18:09:47 UTC] sanguinenite: But people like shit - it is people like phil that are a minority in this world so it really shows the shit tier content people like SNL and their canned humour than some of DSP's content
[2017-06-20 18:10:06 UTC] chrisbreezy00: There are no funny people in the world
[2017-06-20 18:10:07 UTC] mozoyvr: Unedited kahntent.
[2017-06-20 18:10:09 UTC] jackwhite202: @MozoYVR the mainstream media
[2017-06-20 18:10:11 UTC] chrisbreezy00: because guess what humor is subjective
[2017-06-20 18:10:26 UTC] jackwhite202: they are the only ones who say ff7 is amazing
[2017-06-20 18:10:32 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: isn't comedy subjective? not everybody likes the same one thing for instance. We all find different ways to be entertained
[2017-06-20 18:10:39 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it's similar to Friday the 13th akio
[2017-06-20 18:10:43 UTC] jackwhite202: FF fans say 7 is ok/good
[2017-06-20 18:10:54 UTC] mozoyvr: I don't care about FF. I don't like fantasy settings for some reason.
[2017-06-20 18:11:04 UTC] chrisbreezy00: I mean FF fans like 9 which sucks so who cares what they say
[2017-06-20 18:11:22 UTC] jackwhite202: so in the end is FF as a series overrated?
[2017-06-20 18:11:23 UTC] sanguinenite: Wrong. Humour is universal. The key thing to be funny is to be honest and state the facts in the most ironic way possible. Which Phil does but when he does, it offends people who want to be offended and act like their opinions matter in this world.
[2017-06-20 18:11:31 UTC] akioartorius: @SanguineNite I don't get what you mean because Phil said he likes Final Fantasy or is what you are talking about unrelated to your previous comment
[2017-06-20 18:11:36 UTC] chrisbreezy00: but then again quality of games is subjective
[2017-06-20 18:11:39 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: humour is NOT universal.
[2017-06-20 18:12:05 UTC] spookywun: @SanguineNite LOL
[2017-06-20 18:12:06 UTC] chrisbreezy00: LOL humor is universal is the best joke so far i've seen today
[2017-06-20 18:12:07 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: there are a large variety of types of humour - whether it's a knock-knock joke, physical comedy, witty jokes etc
[2017-06-20 18:12:10 UTC] sanguinenite: @akioartorius My opnion of FF is my personal opjnion. there are SO many games phil plays I hate most of them
[2017-06-20 18:12:13 UTC] mozoyvr: Humor is universal, but its communication isn't. That's why there are different kinds of humor
[2017-06-20 18:12:25 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Sanguine then what kind of games do you like?
[2017-06-20 18:12:34 UTC] mozoyvr: To be honest, I try some games because Phil plays them. Like Scarface
[2017-06-20 18:12:38 UTC] chrisbreezy00: i mnean phil damn near plays every game
[2017-06-20 18:12:55 UTC] akioartorius: well he does now but not back then
[2017-06-20 18:13:05 UTC] skenkhuntt42: why are there so many trolls in this chat all the time
[2017-06-20 18:13:32 UTC] akioartorius: idk people create toxic communties?
[2017-06-20 18:13:46 UTC] mozoyvr: I'm here to chill, because it's hot- it seems- everywhere
[2017-06-20 18:13:57 UTC] errnoent: Why is everyone talking about FF?
[2017-06-20 18:14:03 UTC] banjogeek: Cuz KOW, EvilAJ, and DrgnKiller are a holes
[2017-06-20 18:14:11 UTC] akioartorius: How many degrees is it over where you are @MozoYVR
[2017-06-20 18:14:32 UTC] mozoyvr: 92 in Los Angeles
[2017-06-20 18:14:38 UTC] skenkhuntt42: @Banjogeek Don't know any of them nobodies.
[2017-06-20 18:14:48 UTC] akioartorius: @errnoent something about FF12 and then the topic expanded to FF opinions
[2017-06-20 18:14:49 UTC] sanguinenite: LOL chrisbreezy00's comment is funny because its stupid. Different kinds of humour is still humor but I guess trolls wouldnt get this basic concept. xD
[2017-06-20 18:15:01 UTC] errnoent: akioartorius FF12, such a long time ago..
[2017-06-20 18:15:04 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: well you hit the nail on the head, it's OPINIONS. No right answer
[2017-06-20 18:15:29 UTC] sanguinenite: Humour is humour Regardless of its form.. Calling it a different name is stupid.
[2017-06-20 18:15:35 UTC] mozoyvr: Sometimes Phil is genuinely funny. But most of the time it's unintentional
[2017-06-20 18:15:58 UTC] betheallen: here i am thinking having all the windows open will help me then i get nothing but hot air and FLIES coming in UGH
[2017-06-20 18:15:59 UTC] chrisbreezy00: phils legit rage is funny
[2017-06-20 18:15:59 UTC] sanguinenite: The beauty of it is unintentional and it seems trolls have issue with that. LOLOL
[2017-06-20 18:16:17 UTC] chrisbreezy00: his MAdden playthrough when he went up against the redskins
[2017-06-20 18:16:19 UTC] jackwhite202: of the main entries in the FF series which is the worst?
[2017-06-20 18:16:24 UTC] chrisbreezy00: was the perfect example of funny rage
[2017-06-20 18:16:39 UTC] akioartorius: @chrisbreezy00 hahahaha I remember that when the game crashed when he won the game
[2017-06-20 18:16:42 UTC] mozoyvr: I don't. But quality of play is... lacklustre.
[2017-06-20 18:16:50 UTC] sanguinenite: I dont watch for the rage, I watch for his honest commentary most other gaming commentators make me want to sleep.
[2017-06-20 18:16:52 UTC] 6th_moral: Yep
[2017-06-20 18:17:12 UTC] chrisbreezy00: most other game commentators honestly are like vanilla fucking ice cream
[2017-06-20 18:17:18 UTC] skenkhuntt42: Phil is the best gamer on twitch anyways all the other ones suck
[2017-06-20 18:17:18 UTC] chrisbreezy00: they are all the same just look different
[2017-06-20 18:17:30 UTC] spookywun: @SanguineNite so have you been here for his fighting streams? cause is basically just rage all the time
[2017-06-20 18:17:59 UTC] akioartorius: Phil has a pretty good record though in USF2
[2017-06-20 18:18:08 UTC] chrisbreezy00: not like it matters half the streams on twitch are the "gamer girls" getting free donations
[2017-06-20 18:18:15 UTC] jackwhite202: well he went to evo to play the game so
[2017-06-20 18:18:15 UTC] spookywun: he should he was a pro at it duh
[2017-06-20 18:18:26 UTC] sanguinenite: Conformity seems to be seen as a good thing. I think it is a terrible thing - which might explain why Phil has the obsessive crazy bunch stalking him the way they do.
[2017-06-20 18:18:37 UTC] mozoyvr: It would be better if he didn't complain about the same crap all the time. Lag, scrubs, bugs, glitches, problems that aren't there but it seems to be one for him
[2017-06-20 18:18:56 UTC] chrisbreezy00: THese are the same people that want him to quit twitch and get a real job at mcdonalds
[2017-06-20 18:18:58 UTC] errnoent: I really thought twitch was boring as hell until I saw Phil on it. Why the hell would you watch someone play a videogame that's not entertaining themselves? or someone that's putting on a front or a character or personality or something. No different than watching stupid reality tv shows. Maybe there are people out there that just like watching video games being played, no matter who's doing it
[2017-06-20 18:19:01 UTC] akioartorius: @MozoYVR you are forgetting game devs
[2017-06-20 18:19:12 UTC] jackwhite202: @chrisbreezy00 really mcdonalds?
[2017-06-20 18:19:19 UTC] mozoyvr: Yeah. Add that to the full buffett
[2017-06-20 18:19:22 UTC] darksydephil: hello all
[2017-06-20 18:19:25 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Yo phil
[2017-06-20 18:19:26 UTC] akioartorius: Hi pHil
[2017-06-20 18:19:27 UTC] mozoyvr: Morning
[2017-06-20 18:19:27 UTC] jackwhite202: hey phil
[2017-06-20 18:19:29 UTC] dinohans: hello phil
[2017-06-20 18:19:30 UTC] sanguinenite: Hey Phil
[2017-06-20 18:19:37 UTC] banjogeek: PHIL!!! HELLO MR. KING
[2017-06-20 18:19:43 UTC] flyeaglesfly01: Whats up
[2017-06-20 18:19:49 UTC] skenkhuntt42: the sky
[2017-06-20 18:19:51 UTC] nich2440: hey phil
[2017-06-20 18:19:54 UTC] jackwhite202: phil are you gonna play LawBreakers?
[2017-06-20 18:20:00 UTC] nich2440: This game is really fun
[2017-06-20 18:20:07 UTC] jackwhite202: it comes out August 8th for the pc and ps4
[2017-06-20 18:20:25 UTC] betheallen: hey phil
[2017-06-20 18:20:28 UTC] darksydephil: probably not, Lawbreakers doesn't look very good. and they're selling it at a budget price because they know it looks bad lol
[2017-06-20 18:20:29 UTC] betheallen: NEW GAME HYPE
[2017-06-20 18:20:45 UTC] jackwhite202: looks similar to overwatch
[2017-06-20 18:20:48 UTC] errnoent: What was the big twitch prime announcement? or have they not done it yet?
[2017-06-20 18:20:50 UTC] skenkhuntt42: this game isnt new
[2017-06-20 18:20:50 UTC] mozoyvr: Not all budget games are crap. Have you heard of Test Drive Unlimited?
[2017-06-20 18:20:58 UTC] akioartorius: @DarksydePhil do you remember your score yesterday?
[2017-06-20 18:21:01 UTC] darksydephil: twitch prime announcement is apparently in 40 minutes
[2017-06-20 18:21:08 UTC] errnoent: cool
[2017-06-20 18:21:25 UTC] nich2440: Are we going to wait to see what it is?
[2017-06-20 18:21:26 UTC] darksydephil: aw, no artwork for this game :(
[2017-06-20 18:21:27 UTC] chrisbreezy00: Twitch prime announcement hopefully is good
[2017-06-20 18:21:38 UTC] mozoyvr: One wave of his funny old stick, there's a light across the way
[2017-06-20 18:21:47 UTC] mastapoop: phil the new animation video of your hospital story is funny af
[2017-06-20 18:21:54 UTC] jackwhite202: @DarksydePhil are you still watching DBZ?
[2017-06-20 18:21:54 UTC] darksydephil: i dunno, the email they sent me was acting like its some HUGE news
[2017-06-20 18:21:59 UTC] betheallen: this one is harder than firday the 13th because you got to go around setting up generators to escape or you can find a hidden trap door to escape, not to mention all the different killers and micheal myers is in this game :D
[2017-06-20 18:22:08 UTC] spookywun: @DarksydePhil have you ever thought about getting sponsored by a PC company? Many of them sponsor channels than dont get as many viewers as you on twitch or youtube.
[2017-06-20 18:22:10 UTC] errnoent: I'm still amazed bethe is a mod
[2017-06-20 18:22:13 UTC] mozoyvr: In el court of the Crimson King
[2017-06-20 18:22:24 UTC] errnoent: with all of his korn talk :D
[2017-06-20 18:22:34 UTC] betheallen: errnoent korn

[2017-06-20 21:56:52 UTC] playcool18: F13 is more scary and leaves you at suspense than this, where you can escape death multiple tilmes

[2017-06-20 21:57:13 UTC] playcool18: with jason, you are done, here you can escape multiple times
[2017-06-20 21:57:14 UTC] thekasamoto: This game looks more interesting to play by myself. Friday 13th is more interesting to watch.
[2017-06-20 21:57:15 UTC] avocado_b: And dropping pallets while being chased is a good way to gain distance on the killer
[2017-06-20 21:57:15 UTC] rockstar0182: @DarksydePhil not owned you got raped

[2017-06-20 21:57:45 UTC] therealshakespeare: DBD wrecks F13 in their player base numbers even though F13 is a recent release and was super hyped
[2017-06-20 21:57:54 UTC] tulliuscicero25: ...okay
[2017-06-20 21:57:56 UTC] dead7shot: f13 can be good but it lacks too much content currently

[2017-06-20 21:58:45 UTC] playcool18: F13 looks more polished in the enviroment, and the stuff you can do, less content but more focused
[2017-06-20 21:58:45 UTC] therealshakespeare: and imo it's more fun/intense than F13 which is a janky, dissatisfying mess
[2017-06-20 21:58:46 UTC] whyso0o0serious4: Yea this game is very smooth

[2017-06-20 21:59:32 UTC] playcool18: this is far from intense I would say
[2017-06-20 21:59:33 UTC] therealshakespeare: the lobby isn't dumbass. it also sucks if you suck at the game.
