[2017-06-10 03:53:19 UTC] akioartorius: @hisui4 we don't talk about GT
[2017-06-10 03:53:29 UTC] veissvorra: lol
[2017-06-10 03:53:32 UTC] derichloveslemur: Lets go VenomousFatman and DarksydePhil!
[2017-06-10 03:53:32 UTC] rattlembonez: I think Dragon Ball is still one of the best anime of ALL TIME
[2017-06-10 03:53:37 UTC] derichloveslemur: I'm cheering for Both.
[2017-06-10 03:53:38 UTC] derichloveslemur: lol
[2017-06-10 03:53:51 UTC] rattlembonez: as far as stupid happiness it cant be beat I tell you
[2017-06-10 03:53:54 UTC] paradogred: gt is like the official bad fanfiction
[2017-06-10 03:54:05 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: I think I remember an episode of gx when I was younger where a little kid blew up a hospital he was in and I was sick to my stomach TearGlove
[2017-06-10 03:54:10 UTC] hisui4: i meant GT. woah did i seriously get Yu-Gi-Oh GX and DB GT confused?! and they both sucked. coincidence????
[2017-06-10 03:54:12 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, I'm rooting for you and Venomous. You guys are both awesome to me.
[2017-06-10 03:54:12 UTC] veissvorra: i think i read it was counted as an alternate timeline
[2017-06-10 03:54:28 UTC] jack_spartacus: cheer30
[2017-06-10 03:54:39 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Dragon Ball Super is a less shittier story than GT. Better than GT, but still not all that great.
[2017-06-10 03:54:40 UTC] rattlembonez: @hisui4 there was that hot girl in GX though so it was worth watching
[2017-06-10 03:54:41 UTC] xbrcat: so if i wanted to get into watching dragon ball just skip gt?
[2017-06-10 03:54:49 UTC] rattlembonez: yeah
[2017-06-10 03:54:54 UTC] vendatus: watch the last episode of Super ties into GT and Akira remakes it Kappa
[2017-06-10 03:55:02 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, Its awesome you got VenomousFatman
[2017-06-10 03:55:05 UTC] rattlembonez: unless you want pain don't watch it @xbrcat
[2017-06-10 03:55:08 UTC] derichloveslemur: He's such a awesome dood
[2017-06-10 03:55:08 UTC] veissvorra: GT is something you watch when you just want to see what it does
[2017-06-10 03:55:15 UTC] veissvorra: GT is not important for anything
[2017-06-10 03:55:30 UTC] hisui4: @rattlembonez lol i forgot her name but i know what you mean. i liked her too. I liked Jayden's character design.... and nothing else. lol.
[2017-06-10 03:55:41 UTC] akioartorius: Super Saiyan 4 was a cool thing I guess
[2017-06-10 03:55:51 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I think the part where Super became just wtf was when Trunks did that super spirit sword attack out of nowhere. Just made absolutely no sense, lol.
[2017-06-10 03:55:51 UTC] rattlembonez: I like the first episode of GT but after that its just sadness and anger
[2017-06-10 03:55:56 UTC] hisui4: @veissvorra true
[2017-06-10 03:56:01 UTC] vendatus: There was good in GT but covered in so much bad
[2017-06-10 03:56:05 UTC] wildmandan21: phil shouldnt use king hes not useing command throws and has no clue what ISW is
[2017-06-10 03:56:23 UTC] akioartorius: Phil is trying though
[2017-06-10 03:56:26 UTC] paradogred: seeing this make me want to read tiger mask manga again
[2017-06-10 03:56:48 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey @LemonPlaysGames
[2017-06-10 03:56:48 UTC] veissvorra: oh man @LemonPlaysGames the manga version of that fight so far is way more informative. So far no spirit sword nonsense
[2017-06-10 03:56:49 UTC] pureo_nikku: I'm p sure Phil won his first tournament with King
[2017-06-10 03:56:56 UTC] akioartorius: @paradogred Thats the manga I was trying to remember about King lol
[2017-06-10 03:57:01 UTC] vince329: @Wildmandan21 mastering King's command throws is one thing, mastering it in an online enironment is another XD
[2017-06-10 03:57:10 UTC] vince329: environment*
[2017-06-10 03:57:27 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @derichloveslemur, Yo. @VeissVorra It was really something in the anime. It was called like Spirit Bomb Sword or something?
[2017-06-10 03:57:30 UTC] hisui4: @akioartorius thats the only thing i liked about GT. Pan's character design, Super Saiyan 4's design, seeing kid goku again was nice, omega shenron vs ssj4 was pretty cool. everything else was crap.
[2017-06-10 03:57:41 UTC] wildmandan21: @Vince329 it took me 5 mins to learn aa basic hopkick bnb with insstaant shing wizard
[2017-06-10 03:57:41 UTC] veissvorra: yeah
[2017-06-10 03:57:43 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, You and Venomous are the best just to let ya know.
[2017-06-10 03:57:48 UTC] derichloveslemur: In my heart.
[2017-06-10 03:57:50 UTC] veissvorra: there was like no context for why it was a thing
[2017-06-10 03:57:56 UTC] veissvorra: just like trunk's transformation
[2017-06-10 03:57:57 UTC] veissvorra: lol
[2017-06-10 03:58:03 UTC] yaslothy: gg cavs you deserved the win
[2017-06-10 03:58:04 UTC] vendatus: but Baby Vegeta MingLee
[2017-06-10 03:58:06 UTC] vince329: @Wildmandan21 well then again, I don't play King so that's a thing XD
[2017-06-10 03:58:09 UTC] rattlembonez: @hisui4 seeing pilaf and gang again made me smile too

[2017-06-10 03:58:59 UTC] vendatus: WutFace
[2017-06-10 03:59:07 UTC] hisui4: @rattlembonez yeah the throwbacks were nice. its lioe they had a lot of cool concepts to work with but messed up the execution. totally botched it
[2017-06-10 03:59:08 UTC] pureo_nikku: Everyone knows Anna is better than Nina Kappa
[2017-06-10 03:59:09 UTC] kilroy700: You sure you're not just avoiding the rage because your opponent can actually hear you?
[2017-06-10 03:59:21 UTC] spiritxfullalchemist64: Anyone hyped for dragonball fighters?
[2017-06-10 03:59:26 UTC] veissvorra: i do like anna more;...
[2017-06-10 03:59:30 UTC] akioartorius: @Derichloveslemur They heard you and thanked you for the message

[2017-06-10 03:59:51 UTC] rattlembonez: @hisui4 the theme song never leaves either like it may be awful but you aren't getting it out of your head
[2017-06-10 03:59:53 UTC] crazycubedude: Co-Op would be really cool with him
[2017-06-10 03:59:55 UTC] yaslothy: Pops get Overwatch on PC and I'll hit you up on that
[2017-06-10 03:59:59 UTC] paradogred: Gon and Mokujin are always the best
[2017-06-10 04:00:00 UTC] vince329: and the last time he played a tekken was Revolution
[2017-06-10 04:00:01 UTC] derichloveslemur: @akioartorius Oh nice. Do you know everytime I host Venomous he says: Welcome to the squirtle squad!
[2017-06-10 04:00:09 UTC] neospartanhesperos9: Don't hurt her TearGlove
[2017-06-10 04:00:11 UTC] popsicolo: Nope WutFace
[2017-06-10 04:00:17 UTC] veissvorra: i wonder if tekken 7 will stop being a thing here once the new stuff comes out
[2017-06-10 04:00:19 UTC] vince329: i find it funny how Mokujin is the side selection icon but he's not in the game

[2017-06-10 04:00:54 UTC] popsicolo: Maybe If I ever get expendable income again.

[2017-06-10 20:04:24 UTC] kekon3: at least we can tell real people are playing
[2017-06-10 20:04:27 UTC] yaslothy: @Goldencolts She comes off fake as hell when it comes to games.

[2017-06-10 20:04:34 UTC] kekon3: literally no one knows what they're doing
[2017-06-10 20:04:36 UTC] hisui4: @electrogaming92 no i mean. despite whatever it is she does on youtube, she is the only one who can speak fluidly and professionally here. everyone else sounds nervous and fumbles their words. Thus proving they should be looking to hire professional speakers. Not random people who cave in on camera.
[2017-06-10 20:04:40 UTC] darksydephil: yeah at least this isn't scripted lol
[2017-06-10 20:04:40 UTC] misterdragin: prerecorded shit skipping forward?

[2017-06-10 20:05:16 UTC] yaslothy: jimmy? :o
[2017-06-10 20:05:16 UTC] blue_blur64: errnoent, hard to do that with 40 youtubers/twitch streamers
[2017-06-10 20:05:25 UTC] shadysands89: when is phil streaming?
[2017-06-10 20:05:29 UTC] goldencolts: thats so goofy
[2017-06-10 20:05:29 UTC] ornightz: yeah cause '13 EA was really friggin bad
[2017-06-10 20:05:32 UTC] drzombius: They announce No Man's Sky 2? Since all these sequels seem to have the same theme, have a POS first game, then release everything cut as a sequel. *looks at Destiny 2
[2017-06-10 20:05:33 UTC] elzorrobot: yoda has entered the battlefield!

[2017-06-10 20:05:45 UTC] oucme: its litt
[2017-06-10 20:05:46 UTC] darksydephil: ijustine has never added anything of quality to anything. she was in teh right place at the right time, she started "gaming" on youtube when it was becoming popular and bc she had a pretty face, all the fucking nerds watched her and she got famous based solely off of that. she's awful at games and is not any authority at anything, but she's good at speaking so she gets jobs like this
[2017-06-10 20:05:48 UTC] hisui4: @xthewrath93x lol i'm not saying she the best of the best. i'm saying everyone, at minimum, should be at the same speaking level as her. at the very least. not the fumbled mess i'm hearing these other two guys make.
[2017-06-10 20:05:49 UTC] glitch_crazed: @gdayguy36 tomorrow

[2017-06-10 20:06:34 UTC] stumpygee: we are all nerds watching her now Kappa
[2017-06-10 20:06:35 UTC] xthewrath93x: @hisui4 those other guys are just nervous but they cast games in esports at least im going to learn something than listening to some dumb broad only good for nothing
[2017-06-10 20:06:41 UTC] elzorrobot: and I've only been here for a month
[2017-06-10 20:06:43 UTC] mfd4419: Lul

[2017-06-10 20:06:55 UTC] darksydephil: just like toby turner, ijustice wasn't even doing gaming on youtube until it could be monetized. so ill just leave that there and yeah lol
[2017-06-10 20:06:57 UTC] god_revan_ryu: Is the feed blitzing forward?
[2017-06-10 20:07:02 UTC] zahvone: iJustice
[2017-06-10 20:07:05 UTC] shadysands89: its spazzing out for me
[2017-06-10 20:07:06 UTC] mfd4419: She's fine lol

[2017-06-10 20:07:17 UTC] bammbino: injustice on your mind huh?
[2017-06-10 20:07:19 UTC] gdayguy36: Hey i don't blame her. Make that money
[2017-06-10 20:07:19 UTC] a_lern: ijustice
[2017-06-10 20:07:22 UTC] betheallen: SHUT UP
[2017-06-10 20:07:25 UTC] xthewrath93x: dsp should be a caster
[2017-06-10 20:07:28 UTC] hisui4: @xthewrath93x i dont care what they do as a day job. their purpose here is to SPEAK to the viewer and advertise the game. they should be doing that well and if they can't, then why are they even here.
[2017-06-10 20:07:28 UTC] theycallmejimbob: calm down BeTheAllen

[2017-06-10 20:07:49 UTC] darksydephil: so this game looks good, but im already bored. you need a real gamer/commentator doing the gameplay for it to be good. jumping around makes it boring as you constantly get torn out of the situations
[2017-06-10 20:08:02 UTC] hisui4: @DarksydePhil exactly
[2017-06-10 20:08:03 UTC] lexad93: boring ...

[2017-06-10 20:08:14 UTC] xthewrath93x: @hisui4 are you listening to what im saying? their ACTUAL JOB is to cast games to new viewers. what credentials does injustice have for this kind of business? nothing
[2017-06-10 20:08:14 UTC] somethingyer2: yeah and they are only showing third person
[2017-06-10 20:08:14 UTC] yaslothy: how long is this conference?
[2017-06-10 20:08:14 UTC] disagreeablers: wish it was only like 10min
[2017-06-10 20:08:15 UTC] mfd4419: Dat buff
[2017-06-10 20:08:15 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil commentate for us! live thoughts on the gameplay is what we love from you!
[2017-06-10 20:08:17 UTC] praisemysuns: I just hate how they're using the same engine as battlefield so it'll feel exactly the same.
[2017-06-10 20:08:19 UTC] glitch_crazed: @darksydephil same Phil
[2017-06-10 20:08:19 UTC] kekon3: I think a problem is long winded shooter maps like these aren't that good for stage plays
[2017-06-10 20:08:22 UTC] lvlpower: no sound excited
[2017-06-10 20:08:28 UTC] elzorrobot: it's boring because the gameplay is boring
[2017-06-10 20:08:28 UTC] electrogaming92: thank god tomorrow the real e3 begins im already sleepy to wake up for e3 tomorrow lol
[2017-06-10 20:08:31 UTC] elzorrobot: dice has done it agai

[2017-06-10 20:08:33 UTC] gabriel_ko: There's no environment destruction?
[2017-06-10 20:08:35 UTC] betheallen: sloth microsoft conference is at 10pm
[2017-06-10 20:08:35 UTC] hisui4: @xthewrath93x then based on what i'm hearing right now at this moment. they need a new job. lol/

[2017-06-10 20:08:54 UTC] hisui4: this is so boring. these guys' voices are tuning me out.
[2017-06-10 20:08:55 UTC] the_thagarus: They'd have been better off showing single player honesty
[2017-06-10 20:08:58 UTC] bammbino: the gameplay is fine, but the cameraman is showing stupid shit for the sake of showing other things
[2017-06-10 20:08:58 UTC] blk_mage_ctype: Like 25-30 minutes.
[2017-06-10 20:09:00 UTC] yaslothy: SeemsGood
[2017-06-10 20:09:00 UTC] hyperior21: They sound so robotic.
[2017-06-10 20:09:01 UTC] hisui4: can't they just finish this and move on?
[2017-06-10 20:09:02 UTC] elzorrobot: cool concept (star wars) bad gamplay (dice)

[2017-06-10 20:09:28 UTC] bammbino: what a noob
[2017-06-10 20:09:29 UTC] xthewrath93x: @hisui4 injustine hasnt said one thing thats worth listening too 'oh yeah thats happening' doesnt count LMAO.. those other guys are ACTUALY CASTING
[2017-06-10 20:09:32 UTC] god_revan_ryu: These results feel rigged and made up
[2017-06-10 20:09:35 UTC] betheallen: this looks the same as the first
[2017-06-10 20:09:38 UTC] betheallen: geez

[2017-06-10 20:09:52 UTC] praisemysuns: So basically theres only scripted destruction, as opposed to BF1 where you can atleast blow up alot of shit
[2017-06-10 20:09:54 UTC] bammbino: those little bullets did that? ResidentSleeper

[2017-06-10 20:31:00 UTC] shogo6_6: I'll say this right now though the biggest disappointment of the E3 press conference for me was the fact that they had a five-second reveal teaser for a game that looked like Dead Space 4 and then at the end of it they said they're going to reveal it with the Xbox Scorpio
