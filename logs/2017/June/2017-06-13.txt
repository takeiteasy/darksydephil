Since when shit hits the fan for your business, you drop all of your "morals" and everything you spat shit at other youtubers for. What f***ing clown you are.

[2017-06-13 00:40:39 UTC] jagar87: i will check it out later
[2017-06-13 00:41:20 UTC] burnout26: Bethesda was a 2/10
[2017-06-13 00:41:56 UTC] blue_blur64: Like, the only things I know about Bethesda right now are Skyrim for Switch having Zelda amiibo support and Fallout VR
[2017-06-13 00:42:14 UTC] burnout26: well there is wolfenstein
[2017-06-13 00:43:00 UTC] deep_drive: devolver digital is best of e3 even though it wasn't live Kappa

[2017-06-13 00:48:59 UTC] blue_blur64: I just saw your forum post burnout. What the fuck is going on with that? xD
[2017-06-13 00:49:08 UTC] blue_blur64: That can't be the actual price
[2017-06-13 00:49:20 UTC] captaindcw9514: Do you guys think they made a horizon zero dawn sequel
[2017-06-13 00:49:35 UTC] blue_blur64: Not at this point captain
[2017-06-13 00:49:43 UTC] zdub55: you know what would be crazy if they made a new bioshock.
[2017-06-13 00:49:45 UTC] captaindcw9514: Darn
[2017-06-13 00:50:06 UTC] blue_blur64: There's no way they'd have a sequel already presentable, if they're even making one at this time
[2017-06-13 00:50:30 UTC] thedatacluster: anyone here?
[2017-06-13 00:50:34 UTC] captaindcw9514: @blue_blur64 true
[2017-06-13 00:50:43 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm honestly not sure what to expect from Sony this year.
[2017-06-13 00:50:45 UTC] burnout26: Well I wouldnt be surprised if it is real though. The disk must be made of gold for that price.
[2017-06-13 00:50:48 UTC] kushiyakitori: most we'll see about Horizon is an expansion/dlc

[2017-06-13 00:53:35 UTC] suckasurprise: I hope Sony is going to drop some crazy bombshells but I'm sure they're just going to show stuff no one really cares about (i.e. Knack 2)
[2017-06-13 00:53:58 UTC] dooley258: Apparently Knack 2 is coming

[2017-06-13 20:41:29 UTC] seashanty: @Idunnpoweredup It doesn't matter if you're pro or not, it was EXTREMELY common to rotate the stick too quick and not get your input regardless of who you are. You're wrong. Go into SF4, pick common Ryu, do his Metsu Hadoken as fast as possible and see how often it comes out
