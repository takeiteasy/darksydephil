[2017-06-18 18:33:52 UTC] pcgamehunter: Only Walking dead I cared about was Telltales
[2017-06-18 18:34:14 UTC] akioartorius: I am pretty sure 99% of us would die if there was a zombie outbreak.
[2017-06-18 18:34:27 UTC] yaslothy: But remember you've watched all the WD episodes vs. none of the GOT episodes and that's what you're basing it off of.

[2017-06-18 18:55:39 UTC] pcgamehunter: Tears are free lubricant maaan Kappa
[2017-06-18 18:56:00 UTC] yaslothy: Tears for Fears was a good band.
[2017-06-18 18:56:01 UTC] pcgamehunter: I literally can't stop making that joke, since Two and Half men FailFish
[2017-06-18 18:56:07 UTC] yaslothy: *listens to Mad World*
[2017-06-18 18:56:09 UTC] yaslothy: TearGlove

[2017-06-18 18:56:24 UTC] akioartorius: I find it kinda funny I find it kinda sad
[2017-06-18 18:56:24 UTC] goldencolts: phils hot sauce was too hot?
[2017-06-18 18:56:45 UTC] yaslothy: Philip doesn't seem to like spicy things.
[2017-06-18 18:56:49 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: I was considering that myself @theycallmejimbob but if it'd been planned, Phil would've said in advance. So could be he forgot it was Father's Day, maybe
[2017-06-18 18:56:54 UTC] pcgamehunter: In fact tears wouldn't be a good lubricant, the fucking sodium would just cause more friction, especially if it dries up DansGame
[2017-06-18 18:57:07 UTC] pcgamehunter: Wait what are we talking about ... Kappa

[2017-06-18 19:02:37 UTC] yaslothy: Jesus broccoli stinks. Goddamn.
[2017-06-18 19:02:38 UTC] conky89: The animation in One Piece is horrible these days. Just read the manga folks
[2017-06-18 19:02:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I'll never understand people who spend hundreds of bucks on steam badges
[2017-06-18 19:02:49 UTC] pcgamehunter: George RR Martin is making it hard right now Kappa

[2017-06-18 19:04:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: With most of the games on steam you get a card drop if you play for 30 mins or so if you collect for example 5 cards you can craft a badge PC. The badges give you XP some people spend hundreds/thousands to have the highest steam level
[2017-06-18 19:04:28 UTC] derichloveslemur: Hey @akioartorius

[2017-06-18 19:07:21 UTC] conky89: I have heard some people say that hard difficulty is actually more difficult then merciless due to the increase chance of critical hits both ways
[2017-06-18 19:07:24 UTC] pcgamehunter: Sheogorath calls Pizza restaurant Kappa
[2017-06-18 19:07:25 UTC] adentros: XD

[2017-06-18 19:44:29 UTC] vlayer: Cause of based Deep Silver, which is weird since Sega owns Atlus and has a European branch...

[2017-06-18 20:05:50 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: I'm honestly confused at the amount of editing required for fan-submitted content - I thought the point of them sending this was so Phil wouldn't have to edit them?
[2017-06-18 20:05:51 UTC] 0megaj0ker: plus the ads were appearing in videos that are distasteful videos
[2017-06-18 20:05:56 UTC] sonicwe: also YT did fuck themselfs cause they way too damn automated

[2017-06-18 20:06:27 UTC] pcgamehunter: If youtube actually wanted to fix that, theyd start removing the videos that take away their advertizers tho.
[2017-06-18 20:06:45 UTC] pcgamehunter: So that would be even worse, but that would be better for them.
[2017-06-18 20:06:50 UTC] thesaurusboy: that would be bad

[2017-06-18 20:07:26 UTC] lost_in_technicolor: Depends on where in the South. The more desert like areas are better. Like New Mexico and Arizona and Southern Cali. I live in Central Texas and allergies are pretty bad. Oak and Pine...
[2017-06-18 20:07:35 UTC] pcgamehunter: The other method would still make them some money vs no money now ...
