[2017-06-22 18:06:30 UTC] sanguinenite: lol yeah I wonder if it is a medical condition at this point
[2017-06-22 18:07:57 UTC] zahvone: Nah
[2017-06-22 18:08:10 UTC] zahvone: Anyone who has ever had a computer in their life, or plays video games knows the struggle
[2017-06-22 18:08:14 UTC] zahvone: He's probably stressed out as well
[2017-06-22 18:08:32 UTC] sanguinenite: After 4 hours of streaming, he isnt tired yet?
[2017-06-22 18:08:41 UTC] zahvone: It's not about that
[2017-06-22 18:08:47 UTC] zahvone: You can be tired or sleepy and still not be able to sleep
[2017-06-22 18:08:58 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: to me, it's quite startling that he talks of getting a rush of adrenaline from either doing laundry or cleaning his house. This is normal shit that adults do not get adrenaline from lol
[2017-06-22 18:09:15 UTC] zahvone: When did he say that?
[2017-06-22 18:09:27 UTC] sanguinenite: in his twitter I think
[2017-06-22 18:09:30 UTC] zahvone: Hm
[2017-06-22 18:09:35 UTC] leokira997: he said it on a prestream
[2017-06-22 18:09:59 UTC] zahvone: Well, in perspective, the human body was meant to move and do stuff. I'm not saying he doesn't do anything, because I don't know his personal life
[2017-06-22 18:09:59 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: last few nights. He said he was up late before cos he done a bunch of laundry, and it gave him an adrenaline rush. And he said he was late last night cos he was in upstairs-cleaning mode, which also filled him with adrenaline - his words
[2017-06-22 18:10:01 UTC] zahvone: BUT
[2017-06-22 18:10:28 UTC] zahvone: Yeah it's possible there's a thyroid thing there, or his body is just spitting out adrenaline for no reason
[2017-06-22 18:10:34 UTC] zahvone: because of random increase in activity
[2017-06-22 18:10:39 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: he is mainly stationary for the majority of each day. His usual schedule, according to him, is going out once a week to do shopping and stuff?
[2017-06-22 18:10:48 UTC] zahvone: It's actually not so uncommon dspHmm
[2017-06-22 18:10:55 UTC] coralguy: I know when I'm doing various tasks throughout my place late at night I find it difficult to unfocus and relax
[2017-06-22 18:11:10 UTC] zahvone: I agree, @coralguy
[2017-06-22 18:11:28 UTC] zahvone: My problem however, is that I'm hyper analytical and my brain activity is always through the roof.
[2017-06-22 18:11:34 UTC] sanguinenite: As I said, it might be a health problem and he needs to find cures for himself. Most white collared workers are stationary except for travel which is no more than 1 hour.
[2017-06-22 18:12:01 UTC] zahvone: If it's a health issue, there is no cure. It'll be something along the lines of "get more activity in your day, or try to"
[2017-06-22 18:12:02 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: still in disbelief neither Phil nor Leanna cleaned the house once in 3 years properly. That's just blowing my mind.
[2017-06-22 18:12:13 UTC] sanguinenite: @Zahvone I dont believe that
[2017-06-22 18:12:15 UTC] zahvone: Small increments to help his body release energy instead of giving him adrenaline
[2017-06-22 18:12:26 UTC] sanguinenite: I have been able to find ways to get myself to fall asleep if I must
[2017-06-22 18:12:30 UTC] zahvone: @hotsauceistoohot Lol your name is great btw
[2017-06-22 18:12:38 UTC] zahvone: @SanguineNite Yes, but each person is different.
[2017-06-22 18:12:48 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: thanks, shout-out to Frank's red hot hot sauce, tasty with chicken but too damn hot
[2017-06-22 18:12:49 UTC] zahvone: Your body is vastly different from his, as well as your life style.
[2017-06-22 18:12:55 UTC] zahvone: lmao
[2017-06-22 18:13:08 UTC] sanguinenite: probably mine's a lot healtheir, no offense to phil of course
[2017-06-22 18:13:10 UTC] zahvone: Personally I'm a BBQ man myself.
[2017-06-22 18:13:21 UTC] zahvone: Hm
[2017-06-22 18:13:38 UTC] zahvone: A healthier mind is easier to the temptations of sleep.
[2017-06-22 18:13:42 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: Phil has a back issue which makes him not able to do much regardless - it's just that I don't believe doing as little as he SEEMS to do is good for him. A half-hour walk every evening around his area might be of great benefit to him
[2017-06-22 18:14:43 UTC] zahvone: @hotsauceistoohot I have another friend with the exact same back problem (If I'm not mistaken) and nerve damage in her arm, and she also doesn't want to irritate the pain at all. I completely understand it, but at the same time it' sjust one of those things where people can do what they want with their body, yeah?
[2017-06-22 18:14:55 UTC] zahvone: I honestly keep forgetting he has back pain. Doesn't talk about it much like he used to
[2017-06-22 18:15:16 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: what was it exactly, a herniated disc or something?
[2017-06-22 18:15:40 UTC] zahvone: It's been so long, I'm not sure. :(
[2017-06-22 18:16:04 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hello hello

[2017-06-22 18:16:42 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: but I think 12:30 is the new time from now on
[2017-06-22 18:17:21 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey hotsauce yeah I seen that his allergies must of been acting up again
[2017-06-22 18:17:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: is he finished with DBD now?
[2017-06-22 18:18:29 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: @Zahvone going back to the back - no pun intended - we don't really know how debilitating Phil's back actually is. I remember, once upon a time ago, one reason for moving was so Leanna could help Phil recover from surgery he was considering getting for his back. But when they moved, the 'Seattle Air' worked its magic and he decided against it.
[2017-06-22 18:18:33 UTC] coralguy: I hope so, in glad he was having fun but I sure didn't like the game

[2017-06-22 18:20:23 UTC] zahvone: @hotsauceistoohot Punny. I mean, I suppose it isn't so unheard of? I mean he really doesn't talk about it at all anymore. Like at all. I think he's mentioned it 2, maybe 3 times since he moved. Maybe his back was just sore from being a bachelor Kappa

[2017-06-22 18:20:56 UTC] zahvone: *shrug*
[2017-06-22 18:20:56 UTC] leokira997: revolver is better tbh BeTheAllen
[2017-06-22 18:21:06 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I agree coralguy it was fun to watch but I suppose the novelty was wearing off after a few sessions
[2017-06-22 18:21:12 UTC] betheallen: nah it has tank controls
[2017-06-22 18:21:18 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: well he says it's still an issue - back during one of his emergency vlogs, a live one he did on here, he said he cannot do uber as he cannot drive on freeways because of his back. He can't get a job that would involve him being too physical cos of his back.
[2017-06-22 18:21:38 UTC] leokira997: nah it has a story and actually stars red in the game
[2017-06-22 18:21:52 UTC] zahvone: Actually, and I don't mean this to be offensive in anyway but
[2017-06-22 18:22:00 UTC] zahvone: Has Phil thought about getting disability or anything?...
[2017-06-22 18:22:15 UTC] zahvone: Though I guess now that I ask hat, it's not really for us to know.
[2017-06-22 18:22:18 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if he was claiming it already, at least in the past
[2017-06-22 18:22:29 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: hell Rambo was with him during conventions to carry Phil's shit, cos Phil struggled with it
[2017-06-22 18:22:32 UTC] zahvone: Well he definitely should.
[2017-06-22 18:22:39 UTC] betheallen: red dead redemption has a story, who cares about red
[2017-06-22 18:22:47 UTC] leokira997: i mean, if he was, i dont see why its something that should be kept as a secret, its something that doesnt really matter but if he was i feel he would tell us
[2017-06-22 18:23:02 UTC] leokira997: red was cool
[2017-06-22 18:23:06 UTC] zahvone: Pride perhaps? A lot of people really don't like discussing it sadly.
[2017-06-22 18:23:18 UTC] leokira997: i meeean
[2017-06-22 18:23:28 UTC] zahvone: Personally I think we need better coverage in this country for people with health issues and veterans
[2017-06-22 18:23:30 UTC] zahvone: BBUUUT
[2017-06-22 18:23:35 UTC] zahvone: I also realize it's not magic. Lol
[2017-06-22 18:24:10 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: Phil's half-truths and things, get him easily in trouble though. Take yesterday - we do not NEED to know he got a package sent to him. We know he did though, cos he told us. Won't say what it is. Why tell us? Was it expensive? Is he splurging? Is it a blow-up doll to watch movies with him? It's none of our business but he invites questions by telling us he got a package delivered haha
[2017-06-22 18:24:37 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: when he would've been better off not divulging that at all, as he has no intention of saying what it was clearly
[2017-06-22 18:24:38 UTC] zahvone: Well, I mean everyone does that?
[2017-06-22 18:24:40 UTC] zahvone: lol
[2017-06-22 18:24:55 UTC] zahvone: He's just making casual conversation and I think people are reading into it so much that it becomes a "lie"
[2017-06-22 18:25:15 UTC] sanguinenite: Rambo was guilty too. And I am saying this as an honest critic of phil, I dont always agree with everyone he does but I surely dont go out of my way to spin whatever little info about him to look like Hitler
[2017-06-22 18:25:21 UTC] leokira997: i personally dont understand the point of bringing something up then not giving any further information
[2017-06-22 18:25:38 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: if Phil wasn't asking people to tip, cheer, give through Patreon etc, it wouldn't be an issue. But we get the pay-bills speech, the keep-me-doing-this speech, and then he's telling us he's getting shit sent to him - it's easy for the mind to jump to conclusions, even if unfairly
[2017-06-22 18:25:42 UTC] zahvone: @LeoKira997 Well if I said I went to the bathroom, would you also like all of the details?
[2017-06-22 18:25:49 UTC] leokira997: "ive been waiting for this pakcage for 3 days" "what is it" "none of your business" what?
[2017-06-22 18:25:58 UTC] zahvone: Lol
[2017-06-22 18:25:58 UTC] cocoadroppa: Zahvone ! My nigga !
[2017-06-22 18:26:05 UTC] zahvone: COCOA wassap man
[2017-06-22 18:26:11 UTC] leokira997: if youre back in like a minute i know you took a piss, if you gone for a few i know you did more
[2017-06-22 18:26:20 UTC] leokira997: thats simple
[2017-06-22 18:26:25 UTC] zahvone: Maybe I'm a fast fapper, who knows Kappa
[2017-06-22 18:26:33 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: @LeoKira997 exactly, nobody needed to know he got a fucking package lol. It just invites people to wonder.
[2017-06-22 18:26:33 UTC] leokira997: oh the camreas on
[2017-06-22 18:26:35 UTC] sanguinenite: Well it is none of your business. If it was his toilet paper or dildo collection, it is his own business that I dont care to know. The only ones that do care are the sok
[2017-06-22 18:26:35 UTC] zahvone: All jokes aside, I don't worry about stuff he does off stream so much
[2017-06-22 18:26:44 UTC] zahvone: Oh christ what have I done to this chat lol
[2017-06-22 18:26:52 UTC] leokira997: nothing
[2017-06-22 18:26:55 UTC] leokira997: this is chat
[2017-06-22 18:27:01 UTC] sanguinenite: lol the trolls are so involved in phil's life, more so than his own subscribers like zahvone lol
[2017-06-22 18:27:06 UTC] zahvone: Haha
[2017-06-22 18:27:18 UTC] zahvone: I think people feel entitled, is the issue. The real issue.
[2017-06-22 18:27:26 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: 'the trolls' have been fairly quiet lately actually. Nothing worth talking about to be honest
[2017-06-22 18:27:31 UTC] zahvone: "I've watched you for x years, and then you never said hi" or something along those lines.
[2017-06-22 18:27:43 UTC] leokira997: i mean i just hear him say one thing and then later deny he said that thing, thats my issue really
[2017-06-22 18:27:52 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: well he contradicts himself a lot
[2017-06-22 18:27:55 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: but that's Phil
[2017-06-22 18:28:08 UTC] zahvone: He probably does it because he doesn't want people to bring it up. It's embarrassment or something.
[2017-06-22 18:28:12 UTC] leokira997: something i really do not understand though
[2017-06-22 18:28:17 UTC] zahvone: I mean you've been caught in a lie before and denied it, yeah? lol
[2017-06-22 18:28:18 UTC] leokira997: why does he use the laptop?
[2017-06-22 18:28:21 UTC] zahvone: "I heard you like me"
[2017-06-22 18:28:22 UTC] leokira997: he has a perfectly good pc
[2017-06-22 18:28:26 UTC] zahvone: "No I don'tttt"
[2017-06-22 18:28:32 UTC] zahvone: Laptop is closer
[2017-06-22 18:28:34 UTC] leokira997: and that office of his is arranged horribly
[2017-06-22 18:28:35 UTC] zahvone: portable
[2017-06-22 18:28:59 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: that laptop is always left on, no wonder it's dying
[2017-06-22 18:29:12 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: hell look at the people online, it says Phil is - cos he leaves the laptop on, always.
[2017-06-22 18:29:23 UTC] zahvone: Actually I am curious though, but how is Phils parents doing? He used to talk about them so much lol
[2017-06-22 18:29:33 UTC] leokira997: idk, ask him
[2017-06-22 18:29:47 UTC] zahvone: He'd be offended
[2017-06-22 18:29:48 UTC] leokira997: you might get told why you wanna know about his parents but maybe not
[2017-06-22 18:29:48 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: he called his dad a day before Father's Day to wish him all the best - so that's something
[2017-06-22 18:29:54 UTC] zahvone: assume I'm probably out to get him lol
[2017-06-22 18:30:25 UTC] leokira997: seriously though back to his pc, he has a 4930k, why he is using the laptop for everything i wont understand
[2017-06-22 18:30:53 UTC] zahvone: What you didn't know is that Phil uses his desktop as an eSports machine
[2017-06-22 18:30:53 UTC] leokira997: take the pc outside and dust it out rearrange the office and he could have things setup nicely
[2017-06-22 18:30:55 UTC] zahvone: :o
[2017-06-22 18:31:11 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: it's a matter of convenience. He enjoys reading stream chat while playing the consoles, and banning @theycallmejimbob
[2017-06-22 18:31:21 UTC] zahvone: LOL
[2017-06-22 18:31:32 UTC] sanguinenite: You try streaming using 1 desktop and run to another desktop to monitor and interact with chat occasionally to tell off mods or trolls. @LeoKira997 the troll xD
[2017-06-22 18:31:32 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :D
[2017-06-22 18:31:33 UTC] zahvone: NotLikeThis
[2017-06-22 18:32:03 UTC] theycallmejimbob: that was pretty funny yesterday in fairness poor Slothy got banned and Phil didn't know how to unban him
[2017-06-22 18:32:10 UTC] zahvone: Unfortunately I do stream with one desktop. Though, I'm not nearly as big. I only have 90 followers (and I do appreciate every single one) BUT I need a new pc. this one is dying still ;c
[2017-06-22 18:32:13 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: if Phil was smart he'd have console next to PC set up - but I think he is too set in his ways, that love seat is his main gaming seat. A computer chair won't do it for him
[2017-06-22 18:32:23 UTC] akioartorius: @Zahvone Esports? Phil? No way? Phil doesn't even like Esports he siad
[2017-06-22 18:32:25 UTC] akioartorius: said
[2017-06-22 18:32:35 UTC] leokira997: snaguine i do, because i have things setup correctly
[2017-06-22 18:32:37 UTC] zahvone: @akioartorius He definitely likes eSports.
[2017-06-22 18:32:38 UTC] zahvone: :P
[2017-06-22 18:32:45 UTC] leokira997: id post a link but id be timedout
[2017-06-22 18:32:47 UTC] theycallmejimbob: did anyone ask while he was dusting did he pick up the game that shall not be named behind his loveseat
[2017-06-22 18:32:47 UTC] sanguinenite: If you trolls know how to do things better than phil, why are you guys having less success? XD
[2017-06-22 18:32:57 UTC] leokira997: because i dont care?
[2017-06-22 18:33:15 UTC] zahvone: @SanguineNite Because I'm still brand new. Learning. Observing. Rubbing
[2017-06-22 18:33:19 UTC] zahvone: I mean trying.
[2017-06-22 18:33:21 UTC] zahvone: Kappa
[2017-06-22 18:33:39 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: I'm not attempting to be a full-time streamer. I have a good job, a good girlfriend and a good life. And I play games whenever just to chill. Simple @SanguineNite :P
[2017-06-22 18:33:42 UTC] sanguinenite: no because all trolls cant XD thats why they resort to trolling someone else better than they are. lol
[2017-06-22 18:34:03 UTC] sanguinenite: @hotsauceistoohot for having a real job, you sure do have a lot of free time to waste
[2017-06-22 18:34:10 UTC] zahvone: I don't want to be full time streamer, but I'd love to do it as a hobby
[2017-06-22 18:34:13 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: dude it's 7:30pm lol
[2017-06-22 18:34:15 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: I'm finished
[2017-06-22 18:34:32 UTC] sanguinenite: lol do you stalk him on the night stream too?
[2017-06-22 18:34:38 UTC] zahvone: :o
[2017-06-22 18:34:43 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: stalk him? Excuse me?
[2017-06-22 18:34:49 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: I'm usually sleeping cos I'm up at 6am
[2017-06-22 18:34:54 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you do a good job streaming Zahvone keep up the good work
[2017-06-22 18:35:14 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: being here watching Phil on twitch is talking now, who knew
[2017-06-22 18:35:22 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: stalking*

[2017-06-22 18:36:08 UTC] sanguinenite: wow most people that have a real job got more entertaining stuff to do like going to expensive restaurants and playing golf. What the heck are you doing wasting your time trolling a guy trying to make a living playing games? xD sound so unbelievable
[2017-06-22 18:36:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: on a sidenote Zahvone rayman legends is 50% off for the steam sale ;)
[2017-06-22 18:36:30 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: lol expensive restaurants? Playing golf? You're clearly not an adult dude
