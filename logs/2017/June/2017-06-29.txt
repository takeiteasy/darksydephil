[2017-06-29 20:38:59 UTC] bethebaby: @ai_izumi It's HORRIBLE.
[2017-06-29 20:39:00 UTC] sanguinenite: but still

[2017-06-29 20:39:05 UTC] nich2440: now what?
[2017-06-29 20:39:19 UTC] darksydephil: it's always a good sign when during your first contact with a real estate agent, they get your name completely wrong despite you just telling them what it is
[2017-06-29 20:39:25 UTC] dspgamingislegit: Fallout is shrek Fallout 4 is love.
[2017-06-29 20:39:28 UTC] voltron3d: when's the next Injustice 2 online matches?
[2017-06-29 20:39:34 UTC] yaslothy: Pheel

[2017-06-29 20:39:44 UTC] frag_boy: wait phil...thats a BAD sign?!
[2017-06-29 20:39:46 UTC] ai_izumi: @bethebaby Sure its not as good as fallout 3 in terms of story but I think its gorgeous on PC
[2017-06-29 20:39:53 UTC] frag_boy: lol

[2017-06-29 20:39:57 UTC] chem_zegarra2018: Thoughts on Patreon vs donations?
[2017-06-29 20:40:09 UTC] sanguinenite: phil, what are you talking about? about the chat here or the chat with your real estate agent over the phone?
[2017-06-29 20:40:10 UTC] voltron3d: the streets spell names correctly
[2017-06-29 20:40:17 UTC] nich2440: what's minimum wage in the US?
[2017-06-29 20:40:19 UTC] darksydephil: in my experience, real estate agents are super busy people who get pulled in a ton of directions and can't really focus. must be a super stressful job
[2017-06-29 20:40:34 UTC] zaxbys_sauce: are you selling your washington condo?
[2017-06-29 20:40:35 UTC] dspgamingislegit: What are real estate angents thi?

[2017-06-29 20:40:45 UTC] hotsauceistoohot: I assume this is regarding the CT home rather than the WA home, Phil
[2017-06-29 20:41:02 UTC] bethebaby: @ai_izumi Who cares what it looks like? It's a poor game. Its writing it sloppy, riddled with holes, it lacks depth, features that NV launched with had to be added through DLC, the only meaningful DLCs were Far Harbor and Nuka-World; the game *sucks*.
[2017-06-29 20:41:04 UTC] sanguinenite: @Chem_Zegarra2018 the difference is that you get a kick back on patreon, though I agree not all creators give fair kick backs for the supporters
[2017-06-29 20:41:15 UTC] dspgamingislegit: BTW, r.i.p Tupac Skular.

[2017-06-29 20:42:22 UTC] sanguinenite: yeah IKR @hotsauceistoohot
[2017-06-29 20:42:26 UTC] errnoent: HERE WE GO
[2017-06-29 20:42:27 UTC] ai_izumi: One of my friends is in the real estate business and he says its one of the most stressful jobs especially when there are people who are rude to him
[2017-06-29 20:42:30 UTC] yaslothy: @Nich2440 it depends state to state
[2017-06-29 20:42:31 UTC] nich2440: it's 15 in Canada
[2017-06-29 20:42:32 UTC] dspgamingislegit: Red Dead Redemption.

[2017-06-29 20:42:38 UTC] yaslothy: @Nich2440 where i live it's 9.75
[2017-06-29 20:42:40 UTC] sanguinenite: I think minimum jobs is bullshit
[2017-06-29 20:42:44 UTC] dspgamingislegit: HE'S LIVEEEE..
[2017-06-29 20:42:47 UTC] sanguinenite: minimum wage
[2017-06-29 20:42:53 UTC] errnoent: real estate is some of the most brainless shit you can do to get rich
[2017-06-29 20:43:11 UTC] errnoent: aside from maybe "catch me outside"
[2017-06-29 20:43:16 UTC] ai_izumi: @errnoent not if you do it right *wink*
[2017-06-29 20:43:26 UTC] dspfandood: someone is jelly
[2017-06-29 20:43:32 UTC] ai_izumi: Which means also do some pretty shady shit
[2017-06-29 20:43:41 UTC] sanguinenite: to have a minimum wage is to say that the free market is failing and not working, especially it is a mild form of communism, demanding to be paid even tho the output is not worth as much
[2017-06-29 20:43:49 UTC] dspgamingislegit: Hey DSP
[2017-06-29 20:43:59 UTC] dspfandood: hello

[2017-06-29 20:44:07 UTC] yaslothy: lol where's chris?
[2017-06-29 20:44:18 UTC] yaslothy: I want him to challenge me to a fight in Russia
[2017-06-29 20:44:54 UTC] sanguinenite: I find it hilarious that some streamers want to pretend pol/relig doesnt exist and want ppl to avoid bringing it up. It is related to life and not all streams are so interesting that ppl wouldnt mention it, even for a little bit.

[2017-06-29 22:08:06 UTC] skenkhuntt42: oh this is a different one? @Deep_Drive

[2017-06-29 22:08:59 UTC] dspfandood: beth cult gtfo
[2017-06-29 22:09:00 UTC] capitalist_pepe: @ai_izumi It doesn't help when people constantly mention it in his stream chat whenever no one is being a detractor.
[2017-06-29 22:09:05 UTC] masterxeon2002: I can't tell bethe would near constantly change his name on irc back in the day :P
[2017-06-29 22:09:09 UTC] capitalist_pepe: Even if it did hurt his buisness

[2017-06-29 22:10:18 UTC] drac456: why would you ever expect a turn on in a twitch stream involving phil
[2017-06-29 22:10:25 UTC] xgameofpwns: "detractor" is a specific term for someone who specifically is out to troll DSP...people can still be trolls but not detractors
[2017-06-29 22:10:26 UTC] dspfandood: mally pepe and wrath are detractors BAM. I have a detractor radar

[2017-06-29 22:10:51 UTC] sanguinenite: @Capitalist_Pepe if anyone mentions the trolls, it is because we hope that commonsense will be knocked into their heads. sooner or later, ppl will stop bringing it up because we realise that the trolls are willful losers.

[2017-06-29 22:12:24 UTC] nerozero88: @ai_izumi how does it taste?
[2017-06-29 22:12:25 UTC] sanguinenite: @Capitalist_Pepe when I first came here, I tried but then I realised that they are completely hopeless. Now if I do mention them it is only to get them banned or make fun of them. xD
[2017-06-29 22:12:28 UTC] mrpapaveraceae: Phil does garner some of the strangest trolls I've ever seen any other LPers have. There should be a documentary made on it, cause it still puzzles me.

[2017-06-29 23:09:20 UTC] sanguinenite: @Sonicb00m actually the point of a chat is to share differing views about different subject. since I lean on the side of a positive view of phil, I stay and talk about other things. I dont have to necessarily agree with phil for everything that he does lol

[2017-06-29 23:10:17 UTC] deep_drive: Nice
[2017-06-29 23:10:18 UTC] errnoent: "cuck" is a pronoun that identifies the person using the pronoun as an idiot
[2017-06-29 23:10:23 UTC] sanguinenite: @Xgameofpwns glad that you agree :)
[2017-06-29 23:10:28 UTC] sonicb00m: @sanguinenite right back at you!
[2017-06-29 23:10:39 UTC] crimsonkoenig: the people who give money to phil need to ask themself 1 question. if you were in a life death situation and you need 100$ to survive, would phil give it to you?

[2017-06-29 23:11:25 UTC] hyperior21: @Crimsonkoening He says "If you like what I am doing. If you want to see me keep me doing this full time" a guilt tip would be if he said something like "You guys aren't really my fans if you don't support me". Learn the difference.

[2017-06-29 23:12:05 UTC] xthewrath93x: yes pubg is good
[2017-06-29 23:12:06 UTC] sanguinenite: seriously some people cannot deal with the fact that not everyone shares their petty little opinions. these people need to grow up
[2017-06-29 23:12:29 UTC] sonicb00m: @sanguinenite besides I can justify my view if I want

[2017-06-29 23:15:09 UTC] craigybhoy94: I have a question, if Phil is constantly complaining about his financial situation, why doesn't he just go part time and get a real job? Or is that just too much work
[2017-06-29 23:15:10 UTC] eternia_forever: lol @theycallmejimbob

[2017-06-29 23:40:45 UTC] atlusinyourass: cheer10 Me again Phil; I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE if you were offended by my other tips. I did NOT mean to come off as a troll. I'm actually an ex-employee of Atlus Japan's legals department. When I heard of the Persona 5 stuff, and your strike, I felt a need to express my concern, given how Atlus Japan operates with legal affairs. AJ has a history of holding strikes. That's why I am DEEPLY WORRIED for DSPGaming; the longer it takes for the strike to be removed, the more likely it will not.
[2017-06-29 23:40:49 UTC] atlusinyourass: That's why I mentioned Curse; they don't remove partners ASAP over a strike but MAY do so if the strike is left for a month. MY SUGGESTION? File a class action lawsuit. AJ will NOT back down from a private lawsuit, and can spend the cash to make a point, to a degree. A CA would force their hand financially and possibly remove the strike 100%. It'd also cover expenses between you and the other claimants, AND you can settle for $ compensation since CAs draws more litigation pressure.
