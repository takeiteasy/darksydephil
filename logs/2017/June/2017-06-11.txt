[2017-06-11 22:44:51 UTC] pcgamehunter: Sony basically got the heads-up on the consoles, during the time everything is on PC. And now there is almost no reason to get a console over a PC. And there is even less reason to get a Xbox over a Playstation FailFish
[2017-06-11 22:44:51 UTC] scoopula: Anthem will play 10x better on PS4 anyway

[2017-06-11 22:49:56 UTC] bigtone995: Seriously phil don't do it lol you'd have to play battlegrounds to really judge it
[2017-06-11 22:49:57 UTC] eliskor: Most of the interesting games you can play elsewhere LUL No need for an Xbox One yet
[2017-06-11 22:49:57 UTC] mythstorm24: I mean I like playing it with friends.

[2017-06-11 22:50:20 UTC] hisui4: microsoft was faaarr better than EA.. But its still really meh. i spent most of the time feeling bored. and stupid minecraft
[2017-06-11 22:50:23 UTC] mythstorm24: you really need to play it a lot to get it.
[2017-06-11 22:50:25 UTC] praisemysuns: @ral241 Seriously? what was the most impressive thing, I don't get it. No actual console exclusives, one game in 60fps, lots of platformers. I dont really see what the major hype was about.

[2017-06-11 22:51:11 UTC] bigtone995: No new elder scrolls for a few more years sorry lol
[2017-06-11 22:51:13 UTC] pureo_nikku: yeah it looked cool @OmenHoudini
[2017-06-11 22:51:14 UTC] dooley258: They didn't say that the multiplats will run in true 4K
[2017-06-11 22:51:19 UTC] darkviking159: Anthem looks sick as fuck
[2017-06-11 22:51:23 UTC] yaslothy: @katexo234 I thought it was pretty decent...could have been better but things really impressed me.

[2017-06-11 22:51:45 UTC] ewojo: I couldn't watch the press conference on my laptop because it kept cutting out
[2017-06-11 22:51:45 UTC] pcgamehunter: @PraiseMySuns yup, even the morrowind dlc didn't make people care much
[2017-06-11 22:51:47 UTC] mightyprime1: Anthem is titanfall 3!!
[2017-06-11 22:51:48 UTC] bomber_man_mulayim: Well Ori is going to be in 4K! cant wait!
[2017-06-11 22:51:49 UTC] shogo6_6: Anthem looks like a pretty cool game and everything from what I've seen so far but to be honest it's really hard to read what the game is and what the requirements will be as far as how does it work. It looks like one of those games where there's going to be heavy emphasis on multiplayer and Co-op style gameplay rather than having a standard single player offline capable campaign
[2017-06-11 22:51:49 UTC] yaslothy: ESO is dead?
[2017-06-11 22:51:58 UTC] pcgamehunter: @ewojo lucky bastard MingLee
