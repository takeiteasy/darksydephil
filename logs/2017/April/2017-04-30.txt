[2017-04-30 19:06:51 UTC] betheallen: lol jimbob should be 1 buck
[2017-04-30 19:07:03 UTC] stevensonbilista: revolution 60 should have been pirated. I hope Phil didn't actually pay 10 bucks for that
[2017-04-30 19:07:10 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey @DarksydePhil
[2017-04-30 19:07:20 UTC] breckinridge1821: Rev 60 is malware basicly
[2017-04-30 19:07:27 UTC] stevensonbilista: Essentially
[2017-04-30 19:07:29 UTC] darksydephil: okay, so today's stream will be in 720p 60fps
[2017-04-30 19:07:37 UTC] darksydephil: since none of these games actually run in 1080
[2017-04-30 19:07:41 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, Can you remember if Scarface was 1080p or 720?
[2017-04-30 19:07:52 UTC] akioartorius: 720? prob
[2017-04-30 19:07:54 UTC] podusmonens: boooooo

[2017-04-30 19:08:02 UTC] darksydephil: scarface is 720p, it was an xbox game, 1080p didnt exist for regular games
[2017-04-30 19:08:06 UTC] renastella: 720 is fine

[2017-04-30 19:09:07 UTC] akioartorius: your sry
[2017-04-30 19:09:09 UTC] howlinthedeep: most terrible games were made a long time ago
[2017-04-30 19:09:19 UTC] ratchefan12: @Derichloveslemur our closer blew it last night and we lost
[2017-04-30 19:09:40 UTC] betheallen: bethebaby be careful of the dog :D
[2017-04-30 19:09:41 UTC] breckinridge1821: if you want some bad games, just buy the $1 games on Steam
[2017-04-30 19:09:46 UTC] conky89: There will always be terrible games each generation.
[2017-04-30 19:09:54 UTC] darksydephil: yeah akioartorius someone found an actual contact form for facebook and they unlocked my account
[2017-04-30 19:10:05 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Is the stream Live?
[2017-04-30 19:10:47 UTC] howlinthedeep: Nice Phil just don't spam your friends with farmville requests to join
[2017-04-30 19:10:53 UTC] conky89: Man Steam really has no quality control with all these cheaply made crappy games. I mean i get that they want the work of people to be available to others but they really are not worth the money
[2017-04-30 19:11:08 UTC] stuart360: Maybe not terrible games but there are a lot more 'generic' games today than in past gens imo
[2017-04-30 19:11:09 UTC] betheallen: hhahhahaahhaahhaha deep
[2017-04-30 19:11:18 UTC] derichloveslemur: Facebook is a awesome social media platform
[2017-04-30 19:11:29 UTC] darksydephil: okay
[2017-04-30 19:11:35 UTC] 0megaj0ker: does that mean Phil can play his Final Fantasy game?
[2017-04-30 19:11:41 UTC] darksydephil: im going to start the stream, then use the restroom, then tweet we're live nad then get started
[2017-04-30 19:11:43 UTC] conky89: We live in a generation of open world games and crappy first person simulator games
[2017-04-30 19:11:43 UTC] darksydephil: in that order lol
[2017-04-30 19:11:51 UTC] popsicolo: Gold PogChamp
[2017-04-30 19:11:55 UTC] stuart360: Steam are changing their rules soon when it comes to Indie games, its going to be a lot more strickter when it comes to what they allow onn Steam
[2017-04-30 19:11:58 UTC] betheallen: no pre stream?

[2017-04-30 19:12:44 UTC] betheallen: im never gunna see scarface before i go
[2017-04-30 19:12:45 UTC] conky89: That is good because this is reminding me of the NES days when the library was full of crappy games with no quality control
[2017-04-30 19:12:54 UTC] twitchnotify: 2 viewers resubscribed while you were away!
[2017-04-30 19:13:00 UTC] burnout26: lobosGoldBlank hey pop
