[2017-04-14 18:19:10 UTC] poorlymade: Play Scarface, people seem really hyped about that playthrough.

[2017-04-14 18:19:38 UTC] errnoent: Phil if you're barely scooting by with this then it might be a good idea to look into some other form of passive income that would allow you to continue streaming full time.
[2017-04-14 18:19:51 UTC] goldencolts: you should try playing a big twitch game like h1z1 battle royale or playerunknown battlegrounds phil
[2017-04-14 18:19:59 UTC] poorlymade: Is it possible to have Leanna advance forward with some of your playthroughs and have extra footage?
[2017-04-14 18:20:01 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: It's a big time investment to stay up to date on RPG playthroughs and most people don't have the time
[2017-04-14 18:20:12 UTC] darksydephil: brb getting drinks, then we'll start
[2017-04-14 18:20:14 UTC] derichloveslemur: Shall we get ready?

[2017-04-14 18:32:09 UTC] darthvidarviking: that is right phil :D
[2017-04-14 18:32:12 UTC] ornightz: Listen you still should be careful , play it safe ... do 7/7 story offline just to see if it won't get claimed
[2017-04-14 18:32:14 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @DarksydePhil, one bigger streamer got a 7 day streaming ban for going past 7.7
[2017-04-14 18:32:19 UTC] codenameone: I think "fair use" gets blurry when you make a profit off the work.
[2017-04-14 18:32:30 UTC] zuadjin517: cant we stop bitching and just play the freakin game
[2017-04-14 18:32:40 UTC] conky89: Lets plays are a bit of a grey area i find. You have to remember that one does not own most of the assists in the game
[2017-04-14 18:32:45 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, Saturday is your 7th anniversary right?
[2017-04-14 18:32:47 UTC] kinggoken: something big must happen at 7/7

[2017-04-14 18:33:08 UTC] realazyria: no he didn't
[2017-04-14 18:33:09 UTC] shimmernuts: @darksydephil , just so u know theres ppl waiting around for u to hit 7/7 so they can notify atlas and get u in trouble, seems very petty.
[2017-04-14 18:33:22 UTC] conky89: Atlas has to eventually lift the ban
[2017-04-14 18:33:26 UTC] markymark52: Phil's opinion is not really valid on the subject because of conflict of interest.
[2017-04-14 18:33:40 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil I can't wait for your 7th Anniversary on saturday

[2017-04-14 18:34:08 UTC] cherry_dood: Not gonna talk about these people anymore tho
[2017-04-14 18:34:10 UTC] markymark52: he's going to have a biased opinion because he earns income from playthroughs.
[2017-04-14 18:34:16 UTC] darthvidarviking: well if you think content is offencive you can choose not to watch it ;)

[2017-04-14 18:34:41 UTC] jaxunhero: @darksydephil I've heard people say that the ban should lift one month later but nothing concrete sadly.
[2017-04-14 18:34:41 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil So you created DSPGaming in April 15th, 2010 correct? 7th Anniversary tomorrow!

[2017-04-14 18:35:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: My mistake. I thought he got a week long ban for that
[2017-04-14 18:35:24 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I know he was putting up fake titles so no one would know it was Persona 5
[2017-04-14 18:35:29 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and he got caught
[2017-04-14 18:35:34 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, 7th Anniversary of DSPGaming HYPE?
[2017-04-14 18:35:37 UTC] clesstheangei: you won't see the ending (or what happens) of the 3rd dungeon if you don't go past the third dungeon

[2017-04-14 18:38:41 UTC] akioartorius: @0megaj0ker , why did I just think of giant spiders when you said Australia?
[2017-04-14 18:38:43 UTC] conky89: Man telltale pops out games like two bopping bunnies. Then again their games are not graphically intensive and have little gameplay so its not surprising

[2017-04-14 18:40:44 UTC] shindigpsc: Phil, as someone who reviews games, once that code is available for consumption, the developer is saying this product is ready for criticism.

[2017-04-14 18:41:18 UTC] blk_mage_ctype: It would be fine if they'd at least edit the review or print a retraction.

[2017-04-14 18:42:09 UTC] shindigpsc: How else would you suggest games get promoted? People need to know ahead of time in this pre-order culture?
[2017-04-14 18:42:12 UTC] clesstheangei: The way i see it, when you make a review, you should review it after the day 1 patch. Makes no sense to review a game that doesn't reflect the way the game is when it releases, when normal people get the game
[2017-04-14 18:42:13 UTC] vendatus: SwiftRage

[2017-04-14 18:42:46 UTC] cherry_dood: It's the developers own fault to releasing review copies. They bring it on themselves. If I send out chicken to a reviewer and its raw, I can't say "Well it wasn't the finished product. Not my fault you got sick."

[2017-04-14 18:45:19 UTC] blk_mage_ctype: To be fair, Bethesda has a pretty poor track record for releasing their games in a bug-free state.

[2017-04-14 18:45:42 UTC] eliskor: Think for yourself...aka agree with Phil. Look, dude, they reviewed what they were given. That's all they could do. Maybe they should update their reviews to reflect the game as it is NOW. That would be a good idea.

[2017-04-14 20:05:20 UTC] mythstorm24: what above Twitch
[2017-04-14 20:05:28 UTC] jwalker70: Capcom isnt that bad IMO
[2017-04-14 20:05:29 UTC] areyoushivering: im a shapshifter
[2017-04-14 20:05:36 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's called Beneath the mask, and there are 4 version, for rain and without and with vocals or without
[2017-04-14 20:05:49 UTC] derichloveslemur: @blue_blur64 Atlus must be dumb right?
[2017-04-14 20:05:52 UTC] mythstorm24: Yeah but lower than Nintendo because all Nintendo does is demonetize
[2017-04-14 20:06:13 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, at least with Nintendo they're still allowing you to make videos
[2017-04-14 20:06:17 UTC] conky89: Copyright law is different in Japan. So you can blame the Japan studios for copyright nonsense
[2017-04-14 20:06:20 UTC] euffy: Lovely lyrics but who picked this singer...
[2017-04-14 20:06:24 UTC] derichloveslemur: @blue_blur64 but the 7/7 is BS lol
[2017-04-14 20:06:26 UTC] mythstorm24: that's my ideology
[2017-04-14 20:06:32 UTC] blue_blur64: The composer of course Euffy
[2017-04-14 20:06:35 UTC] blue_blur64: Shoji Meguro
[2017-04-14 20:06:47 UTC] euffy: It's easily my most hated thing in this game.
[2017-04-14 20:06:51 UTC] areyoushivering: @Euffy the manager is her dad/boyfriend Kappa
[2017-04-14 20:06:53 UTC] popsicolo: I'm a shaft-shifter. KappaPride
[2017-04-14 20:07:01 UTC] blue_blur64: Really? I think she's the best singer out of the three in the series
[2017-04-14 20:07:02 UTC] tulliuscicero25: you do realize anyone can play the game as long as they want right?
[2017-04-14 20:07:06 UTC] euffy: @akioartorius Seriously? Explains a lot...
[2017-04-14 20:07:14 UTC] mythstorm24: Did Phil say if Persona 5 is getting content id
[2017-04-14 20:07:14 UTC] pcgamehunter: Honestly I understand why spoilers are bad for Persona 5, there are already spoilers showing up on the YT comments. But it's not like twitter can't spoil you faster than video could.
[2017-04-14 20:07:26 UTC] derichloveslemur: @MythStorm24 no
[2017-04-14 20:07:28 UTC] tulliuscicero25: it affects like maye 10% of total players
[2017-04-14 20:07:30 UTC] conky89: Can you record gameplay offline and put it online past 7/7?
[2017-04-14 20:07:40 UTC] popsicolo: They should've gotten Lotus juice to sing this song. KappaHD
[2017-04-14 20:07:43 UTC] blue_blur64: Nope, can't have videos past 7/7 either
[2017-04-14 20:07:44 UTC] mythstorm24: No it's in game date
[2017-04-14 20:07:49 UTC] conky89: Ah
[2017-04-14 20:07:55 UTC] mythstorm24: Not July 7th 2017
[2017-04-14 20:08:00 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Popsicolo wassup1
[2017-04-14 20:08:07 UTC] conky89: I know it is the in game date
[2017-04-14 20:08:10 UTC] popsicolo: KonCha
[2017-04-14 20:08:14 UTC] randomron005: Honestly, there should really be no problem with streaming it. If anything, it's free exposure.
[2017-04-14 20:08:23 UTC] mythstorm24: Atlus should have at least specified when videos could go up past 7/7
[2017-04-14 20:08:27 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Popsicolo How was Overwatch the other day?
[2017-04-14 20:08:39 UTC] blue_blur64: Well maybe they will never allow it
[2017-04-14 20:08:55 UTC] pcgamehunter: Nah
[2017-04-14 20:08:55 UTC] jwalker70: If I don't want to be spoiled I wont watch the LP
[2017-04-14 20:08:56 UTC] conky89: That would just be stupid of Atlus to never allow it
[2017-04-14 20:08:57 UTC] euffy: To me the singers seems someone who has experienced life (old would be the rude word) while the game seems to be the youth vs the adults. I wished for a more rebellious voice.
[2017-04-14 20:09:03 UTC] mythstorm24: Right? I'm going to buy Persona 5 after this and I've never played a Persona game before.
[2017-04-14 20:09:11 UTC] popsicolo: It was pleaseant.
[2017-04-14 20:09:14 UTC] popsicolo: Derich
[2017-04-14 20:09:23 UTC] pagepro: So the steam is just sitting here running ads.
[2017-04-14 20:09:26 UTC] pcgamehunter: They will definitely lift it or at least stop enforcing it once Persona 6 comes out Kappa
[2017-04-14 20:09:26 UTC] areyoushivering: @Euffy like what, gg Allin? Kappa
[2017-04-14 20:09:34 UTC] pcgamehunter: so like ? 7 years Kappa
[2017-04-14 20:09:34 UTC] blue_blur64: Eh, I've never really had the singer represent the theme of the game
[2017-04-14 20:09:49 UTC] mxtt10589: is there still a 7/7 ban on the Japanese version? When did it end?
[2017-04-14 20:09:50 UTC] euffy: @areyoushivering Like P4 rap singer, Backside of the TV.
[2017-04-14 20:09:54 UTC] blue_blur64: It didn't end
[2017-04-14 20:10:06 UTC] randomron005: I mean I don't see myself playing this because my dislike for Turn-Based Combat. But you're getting free exposure of your game.
[2017-04-14 20:10:10 UTC] errnoent: damn this repetitive music
[2017-04-14 20:10:18 UTC] popsicolo: LOTUS JUICE PogChamp
[2017-04-14 20:10:24 UTC] errnoent: There's like 3 total songs in this game
[2017-04-14 20:10:35 UTC] areyoushivering: but theyre all good
[2017-04-14 20:10:35 UTC] blue_blur64: Way more than that errnoent lol
[2017-04-14 20:10:41 UTC] jmon_1985: You guys do realize that streaming may bring in customers, it also takes them away
[2017-04-14 20:10:42 UTC] pcgamehunter: The singer is good, but like most JP singers their English isn't great
[2017-04-14 20:10:48 UTC] areyoushivering: for fapping Kappa
[2017-04-14 20:10:54 UTC] blue_blur64: There's over 60 at least
[2017-04-14 20:10:58 UTC] pcgamehunter: Theres like 135 tracks total
[2017-04-14 20:11:04 UTC] randomron005: Okay, Phil. Please come back from your Burger Break. This song is getting annoying.
[2017-04-14 20:11:07 UTC] blue_blur64: Ok, thanks pc for the clarification lol
[2017-04-14 20:11:10 UTC] pcgamehunter: The soundtrack has some repeating or dif versions
[2017-04-14 20:11:11 UTC] euffy: The songs without lyrics are cool
[2017-04-14 20:11:22 UTC] errnoent: That's interesting pcgamehunter blue_blur64. Then why do we keep hearing the same 3 over and over again? :D
[2017-04-14 20:11:34 UTC] pagepro: Why not turn the stream off if you are going to be away for so long.
[2017-04-14 20:11:36 UTC] blue_blur64: Because you'll usually hear the night and day themes
[2017-04-14 20:11:42 UTC] blue_blur64: Those aren't going to change
[2017-04-14 20:11:44 UTC] conky89: There are people who like to watch people play videogames rather than play them themself
[2017-04-14 20:11:45 UTC] pagepro: This is just milking the viewers
[2017-04-14 20:11:49 UTC] derichloveslemur: Hello!
[2017-04-14 20:11:52 UTC] mythstorm24: Because only those play when Phil takes breaks! Kappa
[2017-04-14 20:11:55 UTC] pcgamehunter: Yeah the casual day, night time tracks are repeating as are mementos and combat
[2017-04-14 20:12:06 UTC] areyoushivering: the red and black flag in the background... dsp is an anarcho-communist confirmed Kappa
[2017-04-14 20:12:10 UTC] conky89: But many have said that lets plays motivated them to purchase a game
[2017-04-14 20:12:10 UTC] pcgamehunter: But there are a ton of tracks for cutscenes, bosses etc ...
[2017-04-14 20:12:25 UTC] errnoent: It's just these are the ones you hear 90% of the time
[2017-04-14 20:12:27 UTC] errnoent: while you're playing the game
[2017-04-14 20:12:35 UTC] jmon_1985: @pagepro not doing anything makes people stay?
[2017-04-14 20:12:59 UTC] areyoushivering: @pagepro hes not allowed to take a piss?
[2017-04-14 20:13:14 UTC] pcgamehunter: True, they did start the lyrics from like May, but they should have done a few more for the day and night roaming tbh
[2017-04-14 20:13:39 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey @jmon_1985 and @areyoushivering
[2017-04-14 20:13:40 UTC] pcgamehunter: Still I like these, they're better than the ones in the previous 2 imo
[2017-04-14 20:14:23 UTC] derichloveslemur: hello?
[2017-04-14 20:14:28 UTC] pcgamehunter: BTW anyone notice the cinema music is music from Catherine :D

[2017-04-14 20:21:17 UTC] mythstorm24: @darksydephil Your playthrough made me go out and buy the collector's edition of Persona 5
[2017-04-14 20:21:18 UTC] pcgamehunter: Yeah remember when Ryuji said he felt better after the toiler, you're feeling that now Kappa
[2017-04-14 20:21:20 UTC] areyoushivering: "breaking"
[2017-04-14 20:21:23 UTC] twitchnotify: TheKinginYell0w just subscribed with Twitch Prime!

[2017-04-14 20:21:41 UTC] availableusername888: deligful shit makes life bearable
[2017-04-14 20:21:46 UTC] popsicolo: That was me Euffy
[2017-04-14 20:22:02 UTC] jwalker70: You spoiled it for him!!!
[2017-04-14 20:22:04 UTC] thekinginyell0w: Hi Phil
[2017-04-14 20:22:06 UTC] ssjram: @DarksydePhil Keep in mind that the game is over 100 hours.
[2017-04-14 20:22:09 UTC] akioartorius: cheer10, my brother Kohaku told me to tell you hi and to keep being yourself.
[2017-04-14 20:22:20 UTC] euffy: @Popsicolo Did you do the Nioh one too?
[2017-04-14 20:22:21 UTC] chocorampage: @DarksydePhil as this is my first persona would you say so far this is the best persona game in the series?
[2017-04-14 20:22:32 UTC] euffy: The one that looked a bit DBZ?
[2017-04-14 20:22:34 UTC] akioartorius: I know the cheer didn't work. it was on purpose
[2017-04-14 20:22:52 UTC] damienelmaskador: integrity
[2017-04-14 20:22:55 UTC] djruno1: how much did i miss?
[2017-04-14 20:23:00 UTC] gola2222: Name of the song Phil
[2017-04-14 20:23:01 UTC] damienelmaskador: I agree
[2017-04-14 20:23:07 UTC] darthvidarviking: cheer10 stop being yourself immediately
[2017-04-14 20:23:10 UTC] popsicolo: Maybe Euffy. I was trying to make it look like Japanese woodblock.
[2017-04-14 20:23:16 UTC] pcgamehunter: I think Atlus might have done the ban, after consulting YT and Twitch, that there would be like 7billion zetta bytes of Persona 5 footage Kappa
[2017-04-14 20:23:22 UTC] marktactics: Same here. Would love more free days
[2017-04-14 20:23:23 UTC] euffy: @Popsicolo Loved that one btw.
[2017-04-14 20:23:25 UTC] pcgamehunter: Because it's so long
[2017-04-14 20:23:31 UTC] popsicolo: Thanks TriHard
[2017-04-14 20:23:33 UTC] damienelmaskador: and its hard to grind you have to grind at Mementos cause the Palaces disappear
[2017-04-14 20:23:36 UTC] chocorampage: @DarksydePhil everyone i know is telling me the same thing. man this game is awesome
[2017-04-14 20:23:52 UTC] popsicolo: I'm 70 hours in and I don't feel burnt out.
[2017-04-14 20:23:53 UTC] blue_blur64: you technically don't need to grind damien
[2017-04-14 20:23:58 UTC] damienelmaskador: there are Rare Personas and if you miss them you cant complete the compendium
[2017-04-14 20:24:02 UTC] randomron005: Hurry up and start! This music is starting to get annoying!
[2017-04-14 20:24:07 UTC] conky89: It is a shame that some people don't want to play this game simply due to its anime look...
[2017-04-14 20:24:10 UTC] blue_blur64: They appear in mementos as well
[2017-04-14 20:24:12 UTC] euffy: I'm at 45 hours myself.
[2017-04-14 20:24:18 UTC] marktactics: Hope Atlus will lift its 7/7 curse eventually
[2017-04-14 20:24:22 UTC] rationalperson: Trial by burger
[2017-04-14 20:24:23 UTC] pcgamehunter: Also if you DO grind, don't do it in mementos, do it in full dungeons that have varied music lol
[2017-04-14 20:24:32 UTC] pcgamehunter: And more enemies in one spot
[2017-04-14 20:24:33 UTC] jwalker70: Enjoy it while it lasts
[2017-04-14 20:24:33 UTC] dspfandood: teacher has best perks
[2017-04-14 20:24:36 UTC] mythstorm24: Yes
[2017-04-14 20:24:38 UTC] chocorampage: lockpicks ftw
[2017-04-14 20:24:43 UTC] euffy: Noooo no lockpicks!
[2017-04-14 20:24:45 UTC] damienelmaskador: Blue Blur: Like the Regent? I didnt find the Regent in Mementos
[2017-04-14 20:24:47 UTC] euffy: It rains, rain is good for stats.
[2017-04-14 20:24:51 UTC] akioartorius: lockpicks, diner, burger, or maid
[2017-04-14 20:25:16 UTC] blue_blur64: I did damien
[2017-04-14 20:25:19 UTC] marktactics: The best time to make lockpicks is before the day you get the treasure
[2017-04-14 20:25:25 UTC] damienelmaskador: how? I wanna know
[2017-04-14 20:25:26 UTC] conky89: Yet you always lose the lockpick once it is used. Does it disintegrate or something?
[2017-04-14 20:25:29 UTC] errnoent: lmfao
[2017-04-14 20:25:32 UTC] pcgamehunter: I wish special lockpick imported to NG+ T_T
[2017-04-14 20:25:40 UTC] blue_blur64: They're one time use lockpicks conky
[2017-04-14 20:25:42 UTC] euffy: Regent is in Mementos, found several.
[2017-04-14 20:25:43 UTC] damienelmaskador: I dont wanna pay for Regent every time and he's like useful for fusions
[2017-04-14 20:25:53 UTC] jwalker70: They don't even let you buy shit or take out libary books in this next few days if I recall
[2017-04-14 20:25:55 UTC] pcgamehunter: More like toothpicks with how fast they break
[2017-04-14 20:26:01 UTC] conky89: Videogame logic: Lockpicks and Keys disappear after being used once
[2017-04-14 20:26:19 UTC] pcgamehunter: @DarksydePhil There is a chance you make more than one lockpick that's why you make them individually
[2017-04-14 20:26:23 UTC] conky89: Could you imagine that in real life?
[2017-04-14 20:26:34 UTC] damienelmaskador: With more Proficiency you can make more
[2017-04-14 20:26:37 UTC] akioartorius: Lockpicks are fragile and keys are thrown away
[2017-04-14 20:26:38 UTC] pcgamehunter: lol would never leave my house conky

[2017-04-14 21:04:34 UTC] liesuponlies: Phil does know he still has to pay taxes on the money right?

[2017-04-14 21:04:45 UTC] conky89: It makes sense. You are doing a service and getting paid for it
[2017-04-14 21:04:48 UTC] yacherdy: PogChamp
[2017-04-14 21:04:59 UTC] lioncock: he literally just said he pays taxes on his tips, surely your ears arent that bad?

[2017-04-14 21:05:37 UTC] pcgamehunter: Yeah US the worst when it comes to tipping, it's like 20% or whatever. In Europe it's like you leave a bit of change based on how you liked the service. Japan has no tips
[2017-04-14 21:05:46 UTC] lioncock: im sure youre recording the show to use against him so listen back to the archives and youll hear him say he pays taxes on tips
[2017-04-14 21:06:03 UTC] akioartorius: @DarksydePhil , remember that the yusuke link is on 6/18

[2017-04-14 21:06:26 UTC] blue_blur64: lies, we understand that
[2017-04-14 21:06:29 UTC] liesuponlies: "To be clear, just because you don't receive a form 1099-K or form 1099-MISC doesn't mean that you get a pass on reporting the income: it's still taxable, form or no form."
[2017-04-14 21:06:30 UTC] tourwithme: tipping is dumb
[2017-04-14 21:06:32 UTC] damienelmaskador: if you tip in Japan they would try to discreetly give it back :D

[2017-04-14 21:08:07 UTC] sensoji: In the UK, fancy restaurants can add a service charge to your final bill, but you can request to reduce it or take it off. Some places will add a service charge if you have a large group of people show up.
[2017-04-14 21:08:08 UTC] jmon_1985: Fuck that I don't report my tips
[2017-04-14 21:08:23 UTC] randomron005: Tips are taxable only if they reach a certain threshold.
