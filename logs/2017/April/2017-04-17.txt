[2017-04-17 18:20:34 UTC] 0megaj0ker: has anyone seen the "water bubble" that's been getting some popularity lately?

[2017-04-17 18:21:13 UTC] lioncock: it was fun i guess but fallout 4 was a disappointment for me. I wasnt interested in the base building tbh
[2017-04-17 18:21:13 UTC] yacherdy: Fallout 4 is good SeemsGood
[2017-04-17 18:21:23 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey everybody in chat1
[2017-04-17 18:21:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey derich
[2017-04-17 18:21:39 UTC] lioncock: the story wasnt as strong as id like but its a fun game as long as you go in with the objective to enjoy it
[2017-04-17 18:21:42 UTC] podusmonens: games crash on pcmasterace too cherd but the good people at nvidia/amd release nice shiny patches
[2017-04-17 18:21:46 UTC] beaverofpeeps: So, Phil, how did his relationship with that one chick go from a few years ago.
[2017-04-17 18:21:54 UTC] derichloveslemur: @CodenameOne favorite game this year or last year?
[2017-04-17 18:21:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :D new fanart
[2017-04-17 18:21:58 UTC] beaverofpeeps: And what happened to John rambo
[2017-04-17 18:22:09 UTC] darksydephil: enough of that
[2017-04-17 18:22:10 UTC] yacherdy: I know dragin but I get far less crashes with Fallout/Elder Scrolls on PC than I did with console
[2017-04-17 18:22:12 UTC] codenameone: @YaCherdy Maybe with 100 mods that make it play more like the better games(COUGHNewVegas).
[2017-04-17 18:22:16 UTC] yacherdy: New Vegas was crazy with the amount of bugs
[2017-04-17 18:22:17 UTC] darksydephil: obvious troll is obvious
[2017-04-17 18:22:25 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Ready for Day 2 of 8 years on DSPGaming
[2017-04-17 18:22:28 UTC] podusmonens: yeah it's pretty rare cherd
[2017-04-17 18:22:29 UTC] drdevinrx: I thought NV was the best FO game
[2017-04-17 18:22:38 UTC] lioncock: New Vegas was buggy too but i thought the story and setting to be much more interesting to my personal tastes
[2017-04-17 18:22:47 UTC] yacherdy: @Lioncock I can agree on that
[2017-04-17 18:22:51 UTC] yacherdy: FO3 > NV > FO4
[2017-04-17 18:22:52 UTC] codenameone: @DrDevinRX NV IS the best 3D Fallout game. Period. End of story. It's not up for debate; it's a fact.
[2017-04-17 18:22:52 UTC] derichloveslemur: Who's ready for Outlast 2?
[2017-04-17 18:22:54 UTC] yacherdy: for me
[2017-04-17 18:23:02 UTC] yacherdy: @CodenameOne cahman
[2017-04-17 18:23:05 UTC] splitplaythru: Like in Persona 4, phil is wasteful in time needed to increase confidant's ranks. He should always have matching arcana when going out with confidants.
[2017-04-17 18:23:21 UTC] anondublo1: 2streamz PogChamp
[2017-04-17 18:23:22 UTC] drdevinrx: @CodenameOne, Lol, nice and adamant. I like it.
[2017-04-17 18:23:32 UTC] yacherdy: Your fact is WRONG
[2017-04-17 18:23:35 UTC] lvlpower: @darksydephil so are you going to do Dark Souls 2 reception run with stream chat
[2017-04-17 18:23:47 UTC] akioartorius: reception run?
[2017-04-17 18:23:47 UTC] drdevinrx: @SplitPlaythru, He should, but it's his own playthrough, so he can do whatever he feels like.
[2017-04-17 18:23:54 UTC] anondublo1: who the fuck is spreading fake news? mods?
[2017-04-17 18:24:05 UTC] finiteresource: what news
[2017-04-17 18:24:07 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey @anondublo1 @akioartorius and @lvlpower bud!
[2017-04-17 18:24:10 UTC] codenameone: @YaCherdy FO3 can kiss my ass. Not even close to being an RPG. Predetermined character backstory, can only play for one faction, limited characterization through dialogue, poor writing, etc.
[2017-04-17 18:24:10 UTC] yacherdy: fake fax
[2017-04-17 18:24:13 UTC] anondublo1: the fake ones

[2017-04-17 18:24:51 UTC] drdevinrx: IT's up
[2017-04-17 18:24:55 UTC] akioartorius: the voice actor for Igor passed so they had to get a new one
[2017-04-17 18:25:03 UTC] podusmonens: cherd do you think the scorpio can compete with pcs?
[2017-04-17 18:25:13 UTC] derichloveslemur: @akioartorius oh the one who passed away was the one who did P4?
[2017-04-17 18:25:14 UTC] drdevinrx: @podusmonens, I don't know about that

[2017-04-17 19:54:16 UTC] jaxunhero: @darksydephil I seriously believe that the reason for the oddity in the question replies is due to it being lost in translation. Remember sometime Japanese jokes are as simple as having characters have a double meaning and that doesn't usually translate well to English
[2017-04-17 19:54:26 UTC] anondublo1: @areyoushivering MingLee

[2017-04-17 19:58:05 UTC] vince329: Digital Devil Saga is the exception since it is a little more like Final Fantasy in story structure
[2017-04-17 19:58:07 UTC] anondublo1: @TheNewFaceofCreation People in the stream chat are telling me babies can't chew because they don't have teeth. Right, I was just supposed to know that. Kappa

[2017-04-17 19:59:33 UTC] vince329: @Phoenixrising2015 the difference between Persona and the rest of its SMT counterparts is that unlike Persona (3, 4, and 5), there's no time management system. So it's more like a normal JRPG in that regard.
[2017-04-17 19:59:52 UTC] betheboom: roman reigns got his ass beat by braun strowman that was cool

[2017-04-17 20:00:00 UTC] pcgamehunter: 50K about enough for a full gear upgrade for one dungeon. And he needs at least 100K for a link and some items
[2017-04-17 20:00:06 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, You can probably give the Chinese Sweets to Takemi, Makoto, or Kawakami
[2017-04-17 20:00:13 UTC] vince329: but combat and exploration is very much a concurrent formula for every game
[2017-04-17 20:00:14 UTC] fa11enh3ro: Get deep in that

[2017-04-17 20:01:23 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I know Persona 1 and 2 are more like normal JRPGs

[2017-04-17 20:01:32 UTC] vlayer: Just call him Silent Hill
[2017-04-17 20:01:37 UTC] vince329: @dukaduka more like Final Fantasy and Dragon quest with their dungeon crawling aspects
[2017-04-17 20:01:40 UTC] pcgamehunter: I hate when they force you to do something, otherwise the time limit kind of makes you pay attention and plan ahead, I personally enjoy that

[2017-04-17 20:01:49 UTC] acgprofessor: Persona 2 is really good

[2017-04-17 20:38:39 UTC] kovorus: Mookie blaylock
[2017-04-17 20:38:46 UTC] blue_blur64: If you just power up Arsene all of the time, he can actually be a pretty powerful persona
[2017-04-17 20:38:48 UTC] derichloveslemur: Mokoi I think he meant @DarksydePhil

[2017-04-17 20:39:24 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Sudama with inheriting new moves?
[2017-04-17 20:39:26 UTC] vlayer: Treasure Demons when fused with a Persona just creates the higher/lower tier of the same Arcana
[2017-04-17 20:39:29 UTC] blue_blur64: Kushi, you can
[2017-04-17 20:39:33 UTC] akioartorius: mokoi?

[2017-04-17 20:39:51 UTC] kushiyakitori: @blue_blur64, ah cool. thats useful then. Seems like a good persona to get just for the sake of buying it for fusions.
[2017-04-17 20:40:00 UTC] amplifyed: you can, it counts as a persona
[2017-04-17 20:40:02 UTC] marktactics: You can
[2017-04-17 20:40:08 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Makouha, Mafrei, Mapsi, and Media for Sudama maybe?
[2017-04-17 20:40:09 UTC] na_so_bad: You can get the treasure demons out, but it will cost more than a regular persona.
[2017-04-17 20:40:14 UTC] amplifyed: toggle to registered only

[2017-04-17 20:41:07 UTC] derichloveslemur: btw.
[2017-04-17 20:41:19 UTC] blue_blur64: It is, just all treasure personas are more expensive than the counterparts
[2017-04-17 20:41:26 UTC] clesstheangei: regent is the most cost effective treasure persona to get better persona btw
[2017-04-17 20:41:29 UTC] vlayer: This is a reason why money is so valuable in Persona, unlike many other JRPGs
[2017-04-17 20:41:32 UTC] phoenixrising2015: This I also like about Persona
[2017-04-17 20:41:40 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The cross mixing and creating
