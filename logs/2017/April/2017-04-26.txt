[2017-04-26 18:09:57 UTC] howlinthedeep: Phil you are about 70% done with the game. So it should take 2-3 hours to finish. Looking at people whos done the game in 5 hours, you're where they were 3.5 hours into it

[2017-04-26 18:11:57 UTC] alan_is_awake: i hope the game is longer than today's 1st stream
[2017-04-26 18:12:09 UTC] darksydephil: its not a matter of getting stuck
[2017-04-26 18:12:14 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Oh, and for random fact of the day, the first ever 100% speedrun of Zelda BotW took 49 hours
[2017-04-26 18:12:20 UTC] darksydephil: even getting stuck, ive only extended the length of my playthrough by maybe an hour
[2017-04-26 18:12:28 UTC] lutzthewise: how come I can never see the stream and no one in this chat ever says hi??
[2017-04-26 18:12:28 UTC] darksydephil: the point is, it takes time to solve puzzles, explore, and read the lore

[2017-04-26 18:13:05 UTC] darksydephil: if you're playing a survival horror game and purposely skipping all the logs that tell the story, you're playing it very wrong
[2017-04-26 18:13:06 UTC] alan_is_awake: HELLo
[2017-04-26 18:13:06 UTC] sjd_128: hows it going phil and chat <3
[2017-04-26 18:13:09 UTC] jwalker70: I was just saying you can beat the game faster without rushing through it
[2017-04-26 18:13:21 UTC] crazycubedude: True phil, very true.
[2017-04-26 18:13:27 UTC] goldencolts: VERY cool
[2017-04-26 18:13:32 UTC] jwalker70: When I play games I HATE reading logs
[2017-04-26 18:13:39 UTC] zachty200: hey
[2017-04-26 18:13:40 UTC] humpiershaggy: I love Outlast 2's story over the first. It's alot more sinister and dark.
[2017-04-26 18:13:48 UTC] jwalker70: Doesn't mean I'm playing it wrong
[2017-04-26 18:14:01 UTC] howlinthedeep: Yeah survivor horror games are more about the experience than anything else
[2017-04-26 18:14:19 UTC] crazycubedude: I say it's true unless you already know the story and have played it before and just want to try and speedrun it for fun.
[2017-04-26 18:14:21 UTC] darksydephil: well the first game's story was a lot more simple but also kind of just thrown at you. 95% of the story was mistreatment/experimentation on patients, then all of a sudden the last hour is like GHOSTS!!!
[2017-04-26 18:14:23 UTC] thepastryarchy: I wouldn't say "playing it wrong", but maybe "not doing it proper justice" would be a better way to put it. The beauty of gaming is that you can play however you like ;)

[2017-04-26 18:15:07 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Apparently the MC from Outlast is dead and the Wallrider is still in containment according to Twitter
[2017-04-26 18:15:12 UTC] alan_is_awake: alaaaan alan wake
[2017-04-26 18:15:14 UTC] darksydephil: this game so far, its very tough to figure out what's going on. its not coherent since you have two plotlines going on: the christians/heretics and then the school/suicide one from the past
[2017-04-26 18:15:17 UTC] sjd_128: the developers intention is to get you involved with the psychological horror and substance of the lore, i think if you are rushing through survival horror games you are missing the point entirely
[2017-04-26 18:15:22 UTC] phoenixrising2015: If anything I'm going to play dead souls
[2017-04-26 18:15:24 UTC] crazycubedude: Merch is showing for me lutz
[2017-04-26 18:15:30 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Of course the MC is dead in Outlast

[2017-04-26 18:15:57 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The MC was pretty much not the MC anymore
[2017-04-26 18:16:02 UTC] sir_bedivere: dsp it helps to actually pay attention to the game, you might be able to understand any game you play then
[2017-04-26 18:16:13 UTC] darksydephil: yeah didnt the protagonist of Outlast get possessed by the Wallrider at the end?
[2017-04-26 18:16:25 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I mean he was but he wasn't himself
[2017-04-26 18:16:37 UTC] lutzthewise: @darksydephil hopefully I get to see you stream this time. I've seen you get alot of hate on yt and most of it seems a bit overkill.
[2017-04-26 18:16:39 UTC] coralguy: Hey phil
[2017-04-26 18:16:40 UTC] thepastryarchy: Yep, then shot to pieces
[2017-04-26 18:17:00 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @DarksydePhil he was possessed until he was Neutralize. Pretty much they took back Wallrider

[2017-04-26 20:27:04 UTC] thepastryarchy: This game is kinda like an over-enthusiastic haunted house owner, where he keeps shouting in your face to run to the next specific room so he can abuse the hell out of a violin and make a bunch of growling noises before shouting you off to the next room again. If you're not fast enough, you get thrown out.
