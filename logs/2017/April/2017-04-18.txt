[2017-04-18 02:09:22 UTC] yacherdy: Why does hip hop suck in 1996?

[2017-04-18 02:10:14 UTC] lioncock: Skate was nice because it was around when Tony Hawk games became garbage
[2017-04-18 02:10:23 UTC] lioncock: and we were still able to play a good skateboarding game
[2017-04-18 02:10:35 UTC] beaverofpeeps: I never played tony hawk when it was good

[2017-04-18 02:19:42 UTC] hapticbabyman: @akioartorius xenogears would be too difficult; it's on the more challenging side and he'd be using a guide
[2017-04-18 02:20:17 UTC] akioartorius: seiken densetsu or Secret of Mana

[2017-04-18 18:14:25 UTC] darksydephil: dr zombius made a new animation for subs, but its a generic one (not game specific) so we wont' see it today
[2017-04-18 18:14:57 UTC] darksydephil: ok stream is going live
[2017-04-18 18:15:02 UTC] yacherdy: I'm an ignorant American who doesn't understand the differences between English/Scottish/Irish dialect.

[2017-04-18 18:21:35 UTC] the_fear_of_a_wet_fart: what time is it PDT?
[2017-04-18 18:21:39 UTC] kinggoken: anyone think persona 5 is a little to easy?

[2017-04-18 18:22:03 UTC] the_fear_of_a_wet_fart: bethebaby so the stream time advertised isn't when the gameplay starts? (this is my first time here)
[2017-04-18 18:22:11 UTC] blue_blur64: He's not hitting the deadline today LUL

[2017-04-18 18:22:24 UTC] bethebaby: @the_fear_of_a_wet_fart Correct. Gameplay usually starts an hour after the scheduled time.
[2017-04-18 18:22:24 UTC] kinggoken: he said he was getting something to drink
[2017-04-18 18:22:31 UTC] the_fear_of_a_wet_fart: wow that's odd
[2017-04-18 18:22:35 UTC] yacherdy: He starts gameplay at 12:00 PM usally
[2017-04-18 18:22:43 UTC] jaxunhero: @yacherdy hey
[2017-04-18 18:22:43 UTC] blue_blur64: It gives people time to show up so they don't miss gameplay
[2017-04-18 18:22:44 UTC] yacherdy: 11:45 if it's a short pre stream
[2017-04-18 18:22:45 UTC] bobbi_ling: aka noon

[2017-04-18 21:19:35 UTC] phoenixrising2015: For those who haven't seen it, it skips the opening prologue and starts right after with Ishi, and the entire concept is Duke Nukem knows this is not his game, and is like "I have no idea whats going on here" but just goes alone with it anyway
[2017-04-18 21:19:48 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Braun Strowman still is awesome

[2017-04-18 21:21:38 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015 So when do you think they will have this titleshot cause orton's defending at Payback
[2017-04-18 21:21:44 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Probably Harper or Sami but probably Harper since hes still riding the Bray as a main even coattails

[2017-04-18 21:23:00 UTC] derichloveslemur: dspDeath vs Kappa
[2017-04-18 21:23:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and Harper is essentially his right hand man so they are probably going to be giving him the rub from it
[2017-04-18 21:23:08 UTC] derichloveslemur: yeah good point.

[2017-04-18 22:18:11 UTC] pcgamehunter: @stuart360 I heard it was really good, like nearing Tales from the Borderlands level, just different universe.

[2017-04-18 22:22:14 UTC] conky89: I never liked that in games like this
[2017-04-18 22:22:22 UTC] vlayer: The problem was that he mashed X too fast, which screwed up the ambush
[2017-04-18 22:22:25 UTC] stuart360: Vince i actually thought it would be harder on normal, thjats what everyone was saying
[2017-04-18 22:22:27 UTC] betheboom: i love guardians movie and comics it is hilarious in a heroes seem stupid but cn actually beat the bad guys kinda way :D
[2017-04-18 22:22:29 UTC] bobbi_ling: plays guitar solo*
[2017-04-18 22:22:34 UTC] pcgamehunter: I think Phil's slightly bellow average level is catching up to him
[2017-04-18 22:22:39 UTC] sonicwe: conky89 thats been in rpgs since the dawn of rpgs
[2017-04-18 22:22:41 UTC] vendatus: but it's in every game
[2017-04-18 22:22:53 UTC] conky89: Not all of them
[2017-04-18 22:22:59 UTC] finiteresource: viking are you planning on being top cheer tonight?
[2017-04-18 22:23:02 UTC] punishedmac: Below average level? That's what happens when you hold up every group for money and lose out on experience.
[2017-04-18 22:23:04 UTC] sonicwe: only action rpgs stop doing it
[2017-04-18 22:23:08 UTC] vince329: @stuart360 I get what you mean. Though easier than most Atlus games, this game still has its fair share of SMT moments
[2017-04-18 22:23:11 UTC] betheboom: spiderman is like that he goes in all cocky and sure he will win gets his but whooped then somehow wins anyway
[2017-04-18 22:23:23 UTC] darthvidarviking: for sure @finiteresource
[2017-04-18 22:23:33 UTC] finiteresource: ok man
[2017-04-18 22:23:34 UTC] bobbi_ling: spidey is bae, what more can i say?
[2017-04-18 22:23:43 UTC] stuart360: I was just hoping for more Phil rage and fails vince lol
[2017-04-18 22:23:47 UTC] pcgamehunter: @Conky89 Yeah, but they use it as a game mechanic, the enemies tend to target your allies first and they always give your party members the abilty to take the damage for the MC.
[2017-04-18 22:23:48 UTC] easton_taylor1: Is Phil close to the boss?
[2017-04-18 22:23:49 UTC] doctorzzz: by now he should have plenty sp restore items to give joker enough
[2017-04-18 22:24:02 UTC] betheboom: bobbi but he does get his ass kicked before winning like ALL heroes super or not
[2017-04-18 22:24:06 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's like a extra layer of challenge, even if it makes no sense
[2017-04-18 22:24:08 UTC] conky89: Ah so that lessens it then
[2017-04-18 22:24:29 UTC] yacherdy: I want to touch Spidey's webbing.
[2017-04-18 22:24:33 UTC] yacherdy: weebing
[2017-04-18 22:24:34 UTC] stuart360: Spiderman is no Steven Seagal, thats for sure
[2017-04-18 22:24:34 UTC] pcgamehunter: Kind of like running away with your allies unconcious it's like *Jokers runs* "Zoop" *friends magically return*
[2017-04-18 22:24:36 UTC] bobbi_ling: me too
[2017-04-18 22:24:46 UTC] amplifyed: even though the core smt games are generally tougher than persona and those games the MC can die while the party is still alive
[2017-04-18 22:24:49 UTC] mizzle1987: @darthvidarviking looks like you gonna be the cheer king today :)
[2017-04-18 22:24:53 UTC] amplifyed: it is the one constant difference
[2017-04-18 22:25:01 UTC] conky89: It just feels kind of dumb when there are ways of reviving your party members but not the main one
[2017-04-18 22:25:01 UTC] bobbi_ling: spidey hentai with venom slime

[2017-04-18 22:25:33 UTC] vlayer: The MC is overpowered, so it's a balance to make him more valuable/vulnerable
[2017-04-18 22:25:35 UTC] betheboom: bobbi which spidey is better amazing spider-man, new spider-man or the first one (toby maguire)
[2017-04-18 22:25:37 UTC] pcgamehunter: Truth is darth ddos'd deep Kappa
[2017-04-18 22:25:53 UTC] conky89: Yeah cause the MC can use multiple persona's
