[2017-04-10 07:49:05 UTC] lightsidephillip: Hi Phil, huge fan. Recently I had a friend blocked from you in the social medias. He found the era of his ways, and he was wondering what he could do to be unblocked?
[2017-04-10 07:50:54 UTC] darthvidarviking: lightside philip lol
[2017-04-10 07:55:25 UTC] lightsidephillip: But please, my friend watched your vids since 2008 and when he typed insulting comments, he didn't know. He has a hard time understanding emotions and wants to apologize for what he did.
[2017-04-10 07:55:40 UTC] darthvidarviking: sounds weird
[2017-04-10 07:56:01 UTC] darthvidarviking: but send him a e-mail and explain the situation And If it makes sense I am sure he sill understand
[2017-04-10 07:56:27 UTC] lightsidephillip: Okay, where can I contact him?
[2017-04-10 07:56:44 UTC] darthvidarviking: darksydephil@hotmail.com

[2017-04-10 17:37:22 UTC] blue_blur64: I had it updated a few minutes ago
[2017-04-10 17:41:02 UTC] betheboom: booooooooooo
[2017-04-10 17:41:12 UTC] betheboom: I WANT MASS EFFECT
[2017-04-10 17:41:51 UTC] betheboom: before anyone says i should've voted, i did
[2017-04-10 17:42:11 UTC] blue_blur64: too bad bethe. Btw I've just now maxed out my 3rd confidant and I'm at the end of August
[2017-04-10 17:42:20 UTC] errnoent: bethe what is it about mass effect that you like so much?
[2017-04-10 17:42:53 UTC] errnoent: I genuinely can't find anything about it that's enjoyable. It's almost as bad as the new pepsi commercial
[2017-04-10 17:43:04 UTC] betheboom: i find persona boring and i like mass effect, simple as that
[2017-04-10 17:43:14 UTC] blue_blur64: just andromeda @errnoent , or the entire series?
[2017-04-10 17:43:18 UTC] errnoent: andromeda
[2017-04-10 17:43:36 UTC] betheboom: i like the characters and the story
[2017-04-10 17:43:43 UTC] betheboom: of andromeda
[2017-04-10 17:43:45 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm honestly easy to please, so I'd probably enjoy andromeda myself
[2017-04-10 17:43:50 UTC] errnoent: Hm.. That's probably my least favorite part
[2017-04-10 17:44:02 UTC] betheboom: im with silent on the easy to please
[2017-04-10 17:44:22 UTC] betheboom: persona dont please me though
[2017-04-10 17:44:34 UTC] betheboom: it makes me so bored i get cranky
[2017-04-10 17:44:36 UTC] blue_blur64: I can actually give a good example of this. Sonic and the Secret Rings. A lot of people hate that game so much, saying it's worse than 06
[2017-04-10 17:44:46 UTC] errnoent: lol, that's what happens to me with zelder and andromeda
[2017-04-10 17:44:48 UTC] blue_blur64: But I honestly enjoy it despite the control issues

[2017-04-10 17:56:13 UTC] errnoent: Yeah, congrats Phil. I proposed a couple of months ago as well, gotta say it's everything that comes afterward that's really stressful
[2017-04-10 17:56:16 UTC] darksydephil: Welp we've dropped to 239 subs, hopefully this means a lot of people are going to resub soon
[2017-04-10 17:56:32 UTC] ratchefan12: @DarksydePhil i remember the video where you first introducded Leanna now things have come full cicle and you guys engaged congrats man I couldn't be happier for you
[2017-04-10 17:56:34 UTC] howlinthedeep: Hi Phil
[2017-04-10 17:56:36 UTC] howlinthedeep: congrats
[2017-04-10 17:56:39 UTC] darksydephil: well errnoent nothing is really going to change here, due to finances etc we're in no position to plan a wedding now
[2017-04-10 17:56:48 UTC] howlinthedeep: good ratchefan12
[2017-04-10 17:57:15 UTC] ratchefan12: @HowlintheDeep Glad to hear it man
[2017-04-10 17:57:44 UTC] darksydephil: LOL Youtube ad revenue is a mess now
[2017-04-10 17:57:55 UTC] ratchefan12: so does phil lose the emote he earned for 250csubs?
[2017-04-10 17:57:58 UTC] darksydephil: so on saturday my views shot up, not surprising right? it was the weekend and people got caught up on persona and otehr stuff
[2017-04-10 17:58:03 UTC] howlinthedeep: Did you propose to her at home Phil?
[2017-04-10 17:58:08 UTC] darksydephil: well ad revenue went DOWN
[2017-04-10 17:58:13 UTC] lunaequalsluna: some people have dropped by 99%
[2017-04-10 17:58:18 UTC] lunaequalsluna: no joke
[2017-04-10 17:58:19 UTC] darksydephil: which means because more people watched there weren't enough ads to go around
[2017-04-10 17:58:23 UTC] blue_blur64: 99% O_o
[2017-04-10 17:58:29 UTC] darksydephil: youtube is a joke now
[2017-04-10 17:58:34 UTC] howlinthedeep: no ratchefan12
[2017-04-10 17:58:34 UTC] ratchefan12: Fuck youtube
[2017-04-10 17:58:43 UTC] blue_blur64: that's pretty bad
[2017-04-10 17:58:52 UTC] lunaequalsluna: a few political channels, went from like $100s per day, down to less than a dollar
[2017-04-10 17:59:06 UTC] ratchefan12: @DarksydePhil im glad you came to twitch again when you did phil
[2017-04-10 17:59:11 UTC] ufccurbstomp: gotta censor those political opinions
[2017-04-10 17:59:12 UTC] blue_blur64: Well rip that political channel idea then Kappa
[2017-04-10 17:59:27 UTC] lunaequalsluna: funny how when phil first mentioned everyone was shitting on him saying nothing is wrong with youtube,
[2017-04-10 17:59:33 UTC] lunaequalsluna: now look lol :D
[2017-04-10 17:59:34 UTC] howlinthedeep: gotta make that a twitch stream then silent Kappa

[2017-04-10 18:01:44 UTC] ratchefan12: just now
[2017-04-10 18:02:05 UTC] errnoent: I'm just jerkin' ball chains man

[2017-04-10 18:02:13 UTC] ratchefan12: lol agreed
[2017-04-10 18:02:22 UTC] howlinthedeep: i agree bobbi
[2017-04-10 18:02:48 UTC] howlinthedeep: I voted for persona 5...too bad Phil can only play another couple streams of it
[2017-04-10 18:03:03 UTC] lunaequalsluna: i want him to do persona 5 because the sooner he finishes persona 5 the sooner he restarts danganrompa
[2017-04-10 18:03:14 UTC] bobbi_ling: i see lord phillip got engaged
[2017-04-10 18:03:21 UTC] ratchefan12: I dont know why people vote for it when phil cant play past 7/7 stupid japenese copyright bullshit
[2017-04-10 18:03:25 UTC] blue_blur64: deep, I honestly don't think the copyright rules Atlus set are being help up anyway
[2017-04-10 18:03:32 UTC] blue_blur64: *held
[2017-04-10 18:03:45 UTC] ratchefan12: what do you mean blur
[2017-04-10 18:03:53 UTC] howlinthedeep: Yeah I've seen youtube videos of people playing past 7/7
[2017-04-10 18:03:54 UTC] errnoent: Is the video of Phil introducing Leanna still up?
[2017-04-10 18:03:55 UTC] podusmonens: RingGate is over
[2017-04-10 18:04:01 UTC] howlinthedeep: They don't seem to be shut down
[2017-04-10 18:04:07 UTC] blue_blur64: Just watching the last 3 of Phil's Persona 5 videos today, I saw videos that said for example "Persona 5: Boss Fight #10"
[2017-04-10 18:04:09 UTC] podusmonens: the real ring claimed the throne
[2017-04-10 18:04:21 UTC] ufccurbstomp: I don't know why Atlus is even TRYING to censor it. I mean christ, Boss Battle Database has all the fights up on Youtube
[2017-04-10 18:04:23 UTC] bobbi_ling: lol
[2017-04-10 18:04:28 UTC] thekingofsimpletonshd: doods

[2017-04-10 18:04:41 UTC] blue_blur64: So I'm pretty sure nobody is doing anything about it
[2017-04-10 18:04:46 UTC] podusmonens: why bobbi?
[2017-04-10 18:04:52 UTC] ratchefan12: @HowlintheDeep phil isnt gonna take the chance of copyright strikes though
[2017-04-10 18:05:13 UTC] blue_blur64: stomp, that might've been one of the videos I saw on the side
[2017-04-10 18:05:27 UTC] errnoent: hello jimbob

[2017-04-10 18:06:07 UTC] darksydephil: whats hilarious is i blatantly explain everything about the engagement in that video, but a ton of idiots will ignore the video and still make shit up
[2017-04-10 18:06:08 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh, the last P5 video was funny with what somebody said
[2017-04-10 18:06:25 UTC] ratchefan12: @DarksydePhil sigh gotta hate trolls right phil sorry you deal with this shit
[2017-04-10 18:06:40 UTC] blue_blur64: They said that it was a perfect example of how bad you are at games because you didn't use L1 to look up weaknesses on enemies you never fought before Kappa
[2017-04-10 18:06:41 UTC] podusmonens: Phil, why do you even make that sort of thing public, if you don't mind me asking?
[2017-04-10 18:06:51 UTC] bobbi_ling: engagement trolls? poor soks
[2017-04-10 18:06:57 UTC] soulrider95: DarksydePhil, btw the final boss of this palace is on ATLUS's banned list
[2017-04-10 18:07:12 UTC] darksydephil: nobody cares, lol
[2017-04-10 18:07:17 UTC] darksydephil: everyone has already streamed/uploaded this boss
[2017-04-10 18:07:22 UTC] darksydephil: and nobody had anything done to them
[2017-04-10 18:07:26 UTC] blue_blur64: soulrider, there's a channel that has all P5 bosses up, and nothing has happened to them
[2017-04-10 18:07:43 UTC] soulrider95: I'm just saying it's on their guidelines as a warning
[2017-04-10 18:07:43 UTC] ratchefan12: Atlus can go suck a dick
[2017-04-10 18:07:45 UTC] darksydephil: ive had people spamming atlus's twitter account with every video fo P5 ive uploaded so far telling them to take me down
[2017-04-10 18:07:51 UTC] bobbi_ling: dont get a copyright strike phil :(
[2017-04-10 18:07:52 UTC] blue_blur64: LUL
[2017-04-10 18:07:54 UTC] darksydephil: thats not even an exaggeration mind you

[2017-04-10 18:08:13 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I checked Phil's RedDeadDSP channel and someone just took over it

[2017-04-10 18:08:33 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I know
[2017-04-10 18:08:33 UTC] akioartorius: Congrats Phil. Random question: how did you propose? just curious for some reason
[2017-04-10 18:08:52 UTC] podusmonens: why do you even care
[2017-04-10 18:09:03 UTC] 0megaj0ker: just curious
[2017-04-10 18:09:04 UTC] podusmonens: why does nayone care

[2017-04-10 18:09:09 UTC] podusmonens: anyone*
[2017-04-10 18:09:12 UTC] howlinthedeep: i was wondering that too akio I don'ot think he said how he proposed in the wip
[2017-04-10 18:09:14 UTC] akioartorius: Thats why I said it was random
[2017-04-10 18:09:18 UTC] ornightz: seriously that's harsh you haven't even strimed passed 7/7 and they doin that :/
[2017-04-10 18:09:42 UTC] howlinthedeep: the way he said it it sounded like he just did it at home or something like that
[2017-04-10 18:09:45 UTC] blue_blur64: ornight, they do whatever they can to shut Phil down, you should expect it at this point
[2017-04-10 18:09:55 UTC] darksydephil: i proposed like every normal human: we mutually agreed to get married ages ago, looked at rings together, i picke done and told her id gotten it, we were waiting to take a trip for me to propose and it didnt happen so i just gave her the ring instead of waiting. you know, REALITY, unlike the overdramatic, unrealistic bullshit you see in movies and on tv
[2017-04-10 18:10:04 UTC] podusmonens: people get engaged all the time, it doesn't have to be this grandiose, romantic shit
[2017-04-10 18:10:13 UTC] codenameone: @blue_blur64 They're not doing it just to target Phil, come on.
[2017-04-10 18:10:16 UTC] podusmonens: too many romcoms for you, lads
[2017-04-10 18:10:24 UTC] lioncock: you should have done it john cena style fam
[2017-04-10 18:10:27 UTC] errnoent: I proposed when we were in the car about to go eat
[2017-04-10 18:10:32 UTC] cherry_dood: lol. how romantic.
[2017-04-10 18:10:34 UTC] thekingofsimpletonshd: #pushcena
[2017-04-10 18:10:47 UTC] blue_blur64: codename, they easily are
[2017-04-10 18:10:56 UTC] bobbi_ling: are you engaged dragin?
[2017-04-10 18:10:58 UTC] errnoent: Not everyone has to do cheesy shit like John Cena or those dopes that propose at basketball games
[2017-04-10 18:11:00 UTC] cherry_dood: I did a speech and then took her to a surprise dinner.
[2017-04-10 18:11:15 UTC] edicus: Hey Phil, congrats brah
[2017-04-10 18:11:17 UTC] darksydephil: the john cena proposal was fake, you know
[2017-04-10 18:11:22 UTC] darksydephil: they'd been engaged for a while already
[2017-04-10 18:11:24 UTC] lioncock: i know i was trying to be funny
[2017-04-10 18:11:28 UTC] podusmonens: nope bobbi, and not planning to either
[2017-04-10 18:11:33 UTC] codenameone: @blue_blur64 I significantly doubt Atlus would pick on one streamer. That's nuts.
[2017-04-10 18:11:39 UTC] blue_blur64: No codename
[2017-04-10 18:11:46 UTC] jaxunhero: Grats Phil!
[2017-04-10 18:11:50 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm talking about the people tweeting Atlus all of Phil's videos
[2017-04-10 18:11:50 UTC] edicus: Something in wrestling was staged!? WutFace
[2017-04-10 18:11:54 UTC] mustudonter: Is this a JOJO reference ? Keepo
[2017-04-10 18:11:59 UTC] kinglouis119: Howdy
[2017-04-10 18:12:06 UTC] howlinthedeep: well most people i know have "overdramatic proposals" so it's not too uncommon...but it's cool if you don't do that too

[2017-04-10 18:12:51 UTC] lioncock: if so DSP putting his neck out there like a daredevil
[2017-04-10 18:12:52 UTC] errnoent: I really don't understand what the appeal is to those sort of proposals. Does it somehow make it more romantic if 1000s of people are watching?
[2017-04-10 18:12:52 UTC] blue_blur64: But there was also things like Ryuji's awakening that I heard wasn't allowed either

[2017-04-10 18:12:55 UTC] darksydephil: i hate to say this, but overdramatic proposals and expensive rings are totally for suckers. Leanna purposely told me she didnt want an expensive ring because they're so cliche and literally worthless, not worth the insane amount of money put into it
[2017-04-10 18:12:57 UTC] blue_blur64: And Phil's still fine

[2017-04-10 20:25:37 UTC] vlayer: Mishima is the Phantom Thieves fanboy

[2017-04-10 20:26:05 UTC] pcgamehunter: "Why is this so long!??"
[2017-04-10 20:26:06 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Just to let ya know before you send the calling card you gotta make sure you explored it thoroughly and opened all the special locked chests.
[2017-04-10 20:26:10 UTC] yacherdy: 25 dollars for III is decent...lots of content even though a lot of is padding
[2017-04-10 20:26:18 UTC] kushiyakitori: @pcgamehunter, will a person be underleveled/too weak if they don't go into mementos? or is it something else?
[2017-04-10 20:26:19 UTC] yacherdy: I still enjoyed the cutscenes and story that I watched
[2017-04-10 20:26:21 UTC] masternutella: Padding?
[2017-04-10 20:26:23 UTC] yacherdy: good music
[2017-04-10 20:26:29 UTC] blue_blur64: Kushi, in a way yes
[2017-04-10 20:26:31 UTC] yacherdy: yes the side stuff @MasterNutella
[2017-04-10 20:26:32 UTC] pcgamehunter: @KushiYakitori That and other reasons
[2017-04-10 20:26:37 UTC] betheboom: bobbi you better buy it and play it
[2017-04-10 20:26:38 UTC] podusmonens: *burpz
[2017-04-10 20:26:38 UTC] masternutella: Ah that type of game
[2017-04-10 20:26:42 UTC] bobbi_ling: padding aka filler?
[2017-04-10 20:26:46 UTC] yacherdy: yes
[2017-04-10 20:26:51 UTC] bobbi_ling: ew
[2017-04-10 20:26:53 UTC] blue_blur64: Basically, you have to do mementos requests in order to raise mishima's confidant rank
[2017-04-10 20:26:54 UTC] yacherdy: WutFace
[2017-04-10 20:26:56 UTC] masternutella: I'll probably do it all lol
[2017-04-10 20:27:02 UTC] kushiyakitori: @blue_blur64, @pcgamehunter Hmm. Thanks. Guess when I start my run I should try to go in pretty often then.
[2017-04-10 20:27:03 UTC] yacherdy: well me too @MasterNutella
[2017-04-10 20:27:05 UTC] yacherdy: :DS

[2017-04-10 20:27:21 UTC] blue_blur64: And raising that rank increases not only the experience you gain from battle, but your backup members will gain experience as well
[2017-04-10 20:27:25 UTC] kushiyakitori: @blue_blur64, does mishima have a good confidant ability or does it stop the story if you don't have it?
[2017-04-10 20:27:27 UTC] vendatus: Every game has filler MingLee

[2017-04-10 20:27:37 UTC] yacherdy: @Vendatus that's probably true
[2017-04-10 20:27:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: sorry Bobbi :(
[2017-04-10 20:27:44 UTC] pcgamehunter: I recommend doing you best to just force grind in one go, it's not worth spending time you can level up links in mementos or dungeons in general
[2017-04-10 20:27:48 UTC] betheboom: lol jimbob
[2017-04-10 20:27:49 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, If you haven't opened all special locked chests and explored it thoroughly don't send the calling card.

[2017-04-10 20:28:21 UTC] vendatus: ⚽ VoHiYo
[2017-04-10 20:28:24 UTC] pcgamehunter: Then again I fucking couldn't find Haru, so I blame her for that one lol

[2017-04-10 20:29:24 UTC] pcgamehunter: In NG+ when everythings maxed it's much easier, since you cut like 1/4 of the gameplay
[2017-04-10 20:29:31 UTC] vlayer: You can make lockpicks the night you send the calling card

[2017-04-10 20:30:10 UTC] pcgamehunter: @KushiYakitori Try to just grind alot in mementos in one day, then one day run the whole dungeon and beat the boss the next day, basically spend as few days in dungeons, but do a lot in one go
