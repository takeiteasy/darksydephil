[2017-04-21 18:03:22 UTC] blue_blur64: Can I just say that God's Hand's animation in this game is basically an out of control rocket? :P

[2017-04-21 18:04:03 UTC] popsicolo: I did the reaper exploit and overleveled a little bit.
[2017-04-21 18:04:12 UTC] popsicolo: Only a little though.
[2017-04-21 18:04:13 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm literally at the final boss's doorstep :P
[2017-04-21 18:04:33 UTC] blue_blur64: Just gotta kill this last asshole

[2017-04-21 18:05:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: like father like son
[2017-04-21 18:05:44 UTC] popsicolo: I maxed out the twins and got Mara early. He made it so the boss you fight before the palace owner on the ship couldn't even hurt me LUL
[2017-04-21 18:06:05 UTC] jwalker70: So who thinks I can finish my last assignment and watch the stream?

[2017-04-21 18:10:59 UTC] jwalker70: Hey Phil
[2017-04-21 18:11:02 UTC] ornightz: Hi
[2017-04-21 18:11:03 UTC] splitplaythru: I maxed out all confidants on first run, luckily. Phew
[2017-04-21 18:11:09 UTC] ufccurbstomp: sup all
[2017-04-21 18:11:12 UTC] blue_blur64: nice work
[2017-04-21 18:11:14 UTC] jwalker70: I'll be working on the KOCC soon
[2017-04-21 18:11:28 UTC] blue_blur64: Honestly I just focused on getting my stats maxed out for party members
[2017-04-21 18:11:36 UTC] blue_blur64: their confidant ranks I mean
[2017-04-21 18:11:56 UTC] blue_blur64: And there was also the trophies I was trying to get
[2017-04-21 18:12:03 UTC] soulrider95: Phil I watched AtK last night, I have to disagree with you on the Vita. iPhone gaming is TRASH compared to Vita/3DS games
[2017-04-21 18:12:07 UTC] splitplaythru: I have one more dungeon left to go after seventh one, I think
[2017-04-21 18:12:14 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @jwalker70 is the montage just going to be Phil failing to recruit monsters? :P
[2017-04-21 18:12:29 UTC] blue_blur64: Did you also just take the final exams?
[2017-04-21 18:12:35 UTC] jwalker70: it's RE so not likely.
[2017-04-21 18:13:09 UTC] popsicolo: Yep. I'm on 12/22
[2017-04-21 18:13:12 UTC] splitplaythru: Hmmm, I think I'm close to those, blue blur.
[2017-04-21 18:13:31 UTC] blue_blur64: Well what date are you currently on split?
[2017-04-21 18:13:31 UTC] jwalker70: Shit really picks up in September.
[2017-04-21 18:13:33 UTC] darksydephil: i never said that mobile gaming is better than 3ds/vita. i said that its more dominant and the way the market is heading. people in general don't care about the quality of mobile games, just that they're accessible and free
[2017-04-21 18:13:57 UTC] soulrider95: They're "Free" until you hit a paywall
[2017-04-21 18:14:01 UTC] applethiefx: Ya, but the moment someone makes good enough attachable paddles for the Iphone (like the switch has) then it's rip for Vita and DS lol
[2017-04-21 18:14:17 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Shame that Persona 5 is going to put on hold till Atlus lifts the restrictions :(
[2017-04-21 18:14:17 UTC] goldencolts: its easier to get someone to spend 50$ on microtransactions for a shitty mobile game than 50$ on a quality standalone game
[2017-04-21 18:14:19 UTC] soulrider95: You can hook up a ps4 controller to android
[2017-04-21 18:14:24 UTC] darksydephil: that's correct. that doesn't make them less popular. they're far more popular than "real" games on 3ds and vita now
[2017-04-21 18:14:29 UTC] bethebaby: It's been RIP for Vita for a couple years now. Sony dropped the ball big time on that one.
[2017-04-21 18:14:35 UTC] splitplaythru: 30th Nov, Blue
[2017-04-21 18:14:37 UTC] soulrider95: Vita still gets a lot of good JRPG's
[2017-04-21 18:14:40 UTC] goldencolts: consumer logic BabyRage BabyRage
[2017-04-21 18:14:46 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh, you got time then LUL
[2017-04-21 18:14:49 UTC] ufccurbstomp: The Vita was amazing hardware that sadly had to compete with a Nintendo handheld
[2017-04-21 18:15:12 UTC] soulrider95: Has the best version of Persona 4 with the true ending
[2017-04-21 18:15:13 UTC] ufccurbstomp: It's hard to fight against a Pokemon machine
[2017-04-21 18:15:51 UTC] ornightz: Also ratchet & clank is very fun , the recent one however I can agree but the early entries are fc'kn classic
[2017-04-21 18:16:00 UTC] popsicolo: I bought the Vita TV when I was on sale for $20. I paid for for the game than I did for the console TriHard
[2017-04-21 18:16:02 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Persona 4 Golden really added more stuff compared to the original
[2017-04-21 18:16:13 UTC] akioartorius: new cutscenes etc
[2017-04-21 18:16:18 UTC] soulrider95: and the Golden Ending
[2017-04-21 18:16:33 UTC] darksydephil: hopefully we get a good turnout since this is the "final" stream for a while
[2017-04-21 18:16:34 UTC] soulrider95: new social links, more dungeons, etc.
[2017-04-21 18:16:37 UTC] akioartorius: which takes place after arena
[2017-04-21 18:16:46 UTC] bethebaby: I bought the Uncharted game for Vita when I bought the system... Haven't played on single minute of it, over a year later.
[2017-04-21 18:17:07 UTC] twitchnotify: 1 viewer resubscribed while you were away!
[2017-04-21 18:17:12 UTC] sensoji: I've seen plenty of steamers go past 7/7 just don't upload the videos to YT for a while.
[2017-04-21 18:17:25 UTC] goldencolts: lol this again ^
[2017-04-21 18:17:34 UTC] ornightz: As a Vita owner myself it's disappointing Sony stopped supporting it
[2017-04-21 18:17:40 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Wouldn't mind a Red Dead Replay during the Summer, a nice warm up until the sequel :D
[2017-04-21 18:17:46 UTC] soulrider95: Still quite a bit of 3rd party support
[2017-04-21 18:17:49 UTC] darksydephil: that's right, risk my livelihood. sounds like a great idea lol
[2017-04-21 18:17:51 UTC] soulrider95: out of Japan
[2017-04-21 18:17:53 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @Ornightz disappointing sure, but understandable
[2017-04-21 18:18:19 UTC] ornightz: Now it's used as a paperweight :(
[2017-04-21 18:18:23 UTC] sanguinenite: Honestly, I would stream past 7/7 and then if Atlus was dumb enough to try to copyright claim me, I would make a huge vlog video and get views. I mean, twitch is now more profitable than youtube right, so who cares?
[2017-04-21 18:18:29 UTC] goldencolts: stream is on if anybody else didnt notice
[2017-04-21 18:19:02 UTC] ornightz: No only Phil can't go beyond 7/7 , everyone else is fine .. just Phil
[2017-04-21 18:19:08 UTC] blue_blur64: sanguine, it's not copyright claim, it stream shutdown
[2017-04-21 18:19:22 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @sanguinenite pretty sure his vlog views won't compensate for the risk of losing his twitch account
[2017-04-21 18:19:38 UTC] kushiyakitori: !schedule
[2017-04-21 18:19:41 UTC] sanguinenite: Large Twitch streamers are waayyy past 7/7 right?
[2017-04-21 18:19:41 UTC] bethebaby: Atlus has apparently shut down at least one streamer for breaking the embargo.
[2017-04-21 18:19:42 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I'm planning on getting Bayonetta soon before the 25th of April
[2017-04-21 18:19:47 UTC] 0megaj0ker: on Steam
[2017-04-21 18:19:57 UTC] cherry_dood: This isn't that big of a deal
[2017-04-21 18:20:11 UTC] goldencolts: if you go .1 seconds past 7/7 atlus will literally bomb your house
[2017-04-21 18:20:15 UTC] vendatus: he wouldn't lose his twitch account NotLikeThis
[2017-04-21 18:20:16 UTC] ornightz: That streamer is most likely trolled on a daily basis then
[2017-04-21 18:20:36 UTC] liesuponlies: You guys see Twitch is rolling out Bits for non-partnered channels now
[2017-04-21 18:20:43 UTC] sensoji: People, go to EpicNameBro's twtich right now and see him stream past 7/7. He's been doing it for 3 days and he's still up. He is popular, so someone must have reported him by now. He still gets subs, donations and cheers.
[2017-04-21 18:21:03 UTC] jwalker70: I think I can get away with doing my head during the break.
[2017-04-21 18:21:09 UTC] blue_blur64: Being big has nothing to do with it
[2017-04-21 18:21:12 UTC] darksydephil: there are multiple instances of people being suspended for streaming after 7/7 and also having teir youtube channels getting striken with copyright strikes
[2017-04-21 18:21:12 UTC] bobbi_ling: epicnamebro in 2017 MingLee
[2017-04-21 18:21:28 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey Bobbi R)
[2017-04-21 18:21:31 UTC] ornightz: @sensoji Saying this again, ONLY phil can't go Pass 7/7 , Everyone else is fine , Just Phil
[2017-04-21 18:21:36 UTC] darksydephil: just because some people "got away with it" doesn't make me immune
[2017-04-21 18:21:36 UTC] bobbi_ling: oi jim
[2017-04-21 18:21:41 UTC] jwalker70: have any of the parts been claimed?
[2017-04-21 18:21:57 UTC] 0megaj0ker: ATLUS are f$cking idiots for the restrictions FailFish
[2017-04-21 18:22:04 UTC] leokira997: ive seen staff chilling in chat in streams past 7/7
[2017-04-21 18:22:06 UTC] sanguinenite: lol maybe someone at atlusUSA is a DSP detractor.
[2017-04-21 18:22:15 UTC] splitplaythru: It's their game, they can do whatever they want with it.
[2017-04-21 18:22:19 UTC] cherry_dood: lol. yeah that's probably what it is
[2017-04-21 18:22:21 UTC] bethebaby: It's certainly not a smart business move, but it is their right to do it.
[2017-04-21 18:22:23 UTC] sanguinenite: No, it is not
[2017-04-21 18:22:27 UTC] blue_blur64: holy crap I just did an attack that did 4544 damage O_o
[2017-04-21 18:22:29 UTC] ratchefan12: @0megaj0ker you can say fuck omega
[2017-04-21 18:22:35 UTC] darksydephil: stream working for everyone?
[2017-04-21 18:22:36 UTC] jwalker70: I mean they did post on the NYX detractor video
[2017-04-21 18:22:38 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yup
[2017-04-21 18:22:39 UTC] sensoji: I'm not saying Phil should risk it, I'm saying others have complained about it and done it anyway and are fine. If some people have gotten strikes then that sucks but it's inconsistent.
[2017-04-21 18:22:40 UTC] ufccurbstomp: well there WAS that comment by ATlusUSA on Phil's last persona 3 video :P
[2017-04-21 18:22:42 UTC] bobbi_ling: yes
[2017-04-21 18:22:56 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @ratchefan12 I know, but only I feel like it
[2017-04-21 18:22:58 UTC] ratchefan12: what comment?
[2017-04-21 18:23:04 UTC] sanguinenite: If I buy a game, I can take the disc out and shit on it if I wanted to. No one should stop me from streaming the game. The only exception is me burning the disc and re-selling the game
[2017-04-21 18:23:04 UTC] liesuponlies: No real benefit for going over 7/7 now, since others are doing it
[2017-04-21 18:23:16 UTC] vendatus: again AtlusJPN told AtlusUSA to set the restrictions Kappa
[2017-04-21 18:23:17 UTC] jwalker70: "Rage quit salt" or something
[2017-04-21 18:23:19 UTC] finiteresource: persona 5 is pretty average, better play bloodborne dlc
[2017-04-21 18:23:22 UTC] ratchefan12: @ufccurbstomp what comment
[2017-04-21 18:23:27 UTC] darksydephil: um....is the stream working? nobody responded
[2017-04-21 18:23:30 UTC] bethebaby: "The charm salt is real" is what AtlusUSA said.
[2017-04-21 18:23:32 UTC] blue_blur64: oh, it is
[2017-04-21 18:23:33 UTC] popsicolo: It is
[2017-04-21 18:23:35 UTC] 0megaj0ker: It's working SeemsGood
[2017-04-21 18:23:37 UTC] cherry_dood: When you own a game, you don't own the rights to it. They still own the intellectual property.
[2017-04-21 18:23:39 UTC] ratchefan12: yes its working phil
[2017-04-21 18:23:39 UTC] darksydephil: ok thanks lol
[2017-04-21 18:23:42 UTC] bobbi_ling: i said yes philliper
[2017-04-21 18:23:43 UTC] sensoji: Yes. it's up, but low view count.
[2017-04-21 18:23:44 UTC] darksydephil: ill tweet that we're live then
[2017-04-21 18:23:54 UTC] sanguinenite: I hear the stream only after I refreshed. Twitch is so weird
[2017-04-21 18:23:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Bobbi replied
[2017-04-21 18:24:03 UTC] bobbi_ling: and jimmy
[2017-04-21 18:24:15 UTC] bobbi_ling: dspCowboy
[2017-04-21 18:24:33 UTC] liesuponlies: some times I have to stop and start the stream as the audio cuts out
[2017-04-21 18:24:37 UTC] renastella: hola

The game is still the publisher(or dev's) IP. It's their right to do whatever they please with the IP. If that means setting stream embargoes then oh well.

[2017-04-21 23:01:13 UTC] mythstorm24: How
[2017-04-21 23:01:14 UTC] vanalfreyd: No more persona :(
[2017-04-21 23:01:39 UTC] kushiyakitori: @MythStorm24, at least as of a few days ago I could. When you go on the pricing screen there was an option to watch an ad to get 5 or more bits per ad viewed
[2017-04-21 23:01:45 UTC] kushiyakitori: thats what I always used
[2017-04-21 23:01:47 UTC] mythstorm24: Really?
[2017-04-21 23:01:48 UTC] nolbert87: @HowlintheDeep had to do it been saving that one for a bit...no pun intended.
[2017-04-21 23:02:00 UTC] pcgamehunter: Welp I'm gonna switch from grinding and watching P5 stream to full on playing it, so I probably won't be on any streams for a while, so cya when Phil plays something I want to see. :)
[2017-04-21 23:02:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: if you're from the USA,Canada and Australia you can bits from watching ads MythStorm24
[2017-04-21 23:02:10 UTC] kushiyakitori: @MythStorm24, yep. It was an easy way to get bits. I didn't pay for any bits for as long as I've cheered
[2017-04-21 23:02:11 UTC] pcgamehunter: or persona i guess
[2017-04-21 23:02:16 UTC] mythstorm24: I'm from Canada but I don't have that option?
[2017-04-21 23:02:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: if you're a sub KushiYakitori you're not meant to get ads so don't get bits I think
[2017-04-21 23:02:42 UTC] kushiyakitori: @theycallmejimbob, oh really? is that part of the new change? I had been getting some by watching the ads on purpose before
[2017-04-21 23:02:43 UTC] darksydephil: thanks everyone for a great final stream!
[2017-04-21 23:02:48 UTC] mythstorm24: Do I have to go to a dedicated page?

[2017-04-21 23:02:59 UTC] nolbert87: @HowlintheDeep seemed fitting since he is basically forced to stop a game that people seem stop enjoy..which in turn gives him revenue.
[2017-04-21 23:03:14 UTC] kushiyakitori: @MythStorm24, the option was always available to me as long as I was in a channels chat
[2017-04-21 23:03:19 UTC] mythstorm24: @DarksydePhil, Thank you for introducing me to Persona. Bought the game because of you and I can't wait to play it.
[2017-04-21 23:03:25 UTC] kushiyakitori: @DarksydePhil, hopefully the ban is lifted soon and we can see past 7/7
[2017-04-21 23:03:32 UTC] darksydephil: nice MythStorm24 !
[2017-04-21 23:03:40 UTC] ornightz: P5 can be played on 7/7 just not 7/8 but wouldn't make a difference

[2017-04-21 23:03:48 UTC] nolbert87: yeah it is what it is...@DarksydePhil can't say its my cup of tea but i can see why people like it.

[2017-04-21 23:07:23 UTC] darksydephil: and supposedly im getting 3 for free as well, although im not allowed to play it right away lol
[2017-04-21 23:07:37 UTC] mythstorm24: Wait for real?
[2017-04-21 23:07:49 UTC] mythstorm24: That gives you the third game when it releases?
[2017-04-21 23:08:19 UTC] darksydephil: no
[2017-04-21 23:08:44 UTC] darksydephil: spike chunsoft/MIS USA contacted me and thanked me for playing the first game, said they thought it was excellent quality and helped promote their game so they're going to give me part 3 for free
[2017-04-21 23:08:59 UTC] shiro_akiama: phil will there ever be a 24 hour stream
[2017-04-21 23:09:00 UTC] mythstorm24: That's awesome!
[2017-04-21 23:09:25 UTC] mythstorm24: Well I can agree. I would have never seen the series without you playing it.
[2017-04-21 23:09:47 UTC] jwalker70: 24 stream as his last one maybe.
[2017-04-21 23:10:39 UTC] jwalker70: phil are you considering a MGS Redemption run?
[2017-04-21 23:10:44 UTC] darksydephil: i dunno
[2017-04-21 23:10:50 UTC] darksydephil: sadly konami is claiming all of my MGS playthroughs
[2017-04-21 23:10:57 UTC] darksydephil: so its probably not gonna work out
[2017-04-21 23:11:08 UTC] jwalker70: i would prefer that over DS2
[2017-04-21 23:11:11 UTC] darksydephil: unless i find a managed partnership
[2017-04-21 23:11:31 UTC] jwalker70: have you tried full screen?
[2017-04-21 23:11:43 UTC] elipsion: I took a drink for everytime you said The Bottom Line in ask the king phil
[2017-04-21 23:11:45 UTC] elipsion: was not a good time
[2017-04-21 23:12:20 UTC] darksydephil: fullscreen is bad, low rev share compared to other partners
[2017-04-21 23:12:29 UTC] jwalker70: you must be so hung over that you snapped your neck
[2017-04-21 23:12:31 UTC] darksydephil: and they dont offer managed partnership from what i can tell
[2017-04-21 23:12:58 UTC] jwalker70: they have lots of other benefits though
[2017-04-21 23:13:46 UTC] darksydephil: not really. all networks pretty much have the same exact benefits
[2017-04-21 23:13:54 UTC] shiro_akiama: doesn't fullscreen own roosterteeth
[2017-04-21 23:14:16 UTC] jwalker70: Any update on why ad revenue is down?
[2017-04-21 23:14:21 UTC] darksydephil: as in, some form of support line, possible promotion on their stuff (which never does anything), music partnerships (which they all have). usually nothing solid like free games or product campaigns which is what you really need to make money
[2017-04-21 23:17:07 UTC] jwalker70: annnnd He's gone.
[2017-04-21 23:18:10 UTC] ornightz: and So am I , bck Sunday take care everyone GN
