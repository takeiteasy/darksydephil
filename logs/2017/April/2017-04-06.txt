[2017-04-06 02:08:08 UTC] howlinthedeep: It's impossible to get 100% on the first exam in these persona games

[2017-04-06 02:10:17 UTC] blue_blur64: Hold on, I still have the guide I used for 100%
[2017-04-06 02:10:26 UTC] eliqsir: I really hope Atlus never caters to these sjws for P6 or the new JRPG dantasy project
[2017-04-06 02:10:29 UTC] howlinthedeep: Oh there's guides for this?

[2017-04-06 02:38:19 UTC] akioartorius: @DarksydePhil , the door is actually open I think, you went the wrong way before
[2017-04-06 02:38:36 UTC] jaxunhero: Woooo
[2017-04-06 02:38:44 UTC] blue_blur64: It's 250 minimum
[2017-04-06 02:38:51 UTC] somone192: Aww
[2017-04-06 02:38:57 UTC] chocorampage: wow i didnt know you could do that. goof stuff
[2017-04-06 02:39:17 UTC] eternia_forever: oh ok
[2017-04-06 02:39:32 UTC] chocorampage: good stuff*
[2017-04-06 02:39:33 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Didn't this game come out in 2016 cause I searched up Persona 5 and it gave 2016 weird.
[2017-04-06 02:39:48 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @eternia_forever the issue is Atlus is straight up banning this game to be Let's Played
[2017-04-06 02:40:30 UTC] akioartorius: can Phil still stream the boss battles?
[2017-04-06 02:40:34 UTC] ritzemac18: How long has he been playing for?
[2017-04-06 02:40:35 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil you must have passed it when you were getting chased by the light
[2017-04-06 02:40:38 UTC] andreii1984: this game has metal gear stealth?
[2017-04-06 02:40:45 UTC] blue_blur64: He just started tonight ritz
[2017-04-06 02:40:52 UTC] jaxunhero: @eternia_forever it's actually atlus Japan that's forcing this restriction by making atlususa follow it and enforce.
[2017-04-06 02:40:53 UTC] blue_blur64: you missed one battle
[2017-04-06 02:40:58 UTC] garlicshrimp: did he forget the r1 shortcut thing
[2017-04-06 02:41:02 UTC] ritzemac18: Ok awesome
[2017-04-06 02:41:04 UTC] vendatus: Atlus would have to file the complaint, Twitch admins review it, then they decide to suspend if the claim is valid CoolStoryBob
[2017-04-06 02:41:15 UTC] derichloveslemur: What do you think of the soundtrack 10/10 Phil?
[2017-04-06 02:41:20 UTC] blue_blur64: Unless it's at 0% you have to be behind the enemy to get the ambush
[2017-04-06 02:41:22 UTC] howlinthedeep: more than that silent phil ran around for a while too
[2017-04-06 02:41:33 UTC] eternia_forever: What i was saying is not put the videos on youtube at all, only on twitch if bits and tips were enough , I thought you could get away with it on twitch just not youtyube ??
[2017-04-06 02:41:49 UTC] garlicshrimp: no twitch
[2017-04-06 02:41:51 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @eternia_forever nope, banned from streaming past 7/7 as well
[2017-04-06 02:41:54 UTC] garlicshrimp: no anything past that point dude
[2017-04-06 02:41:55 UTC] blue_blur64: No eternia, he can't even do that
[2017-04-06 02:41:56 UTC] jaxunhero: @vendatus but have you seen twitch streamers steaming this whole game past 7/7?
[2017-04-06 02:42:05 UTC] eternia_forever: oh ok
[2017-04-06 02:42:16 UTC] retrothicc2b: dspGlitch let's go philly boy
[2017-04-06 02:42:36 UTC] eternia_forever: just a thought i had thanks for clarifying guys
[2017-04-06 02:42:40 UTC] chocorampage: @DarksydePhil The music in this game never gets old to me. Its so good!
[2017-04-06 02:42:47 UTC] akioartorius: and curse
[2017-04-06 02:42:48 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil The pixies are actually most weak to ICE
[2017-04-06 02:42:49 UTC] dragonjarvis: Phil remember the assist option! When it is weebs turn and you have a persona, which has an attack strong against an enemy, you do not need to select the persona manually, the assist option does it for you and makes battle faster
[2017-04-06 02:43:10 UTC] vendatus: I watch select streamers not like I go into the directory LUL
[2017-04-06 02:43:14 UTC] blue_blur64: Phil, that wasn't strike weakness. That's gun weakness :P
[2017-04-06 02:43:31 UTC] eternia_forever: well in that case then wtf atlus dammmmmmmmm
[2017-04-06 02:43:35 UTC] andreii1984: ME Andromeda patch comes out on 6th april, looks like it fixes some issues
[2017-04-06 02:43:42 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Did you try the talking option yet?
[2017-04-06 02:43:53 UTC] akioartorius: yes derich
[2017-04-06 02:43:53 UTC] vendatus: Thats just what Hassan told me SeemsGood
[2017-04-06 02:44:10 UTC] howlinthedeep: @darksydephil remember atlus said not to show boss fights dspAngrydsp
[2017-04-06 02:44:19 UTC] marky117: Kappa
[2017-04-06 02:44:22 UTC] darthvidarviking: IS this Mr. boss?
[2017-04-06 02:44:32 UTC] howlinthedeep: this is not a boss fight tho
[2017-04-06 02:44:34 UTC] dragonjarvis: why is morgana so thirsty for ann?
[2017-04-06 02:44:38 UTC] bbt_2017: get a silky persona ASAP
[2017-04-06 02:44:57 UTC] bbt_2017: Silky is OP later in this dungeon
[2017-04-06 02:45:12 UTC] blue_blur64: If you have a persona that you had before, you have to say that you didn't ask for this
[2017-04-06 02:45:23 UTC] blue_blur64: if you talk to a shadow I mean
[2017-04-06 02:45:28 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Did you save yet so far or not yet
[2017-04-06 02:45:32 UTC] garlicshrimp: where the fuck is this treasure
[2017-04-06 02:45:34 UTC] sonicsergey: you need to pay attention to what is being said
[2017-04-06 02:45:34 UTC] andreii1984: you can just fuse those personas you don't need
[2017-04-06 02:45:41 UTC] chocorampage: @DarksydePhil When you want an item if its a persona you had before you have to say you didnt ask for this as they will try to get back with you
[2017-04-06 02:46:02 UTC] eternia_forever: ahhhhhhhhhh
[2017-04-06 02:46:09 UTC] coralguy: dspHmm
[2017-04-06 02:46:22 UTC] alee000: cheer100
[2017-04-06 02:46:23 UTC] garlicshrimp: whats the picture of the teacher suppsoed to mean?
[2017-04-06 02:46:26 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil upgrade your personas to level 8 sound good
[2017-04-06 02:46:48 UTC] blue_blur64: That he thinks of himself as a god garlic
[2017-04-06 02:46:49 UTC] winderfiend764: Anyone hear of a way to get past the 7/7 thing?
[2017-04-06 02:46:54 UTC] blue_blur64: You can't
[2017-04-06 02:47:05 UTC] sonicsergey: just go past it
[2017-04-06 02:47:10 UTC] sonicsergey: and you'll win
[2017-04-06 02:47:11 UTC] vendatus: KillScottKill is at 12/16 LUL
[2017-04-06 02:47:18 UTC] sonicsergey: a copyright stike
[2017-04-06 02:47:18 UTC] eternia_forever: man that was a close one bro sheesh for the top spot i am refering too lol @alee000
[2017-04-06 02:47:37 UTC] blue_blur64: sonic :D
[2017-04-06 02:47:39 UTC] howlinthedeep: It's not too hard to just find personas at your level so upgrading isn't too neccessary
[2017-04-06 02:47:45 UTC] akioartorius: is KillScottKill still going or did he get in trouble
[2017-04-06 02:47:45 UTC] miss_kelcher: well, if atlus takes down phil's youtube videos, he can always upload them to his pornhub :P
[2017-04-06 02:47:53 UTC] chocorampage: @DarksydePhil When you want an item if its a persona you had before you have to say you didnt ask for this as they will try to get back with you
[2017-04-06 02:48:01 UTC] howlinthedeep: He has a pornhub :O
[2017-04-06 02:48:04 UTC] eternia_forever: lol @Miss_Kelcher

[2017-04-06 02:48:21 UTC] winderfiend764: Not even covering the date in the upper left?
[2017-04-06 02:48:26 UTC] howlinthedeep: Hmmm...there's one video I can think that would be up there
[2017-04-06 02:48:33 UTC] andreii1984: pornhub is banned in russia :(
[2017-04-06 02:48:44 UTC] howlinthedeep: I wonder why andreii1984
[2017-04-06 02:48:47 UTC] ritzemac18: I want to buy this game and play it for myself but I can't stop watching Phil play it lol
[2017-04-06 02:48:47 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil Don't you remember you have 2 other personas that you stored away that had Zionga which was super effective.
[2017-04-06 02:48:48 UTC] jaxunhero: @darksydephil you have a snuff soul remember
[2017-04-06 02:48:51 UTC] miss_kelcher: aaaw, poor andreii
[2017-04-06 02:48:52 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @winderfiend764 i'm pretty sure Atlus would know where you are in the game if you covered the date
[2017-04-06 02:49:00 UTC] retrothicc2b: stylish idneedy
[2017-04-06 02:49:11 UTC] sonicsergey: I like the way Mona talks

[2017-04-06 02:50:54 UTC] mrmittensthefluffycat: using the Izanagi lv20 is cheap
[2017-04-06 02:51:00 UTC] garlicshrimp: if phil were to try to get past 7/7
[2017-04-06 02:51:02 UTC] retrothicc2b: >( i'm srry eternia SwiftRage !!

[2017-04-06 02:51:34 UTC] chocorampage: the cat does not have the baton ability yet phil
[2017-04-06 02:51:36 UTC] amplifyed: you don't have the baton pass for her

[2017-04-06 02:52:06 UTC] howlinthedeep: As pops would say
[2017-04-06 02:52:06 UTC] akioartorius: Morgana is a dude

[2017-04-06 02:52:42 UTC] cinsolace92: phil do you think morgana acts a bit like teddy from p4??
[2017-04-06 02:52:45 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Just asking Do you remember Izanagi had Zionga which is a super affective electric type move.
[2017-04-06 02:52:49 UTC] alee000: i was suscribed before but kept on forgetting to renew lol
[2017-04-06 02:52:52 UTC] easton_taylor1: StrawBeary Nothing I Could Do
[2017-04-06 02:52:53 UTC] blue_blur64: Morgana is nothing like Teddie :P
[2017-04-06 02:52:56 UTC] winderfiend764: Is Morgana confirmed a dude ?
[2017-04-06 02:53:02 UTC] vendatus: Morgana is an Asari Kappa
[2017-04-06 02:53:05 UTC] miss_kelcher: Morgana is trans
[2017-04-06 02:53:08 UTC] howlinthedeep: You guys realize there's not just two genders right?
[2017-04-06 02:53:11 UTC] jaxunhero: Isn't it make more items such as lock picks?
[2017-04-06 02:53:13 UTC] akioartorius: it stated that is is confirmed that Morgana is non binary
[2017-04-06 02:53:19 UTC] derichloveslemur: Oh damn that sucks
[2017-04-06 02:53:26 UTC] derichloveslemur: hopefully before 7/7

[2017-04-06 02:53:30 UTC] garlicshrimp: thought someone said R1 gets you shortcut to target enemy weakness
[2017-04-06 02:53:31 UTC] miss_kelcher: @HowlintheDeep Wrong
[2017-04-06 02:53:33 UTC] sire1986: you can use izanagi
[2017-04-06 02:53:34 UTC] mrmittensthefluffycat: you can use Izanagi
[2017-04-06 02:53:34 UTC] ands_: Morgana is a guy but that is a spoiler.
[2017-04-06 02:53:34 UTC] sire1986: now
[2017-04-06 02:53:35 UTC] dragonjarvis: yes you can use izanagi xD
[2017-04-06 02:53:42 UTC] vendatus: Deep don't start that Kappa
[2017-04-06 02:53:42 UTC] yvysus: yes you can used both of them
[2017-04-06 02:53:42 UTC] ands_: Rather they think they are male.
[2017-04-06 02:53:47 UTC] amplifyed: I think you can use him but it's pretty damn cheap
[2017-04-06 02:54:12 UTC] jaxunhero: You can
[2017-04-06 02:54:12 UTC] howlinthedeep: :D some people here have been triggered before by the statement

[2017-04-06 02:54:21 UTC] derichloveslemur: you can use Izanagi it hink
[2017-04-06 02:54:21 UTC] cinsolace92: eh opinions are opinions
[2017-04-06 02:54:25 UTC] akioartorius: bufu
[2017-04-06 02:54:31 UTC] jaxunhero: Try it
[2017-04-06 02:54:37 UTC] ands_: @Derichloveslemur Yes. They are very long because they aren't random anymore.
[2017-04-06 02:54:39 UTC] mrmittensthefluffycat: more dlc persona in the future
[2017-04-06 02:54:45 UTC] drowsylouis: Whooaaaaaa, looking cool, Joker!
[2017-04-06 02:54:54 UTC] 0megaj0ker: nope
[2017-04-06 02:54:54 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, Try Izanagi out always try and find out.
[2017-04-06 02:54:59 UTC] ands_: No. He's too high level.
[2017-04-06 02:55:01 UTC] akioartorius: no pHil
[2017-04-06 02:55:03 UTC] jaxunhero: No
[2017-04-06 02:55:05 UTC] jaxunhero: no
[2017-04-06 02:55:10 UTC] derichloveslemur: no @DarksydePhil
[2017-04-06 02:55:11 UTC] ands_: No. You don't
[2017-04-06 02:55:12 UTC] andreii1984: the game will get much harder later on, lvl that izanagi
[2017-04-06 02:55:13 UTC] derichloveslemur: I don't think so
[2017-04-06 02:55:16 UTC] 0megaj0ker: your to low level for them
[2017-04-06 02:55:18 UTC] blue_blur64: ands, lvl only matters when recruiting/fusing
[2017-04-06 02:55:27 UTC] sonicsergey: your too weak to recruit him
[2017-04-06 02:55:29 UTC] ands_: @blue_blur64 Absolutely not.
[2017-04-06 02:55:36 UTC] akioartorius: @DarksydePhil , you don't have them, you are not lvl 9
[2017-04-06 02:55:39 UTC] derichloveslemur: Try Izanagi and see if it works Phil?
[2017-04-06 02:55:49 UTC] ands_: @blue_blur64 If you are too low level you can't get them.
[2017-04-06 02:55:53 UTC] blue_blur64: if lvl mattered, then Phil shouldn't have been able to summon them from the compendium
[2017-04-06 02:56:14 UTC] mrmittensthefluffycat: he already has Izanagi oroFail
[2017-04-06 02:56:18 UTC] blue_blur64: and they definitely shouldn't be in the party right now
[2017-04-06 02:56:19 UTC] ands_: @blue_blur64 He was only able to summon a DLC Persona. Clearly that isn't normal. Normal enemies do not work that way.
[2017-04-06 02:56:22 UTC] doctorzzz: they are lvl 9
[2017-04-06 02:56:28 UTC] blue_blur64: I know that
[2017-04-06 02:56:29 UTC] jaxunhero: @darksydephil need to craft more lock picks
[2017-04-06 02:56:31 UTC] akioartorius: izanagi and izanagi piscao is dlc so it was free the first time
[2017-04-06 02:56:34 UTC] eternia_forever: i have you know that i am using butter from grassfed cows imported from ireland, all natural peanut butter, and premium strawberry jelly with a touch of honey so there bro lol @RetroTHICC2B
[2017-04-06 02:56:38 UTC] ands_: Then what are you going on about?
[2017-04-06 02:56:38 UTC] alee000: anybody play persona 2 if so is it anygood?
[2017-04-06 02:56:39 UTC] blue_blur64: But he can still use Izanagi because it's dlc
[2017-04-06 02:56:47 UTC] sonicsergey: How long is this gonna take to reach the final boss?
[2017-04-06 02:56:52 UTC] derichloveslemur: is this the end?
[2017-04-06 02:56:59 UTC] ands_: @Derichloveslemur No.

[2017-04-06 02:57:29 UTC] retrothicc2b: @eternia_forever i believe you eternia, i believe you bro. you r truly living da life my man
[2017-04-06 02:57:33 UTC] blue_blur64: here's a perfect example. It's like saying that if you fused a persona and it leveled up because of the boost, by your logic Phil's no longer allowed to use that persona
[2017-04-06 02:57:36 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil are you running low on SP for your characters I see the purple bars are pretty low.
[2017-04-06 02:57:38 UTC] kristiannox: Hello everyone how is everyone today
[2017-04-06 02:57:40 UTC] eternia_forever: lol @HowlintheDeep

[2017-04-06 02:57:58 UTC] blue_blur64: just wait akio
[2017-04-06 02:58:01 UTC] ands_: @blue_blur64 No. That's not what ANYONE but you are talking about.
[2017-04-06 02:58:09 UTC] retrothicc2b: B)
[2017-04-06 02:58:10 UTC] doctorzzz: he should go out and save and come back
[2017-04-06 02:58:21 UTC] ands_: You're arguing against a point no one made.
[2017-04-06 02:58:22 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil This is hard but you got this swiftYes
[2017-04-06 02:58:24 UTC] blue_blur64: Ok, so why is Izanagi in Phil current persona party?
[2017-04-06 02:58:38 UTC] retrothicc2b: pre-order bonus?
[2017-04-06 02:58:47 UTC] eternia_forever: HeyGuys
[2017-04-06 02:58:54 UTC] akioartorius: Izanagi and Izanagi Picasso are dlc so they are free summons the first time
[2017-04-06 02:58:56 UTC] ands_: @blue_blur64 Because it's a pre-order DLC. Seriously what is your point? We were talking about the Hold Up failing.
[2017-04-06 02:59:07 UTC] derichloveslemur: Omg!
[2017-04-06 02:59:14 UTC] blue_blur64: No, people were arguing about being able to use Izanagi
[2017-04-06 02:59:25 UTC] derichloveslemur: weak to ice too
[2017-04-06 02:59:32 UTC] doctorzzz: he is so done
[2017-04-06 02:59:39 UTC] ands_: @blue_blur64 You specially mentioned me. . .I never made a comment about him not being able to use the DLC.
[2017-04-06 02:59:43 UTC] howlinthedeep: preorder bonus is part of the game so it's not cheating to use it
[2017-04-06 02:59:46 UTC] garlicshrimp: morgana sounds like it came right out of a pbs show
[2017-04-06 02:59:50 UTC] retrothicc2b: if its pre order, then everybody is prob using izanagi, maybe it's a needed boost for mericful mode
[2017-04-06 02:59:52 UTC] howlinthedeep: just like the bkh is not cheating
[2017-04-06 02:59:57 UTC] doctorzzz: r1 r1 r1

[2017-04-06 03:00:43 UTC] howlingwolfjoey: i think there was already a female lead in P2

[2017-04-06 18:13:14 UTC] darksydephil: no, we have high sales tax here. so you pay high taxes if you choose to spend money. which is the RIGHT way to go about it
[2017-04-06 18:13:16 UTC] nothing4thebest: yeah i got a decent return
[2017-04-06 18:13:17 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: HeyGuys
[2017-04-06 18:13:41 UTC] nothing4thebest: why should people be punished for spending money? that makes no sense
[2017-04-06 18:13:50 UTC] darksydephil: in connecticut you get not only high sales tax but state income tax as well. they literally rob you and the state is fucking terrible at spending the money they take from you
[2017-04-06 18:13:59 UTC] darksydephil: AND high property tax too
[2017-04-06 18:14:08 UTC] nothing4thebest: CT has really nice roads tho
[2017-04-06 18:14:17 UTC] darksydephil: um, fuck no they dont!

[2017-04-06 18:14:39 UTC] goldencolts: but CT is a rich state how can such a thing be
[2017-04-06 18:15:03 UTC] darksydephil: goldencolts, its not rich at all. a few rich people live there and drive the whole fucking economy up into a bracket where everyone pays insane taxes because of those few rich jerks
[2017-04-06 18:15:05 UTC] errnoent: nothing4thebest I wouldn't consider tax punishment, it's the misuse of tax revenue by elected officials that's punishment
[2017-04-06 18:15:08 UTC] cherry_dood: It's possible that the roads in CT were repaired in the last two years, no?
[2017-04-06 18:15:29 UTC] nothing4thebest: CT has a lot of well educated people and a lot of ghetto people its a weird combinationm
[2017-04-06 18:15:42 UTC] darksydephil: ok stream starting up
[2017-04-06 18:15:44 UTC] goldencolts: oh deer thats too bad
[2017-04-06 18:15:52 UTC] cherry_dood: @nothing4thebest Every state has that dichotomy
[2017-04-06 18:15:54 UTC] nothing4thebest: like lots of doctors and stuff but then ghettos with gangs and shit
[2017-04-06 18:16:02 UTC] nothing4thebest: no CT is small so its mostly doctors and shit
[2017-04-06 18:16:06 UTC] soulrider95: DarksydePhil, have you considered buying a used car instead of leasing? Leasing is really dumb since you don't even own anything at the end tbh
[2017-04-06 18:16:36 UTC] nothing4thebest: leasing is good if u have to commute i think
[2017-04-06 18:16:38 UTC] theycallmejimbob: we're live
[2017-04-06 18:16:38 UTC] errnoent: soulrider95 keep in mind maintenance costs
[2017-04-06 18:16:56 UTC] goldencolts: it depends sometimes leasing is better, cars aren't a magic equity object
[2017-04-06 18:16:58 UTC] cherry_dood: Leasing is the dumbest thing you can do with a car. You're on the hook for a lease payment every month for the rest of your life unless you decide to buy. AND you still need to come up with a downpayment.
[2017-04-06 18:16:58 UTC] errnoent: If you're going to buy a car, better make damn sure it's a good one
[2017-04-06 18:17:04 UTC] darksydephil: we're probably going to look to buy a used car
[2017-04-06 18:17:17 UTC] errnoent: Goldencolts exactly

[2017-04-06 18:17:31 UTC] darksydephil: the reason we leased the bmw twice was because i wasn't sure i would be able to always afford it. and good thing thats what we did bc look at the siituation now lol
[2017-04-06 18:17:34 UTC] soulrider95: I'd rather own a car than waste money on a lease and have nothing to show on it
[2017-04-06 18:17:38 UTC] cherry_dood: I did the math when I bought my last car, after having leased. It's more expensive long term to lease.
[2017-04-06 18:17:53 UTC] wolfofthedawn: hey chat, and happy birthday phil :D
[2017-04-06 18:17:54 UTC] errnoent: soulrider95 would you though? consider depreciation and maintenance

[2017-04-06 18:19:02 UTC] darksydephil: hybrids are out of the question, they cost far too much and we dont drive enough to get the fuel efficiency benefits. if we drove on teh highway all the time that would be a different story but everything is very close by to us

[2017-04-06 18:19:33 UTC] soulrider95: You can save a LOT of money by doing basic maintenance yourself
[2017-04-06 18:19:40 UTC] samslayer2012: get a motorcycle
[2017-04-06 18:19:40 UTC] darksydephil: honestly what we get will depend on what's around here available. so we have to start looking shortly
[2017-04-06 18:19:44 UTC] darksydephil: we only have about 2.5 months left
[2017-04-06 18:19:46 UTC] soulrider95: Oil change is $30 instead of whatever the dealership charges
[2017-04-06 18:20:16 UTC] errnoent: soulrider95 that's true, until you get to the point where you need to do serious maintenance
[2017-04-06 18:20:16 UTC] soulrider95: $10 + 14mm wrench and 15 minutes of time to swap a belt
[2017-04-06 18:20:16 UTC] cherry_dood: Yeah changing the basics on your car is stupid easy
[2017-04-06 18:20:29 UTC] errnoent: soulrider95 not piddly little oil changes
[2017-04-06 18:20:39 UTC] cherry_dood: Oil, changing lights, etc. Do it all myself and I have no background in this stuff.
[2017-04-06 18:20:40 UTC] darksydephil: most car repair shops do basic maintenance on the cheap as well
[2017-04-06 18:20:45 UTC] soulrider95: errnoent, if you do basic stuff regularly you don't need the big repairs as often
[2017-04-06 18:20:52 UTC] darksydephil: as long as your car is common and parts are easily available
[2017-04-06 18:20:56 UTC] nothing4thebest: leanna might like a prius
[2017-04-06 18:20:57 UTC] soulrider95: Not as cheap as doing it yourself, and you don't know what quality you're getting

[2017-04-06 20:49:23 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Its hard to explain what I mean
