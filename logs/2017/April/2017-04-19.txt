[2017-04-19 20:00:56 UTC] hapticbabyman: @bethebaby it's his loss.  He could be competing in tourneys for big money and get lots of attendance off of something like SFV
[2017-04-19 20:01:00 UTC] conky89: But SF4 came out at a time when fighting games were kind of dead. It was refreshing to get a classic style of fighting game

[2017-04-19 20:01:53 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Conky89 Fighting games weren't dead then, I don't buy into that myth.  Tekken 5 outsold SFIV (all versions), DOA4 had come out, VF4 did really well and VF5 had come out doing well in most markets too etc.
[2017-04-19 20:01:54 UTC] 1buttondash: if capcom didn't rush SFV out last year and just put more time into it and it came out this year with all the content it has now it woulda been huge
[2017-04-19 20:02:01 UTC] shenmueps4: @bigestdspfan ah man go away

[2017-04-19 20:02:19 UTC] conky89: I meant before SF4 came out fighting games were kind of dead
[2017-04-19 20:02:23 UTC] hapticbabyman: And Brawl exploded like a few months before SFIV came out; fighting games were doing well.
[2017-04-19 20:02:30 UTC] radicalenzyme: Is he going to try to do the minecart thing again?

[2017-04-19 20:02:43 UTC] jaxunhero: @radicalenzyme no
[2017-04-19 20:02:45 UTC] conky89: SF4 helped to make them quite popular again and caused reboots to occur
[2017-04-19 20:02:47 UTC] bigestdspfan: why play child game? it will attract all the detractors lol
[2017-04-19 20:02:51 UTC] dgprolific: pumpkin is on drugs

[2017-04-19 20:03:14 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Conky89 I don't buy that either.  MK didn't need SF to get another MK; the PS2 MK games did very well

[2017-04-19 20:04:08 UTC] hapticbabyman: I'd say SFIV helped get stuff like Skullgirls done tho, definitely.  But stuff like Blazblue were going to come out whether or not SFIV existed

[2017-04-19 20:17:38 UTC] conky89: Or was that not really LTG?
[2017-04-19 20:17:43 UTC] bethebaby: Tevin actually played LTG once. I think LTG won, but that's OK because LTG is a POS and Tevin's a good d00d

[2017-04-19 21:13:13 UTC] bethebaby: @bigestdspfan Uhhh, because Atlus' embargo is explicitly for those uploading or streaming footage of the game to the internet? It doesn't affect the common gamer who buys a game just to play it for themselves.

[2017-04-19 21:21:04 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: show him phil bethe
[2017-04-19 21:21:09 UTC] bethebaby: @bigestdspfan Why should they care? This controversy has been going on since the launch and they haven't lifted the embargo. Probably not going to. Like it or not, they have a right to do so.
[2017-04-19 21:21:11 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: he might like it and stop crying

[2017-04-19 21:21:53 UTC] lioncock: yeah i just said that
[2017-04-19 21:21:58 UTC] lioncock: thats why im confused
[2017-04-19 21:21:58 UTC] bethebaby: @Lioncock Well Phil played Persona 3 years after release.
[2017-04-19 21:22:17 UTC] bigestdspfan: @bethebaby yea well people will just give the game bad reviews then
[2017-04-19 21:22:31 UTC] encelor: people calm your jimmies
[2017-04-19 21:22:36 UTC] phoenixrising2015: For anyone who doesn't think they aren't banning look up Admiral Bahroo gets banned. Theres a clip up of him playing on 7/7, being nice, and suddenly boom suspended
[2017-04-19 21:22:36 UTC] ratchefan12: shakes head at moor and leaves
[2017-04-19 21:22:48 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I did post the clip but nightbot got me
[2017-04-19 21:22:52 UTC] bethebaby: @bigestdspfan They're not going to give the game bad reviews just because of the stupid embargo that affects no one but streamers.
[2017-04-19 21:22:53 UTC] bigestdspfan: @Phoenixrising2015 advertising someone in phil's chat?
[2017-04-19 21:22:57 UTC] phoenixrising2015: No
[2017-04-19 21:23:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I'm providing proof that Atlus is banning
[2017-04-19 21:23:08 UTC] bigestdspfan: @bethebaby they have right to though
[2017-04-19 21:23:10 UTC] moor888: fuck spoilers
[2017-04-19 21:23:23 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I don't give a crap about that guy
[2017-04-19 21:23:24 UTC] lioncock: who in reality is really giving the game a bad review over a stream embargo?
[2017-04-19 21:23:27 UTC] popsicolo: https://clips.twitch.tv/FrigidFreezingPandaKappaClaus
[2017-04-19 21:23:33 UTC] lioncock: they arent good reviewers to begin with
[2017-04-19 21:23:41 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I'm showing that there is in fact an embargo and Atlus is in fact having it enforced
[2017-04-19 21:23:42 UTC] moor888: hahahha gto dat ass banned
[2017-04-19 21:23:49 UTC] omegabusta: That guy is literally streaming right now
[2017-04-19 21:23:53 UTC] agentmainez: 32 coins out of 190
[2017-04-19 21:23:53 UTC] omegabusta: so much for being banned
[2017-04-19 21:24:01 UTC] lioncock: was it suspension
[2017-04-19 21:24:02 UTC] allaspappa2: Why did he get banned? WutFace
[2017-04-19 21:24:03 UTC] bethebaby: @bigestdspfan Well sure, but the average gamer who buys the game and then gos on Metacritic to offer a review isn't going to let the embargo factor into that review because it doesn't affect them. It has nothing to do with anyone but streamers/Youtubers. Period.
[2017-04-19 21:24:04 UTC] betheboom: the doctor will take good care of bethebaby dont be scared if he does experiments on you heh heh
[2017-04-19 21:24:09 UTC] phoenixrising2015: He was playing on 7/7
[2017-04-19 21:24:18 UTC] moor888: got dat ass banned

[2017-04-19 21:24:39 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The only people I've seen who haven't gotten the suspension are people with tons of subs
[2017-04-19 21:24:39 UTC] moor888: spoil
[2017-04-19 21:24:42 UTC] lioncock: the embargo would be an easier pill to swallow for streamers if atlus gave a deadline as to whenit ends
[2017-04-19 21:24:44 UTC] bigestdspfan: @bethebaby fans will and should
[2017-04-19 21:24:44 UTC] fa11enh3ro: hi5TFU
[2017-04-19 21:24:46 UTC] allaspappa2: @Popsicolo Why did Bahroo get banned?
[2017-04-19 21:24:55 UTC] moor888: cause he was spoling the game
[2017-04-19 21:25:00 UTC] popsicolo: Atlus has an embargo from 7/7 onward.
[2017-04-19 21:25:02 UTC] howlinthedeep: i thought you could stream 7/7 just not past that
[2017-04-19 21:25:07 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @allaspappa2, Look at the date in the Persona calender
[2017-04-19 21:25:09 UTC] bethebaby: @bigestdspfan No, they shouldn't. it's completely asinine.
[2017-04-19 21:25:14 UTC] lioncock: yeah i mean IRL date in which embargo is lifted
[2017-04-19 21:25:16 UTC] moor888: atlus do not want their game to be spoiled
[2017-04-19 21:25:24 UTC] moor888: they ban your ass quick
[2017-04-19 21:25:31 UTC] bradleymason1993: for anyone not aware, the bahroo 7/ suppossed ban was him being a troll, it wasn't real
[2017-04-19 21:25:32 UTC] agentmainez: oh god
[2017-04-19 21:25:37 UTC] bigestdspfan: @bethebaby yea well their bad that they dont enforce THAT
[2017-04-19 21:25:38 UTC] encelor: atlus is doing a LTG
