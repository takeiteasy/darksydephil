[2017-04-11 03:24:23 UTC] x1xnoblex1x: What are you talking about phill? This is game of the year material Kappa
[2017-04-11 03:24:31 UTC] xeranarth: This is BioWare. Fixing things ain't their motto.

[2017-04-11 03:25:39 UTC] andreii1984: Gravity Rush
[2017-04-11 03:25:41 UTC] xeranarth: Even the FF12 HD is gonna topple this game, in my opinion. Though admittedly I love that game.
[2017-04-11 03:25:41 UTC] blacknyellow9: Horizon is worse than ME:A
[2017-04-11 03:25:43 UTC] yacherdy: true this game isn't as good as some recent games
[2017-04-11 03:25:43 UTC] howlinthedeep: Did something happen this stream?
[2017-04-11 03:25:46 UTC] multistrong9999: Resident 7 is Pure Trash!
[2017-04-11 03:25:54 UTC] yacherdy: @HowlintheDeep Phil not having the best time with it
[2017-04-11 03:25:56 UTC] lioncock: I want to try Nier and RE7 but havent got the chance yet
[2017-04-11 03:25:58 UTC] tourwithme: RE7 is too short
[2017-04-11 03:26:01 UTC] vendatus: HZD was average as hell other games of that genre did it better
[2017-04-11 03:26:02 UTC] mfd4419: @yacherdy love this game
[2017-04-11 03:26:03 UTC] ziibrah: blacknyellow9, lol
[2017-04-11 03:26:06 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: @multistrong9999 It's a great successor to F.E.A.R. though TBH
[2017-04-11 03:26:12 UTC] mfd4419: Best game dude
[2017-04-11 03:26:15 UTC] multistrong9999: Re7 is 3 Hour Crap Fest!
[2017-04-11 03:26:17 UTC] yacherdy: @mfd4419 No I don't...I like it but its not a great game
[2017-04-11 03:26:23 UTC] eternia_forever: some bugs and such @HowlintheDeep

[2017-04-11 03:26:59 UTC] yacherdy: Well that's just your opinion
[2017-04-11 03:27:00 UTC] multistrong9999: yeah Horizon is boring p.o.g. =)
[2017-04-11 03:27:02 UTC] coralguy: I enjoyed it as well
[2017-04-11 03:27:03 UTC] lioncock: people will say its not good because they likely enjoy Zelda more but why not like both for what they are
[2017-04-11 03:27:04 UTC] howlinthedeep: cheer200 lots of padded driving in this game
[2017-04-11 03:27:15 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @DarksydePhil I would rather be stuck with the Baker's in RE7 then to ride the Nomad :D
[2017-04-11 03:27:15 UTC] codenameone: The maximum this game deserves is a 6/10
[2017-04-11 03:27:16 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: good god girl, please gargle she sounds like she a frog in her throat

[2017-04-11 03:27:46 UTC] codenameone: @YaCherdy No. This game is indefensible crap.
[2017-04-11 03:27:55 UTC] lioncock: i dont have switch or wii u sadly
[2017-04-11 03:27:57 UTC] yacherdy: @CodenameOne SeemsGood

[2017-04-11 03:28:22 UTC] 1shenron: It's enjoyable for me but then again I'm easily pleased most of the time but imo a 6/10
[2017-04-11 03:28:24 UTC] imaidenr: if i could travel across the galaxy i would try to fuck every hot alien chick there is Kreygasm
[2017-04-11 03:28:30 UTC] yacherdy: nomad looks pretty cool
[2017-04-11 03:28:33 UTC] vendatus: Phil you can fast travel to forward stations SeemsGood
[2017-04-11 03:28:33 UTC] thepastryarchy: 7/10 for me
[2017-04-11 03:28:39 UTC] jayrock87: the open world in this game looks dead
[2017-04-11 03:28:45 UTC] eternia_forever: sure does @YaCherdy
[2017-04-11 03:28:45 UTC] codenameone: What the Hell? Nice freeze
[2017-04-11 03:28:46 UTC] mfd4419: 10/10
[2017-04-11 03:28:49 UTC] 1shenron: Slightly above average game
[2017-04-11 03:28:52 UTC] mfd4419: The best game
[2017-04-11 03:28:53 UTC] multistrong9999: Sudoku is Shit in this game!
[2017-04-11 03:28:58 UTC] tactical_twitch: if i was anlien i would have 10 hundred dicks around me and fuckin all duh aliens at the same time
[2017-04-11 03:29:00 UTC] doctorzzz: well if you had explored you would have a fast travel point
[2017-04-11 03:29:00 UTC] mfd4419: Of the year
[2017-04-11 03:29:05 UTC] blazingfrost12: DarksydePhil you wouldnt need to drive so much if you bothered to get the Fast Travel points
[2017-04-11 03:29:07 UTC] codenameone: I hope Phil just rails against this game in his review.
[2017-04-11 03:29:08 UTC] cinsolace92: failed no mans sky 2
[2017-04-11 03:29:14 UTC] cnkxx: When you have like 5 other games that are the same price and are much better than this game, it's obvious that people are going to be more critical. People want to spend their hard earned money on the best of the best, just MEDIOCRE isn't enough anymore.
[2017-04-11 03:29:19 UTC] 0megaj0ker: don't die from dodging Kappa
[2017-04-11 03:29:24 UTC] imaidenr: @mfd4419, better than horizon zero dawn ha? Kappa
[2017-04-11 03:29:27 UTC] 1shenron: But I'd rather preferred A remastered ME:Trilogy with possibly adding content cut out from the original games
[2017-04-11 03:29:37 UTC] mfd4419: Both shit games

[2017-04-11 03:30:45 UTC] imaidenr: @Darksydephil, Horizon Zero Dawn was an awesome game. Do you agree?
[2017-04-11 03:30:46 UTC] nolbert87: cheer300 I'm sure you've heard this all day but congrats on the engagement.
[2017-04-11 03:30:50 UTC] nukacolaking: I sense a game bug incoming.... justa hunch
[2017-04-11 03:30:56 UTC] nolbert87: cheer300 and fuck this game it gets worse every stream I come to!

[2017-04-11 03:31:52 UTC] howlinthedeep: Yeah just do the story and finish the game
[2017-04-11 03:31:57 UTC] blazingfrost12: DarksydePhil what about Jaal
[2017-04-11 03:31:57 UTC] nolbert87: @eternia_forever oh good I was hoping.
[2017-04-11 03:32:00 UTC] imaidenr: @mfd4419, i hope you are joking :D

[2017-04-11 03:32:36 UTC] cm0n3ymillionair: the other mass effect games were so fun when they came out
[2017-04-11 03:32:40 UTC] tactical_twitch: it's not salt when pretty much every competent person agrees it's shit
[2017-04-11 03:32:45 UTC] andreii1984: no driving in Havarl
[2017-04-11 03:32:53 UTC] yacherdy: @Tactical_Twitch Nice condescension
[2017-04-11 03:32:55 UTC] lioncock: he is raging hard but the game is also bad, its a combo tbh
[2017-04-11 03:32:58 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: @cm0n3ymillionair I actually liked the driving in ME1... but I played it on PC so the controls were a lot better lol
[2017-04-11 03:32:58 UTC] bentboxer: does it take this long to find a settlement for your people
[2017-04-11 03:33:13 UTC] multistrong9999: this game is MasterPiece :D :D :D
[2017-04-11 03:33:16 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @kevindeleonisscum same here, I got the game on PC
[2017-04-11 03:33:19 UTC] sicko: cheer15
[2017-04-11 03:33:32 UTC] lioncock: like the fact taht the first three were as fun as they were really stings me when i watch this
[2017-04-11 03:33:36 UTC] cm0n3ymillionair: @kevindeleonisscum i feel u man
[2017-04-11 03:33:46 UTC] yacherdy: Shit game; but still plays it
[2017-04-11 03:33:48 UTC] yacherdy: hmmmm
[2017-04-11 03:33:49 UTC] andreii1984: enjoy walking

[2017-04-11 03:33:56 UTC] mfd4419: This game is not so bad really :D
[2017-04-11 03:34:01 UTC] yacherdy: @Tactical_Twitch who was?
[2017-04-11 03:34:12 UTC] tactical_twitch: Vendatus
[2017-04-11 03:34:15 UTC] codenameone: @YaCherdy You know why he still plays it.
[2017-04-11 03:34:20 UTC] coralguy: Man bear pig resides here
[2017-04-11 03:34:28 UTC] lioncock: ive watched other more competent gamers on twitch play this and it wasnt an improvement
[2017-04-11 03:34:31 UTC] yacherdy: @Tactical_Twitch I don't recall him being a jerk but maybe I missed it.
[2017-04-11 03:34:37 UTC] bentboxer: al gore lives here

[2017-04-11 03:34:52 UTC] vendatus: How was I a jerk? WutFace
[2017-04-11 03:35:04 UTC] blacknyellow9: In my opinion the problem with this playthrough is that Phil hasn't been into it from day 1. He took no time into looking into any additional dialogue, skiped half of the content up till this point
[2017-04-11 03:35:09 UTC] andreii1984: have you done "Movie Night" quest its very important, lol
[2017-04-11 03:35:10 UTC] 0megaj0ker: It would be funny if Phil discovers the "Duck Walk" feature :D
[2017-04-11 03:35:14 UTC] tactical_twitch: saying babyrage and salt when people dont like a crap game
[2017-04-11 03:35:17 UTC] doctorzzz: he shouldnt even review it he skipped like 50% of the game
[2017-04-11 03:35:26 UTC] bentboxer: when do you get to conquer the andromeda galaxy
[2017-04-11 03:35:28 UTC] lioncock: 1 v 1 me on yooka laylee local multiplayer minigames ill smash u m8s
[2017-04-11 03:35:40 UTC] yacherdy: well it's okay if you don't like it @Tactical_Twitch
[2017-04-11 03:35:42 UTC] howlinthedeep: No he took time in the start blacknyellow9 and then eventually he went to fuck it i don't care anymore mode
[2017-04-11 03:35:47 UTC] doctorzzz: he obv has no intererest in playung it anymore so he should just stop and do more persona
[2017-04-11 03:35:50 UTC] codenameone: At this point a game crash would be the cherry on top.
[2017-04-11 03:35:50 UTC] yacherdy: I respect that
[2017-04-11 03:35:51 UTC] andreii1984: Phil, you going to play horde mode multiplayer?
[2017-04-11 03:35:55 UTC] yacherdy: but be open minded

[2017-04-11 03:36:18 UTC] blacknyellow9: @HowlintheDeep i guess but he took time for like the first gameplay session and that was it lol
[2017-04-11 03:36:28 UTC] codenameone: @YaCherdy Dude we've *been* open minded. It's just not good.
[2017-04-11 03:36:30 UTC] lioncock: yooka laylee aint perfect but i enjoyed it a lot more than i ever did mn9
[2017-04-11 03:36:35 UTC] doctorzzz: why is he doing a random sidequest
[2017-04-11 03:36:37 UTC] yacherdy: @Tactical_Twitch calling people who like this game not competent is kind of harsh
[2017-04-11 03:36:46 UTC] mfd4419: This game is so good duuuude
[2017-04-11 03:36:47 UTC] lioncock: he was referring to phil not being competent
[2017-04-11 03:36:54 UTC] yacherdy: @CodenameOne That's fine I respect that...most people in the chat hate it
[2017-04-11 03:36:56 UTC] lioncock: which he himself admits when its true
[2017-04-11 03:37:00 UTC] tactical_twitch: I said "pretty much every competent gamer"

[2017-04-11 17:49:55 UTC] betheboom: yesterday i cant explain the glitches of mass effect but the driving was because phil was using 4 WHEEL drive going uphill which doesnt work
[2017-04-11 17:50:13 UTC] betheboom: i never had driving issues or glitches
[2017-04-11 17:50:41 UTC] howlinthedeep: hahaha yeah he used 4 and 6 wheels at all the wrong time
[2017-04-11 17:51:13 UTC] betheboom: deep exactly and he goes on a rant at how bad the game is because of the driving THAT IS ONE THING
[2017-04-11 17:51:22 UTC] betheboom: and phil couldnt get it right
[2017-04-11 17:52:02 UTC] betheboom: glitches i cant defend other than saying i got lucky for not having any

[2017-04-11 17:52:40 UTC] howlinthedeep: yeah there were some bad glitches...shouldn't have been in the game but only took a couple minutes to get back to there
[2017-04-11 17:53:00 UTC] howlinthedeep: It was actually funny to watch him rage at the game
[2017-04-11 17:53:32 UTC] betheboom: deep he was in a middle of a fight and he started talking to someone that was his fault
[2017-04-11 17:53:57 UTC] betheboom: now the death was his fault the glitch wasnt
[2017-04-11 17:54:03 UTC] howlinthedeep: oh i remember that :D the game shouldn't have let him do that but I'm sure he was trying to get into a glitch

[2017-04-11 18:14:08 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn that was quick
[2017-04-11 18:14:11 UTC] darksydephil: apparently the actual story o fhte game is short as hell
[2017-04-11 18:14:17 UTC] darksydephil: its just the tons of side content that make it long
[2017-04-11 18:14:19 UTC] betheboom: phil yep you are you got the the journey to meridian and meridian itself and your done

[2017-04-11 18:15:45 UTC] chikilucario: I'm glad I can be here at white LowTierGod's stream, hey Phil can I take Leanne to prom? I just wanted to ask you first
[2017-04-11 18:15:48 UTC] jaxunhero: Hey Phil!

[2017-04-11 18:16:12 UTC] anondublo1: Who intentionally chooses to listen to Destiny though? Like why?
[2017-04-11 18:16:27 UTC] betheboom: phil look forward to the MULTIPLAYER of mass effect andromeda :D
[2017-04-11 18:16:29 UTC] lunaequalsluna: @theycallmejimbob just bought it :D

[2017-04-11 18:16:58 UTC] danielsvenson1: does tee spring have boxer shorts?
[2017-04-11 18:17:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah sweet LunaEqualsLuna hope the port is good
[2017-04-11 18:17:09 UTC] darksydephil: stream working for everyone?
[2017-04-11 18:17:10 UTC] lunaequalsluna: @theycallmejimbob lack of 60fps on xbox360 was a killer :(
[2017-04-11 18:17:10 UTC] vezvor: I simply am not buying this game, for the simple fact that Playtonic are a bunch of assholes for taking JonTron out of the game. Fuck you Playtonic
[2017-04-11 18:17:14 UTC] howlinthedeep: yep phil
[2017-04-11 18:17:17 UTC] anondublo1: Oh I'm talking about some *** streamer, not the game.
[2017-04-11 18:17:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yup Phil
[2017-04-11 18:17:18 UTC] edicus: Yep working well
[2017-04-11 18:17:24 UTC] anondublo1: They both suck dick though.
[2017-04-11 18:17:25 UTC] danielsvenson1: jontron is an asshole
[2017-04-11 18:17:26 UTC] betheboom: yep phil
[2017-04-11 18:17:29 UTC] darksydephil: ok cool,l ill tweet that we're live

[2017-04-11 18:17:37 UTC] bbt_2017: Kappa
[2017-04-11 18:17:38 UTC] jaxunhero: Heard this game after its patch doesn't lose frames anymore. It's runs a solid 1080 30FP iirc
[2017-04-11 18:17:38 UTC] danielsvenson1: jontron is a racist
[2017-04-11 18:17:41 UTC] unquietmist: What happened with Johntron?
[2017-04-11 18:17:47 UTC] theycallmejimbob: they say cutscenes are in 30fps LunaEqualsLuna if that matters to you
[2017-04-11 18:17:48 UTC] darksydephil: for the record, i really dont know who jontron is nor do i care, therefore the "controversy" around this game is null and void for me, a non-issue
[2017-04-11 18:17:49 UTC] mfd4419: Bethe
[2017-04-11 18:17:52 UTC] mfd4419: Hi
[2017-04-11 18:18:01 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Oh don't bring up jontron - that's toxic on a whole new level
[2017-04-11 18:18:18 UTC] lunaequalsluna: @theycallmejimbob 30fps is more cinematic KappaHD
[2017-04-11 18:18:24 UTC] danielsvenson1: nphil it had nothing to do with game just jontron's racist comments on a video
[2017-04-11 18:18:42 UTC] darthvidarviking: who cares about the political views of a let's player anyways. Eh darksyde?
[2017-04-11 18:18:43 UTC] vezvor: JonTron is the Stanley Kubrick of YouTube

[2017-04-11 18:20:05 UTC] darthvidarviking: that is right. I don't care if people are literary hitler as long as they are funny
[2017-04-11 18:20:08 UTC] anondublo1: Shit, more than boycott. They're willing to get random motherfuckers fired from their jobs IRL over comments made online.

[2017-04-11 18:21:50 UTC] hapticbabyman: so over this Jontron thing already. He added nothing significant to the game. He brought the entire situation upon himself, let him deal with it like an adult. Yooka-Laylee is bigger than him.
[2017-04-11 18:21:51 UTC] darksydephil: YouTubers and let's players need to realize they're not political figureheads who need to stand on a soapbox spouting shit. they're not any more important than anyone else. and they'd best do well to learn that or else they'll all end up like jontron

[2017-04-11 18:22:28 UTC] zahvone: Well, here's the thing about politics and this generation - it's so hard for people to respect other opinions that don't align with theirs anymore.
[2017-04-11 18:22:29 UTC] mfd4419: 💨
[2017-04-11 18:22:34 UTC] gnomusy: Once politicians are elected they all become puppets, played by the same as before.

[2017-04-11 18:22:40 UTC] betheboom: ufccurpstomp im trying man
[2017-04-11 18:22:42 UTC] codenameone: Only Youtube gamer I ever knew who could actually talk politics and not trigger people was LeftyOX. And he's gone now.

[2017-04-11 18:22:59 UTC] danielsvenson1: christ jontron must have really fucked up
[2017-04-11 18:23:00 UTC] alexharveyconrad: It's also common to be immersed in politics at a very young age, which is sad.
[2017-04-11 18:23:00 UTC] darksydephil: because rational thought is based on intake of many different perspective and opinions
[2017-04-11 18:23:08 UTC] darksydephil: you can't figure out something without seeing it from different angles
[2017-04-11 18:23:13 UTC] mfd4419: Pewdepie is good

[2017-04-11 18:23:21 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Zahvone tbf JonTron's "opinions" aren't respectable at the least. The the way he came to them.
[2017-04-11 18:23:22 UTC] zahvone: It's awful. It's a basic human moral and people seem to forget how to see things from different perspectives. Everyone has a one track mind these days.
[2017-04-11 18:23:27 UTC] twistedmetalkane: hey dweeb
[2017-04-11 18:23:29 UTC] coralguy: Ignant
[2017-04-11 18:23:31 UTC] anondublo1: @Zahvone They deem your opinions unacceptable right out the gate. You have to agree with them or you're wrong. They'll ban you from even speaking, so there is no room for debate in the first place.
[2017-04-11 18:23:31 UTC] danielsvenson1: phil's id say ur a mix of conservative and liberal cause u hate taxes and stuff
[2017-04-11 18:23:39 UTC] twistedmetalkane: how are you today
[2017-04-11 18:23:39 UTC] bbt_2017: it's ok for you tubers to share political opinions though. Can't avoid consequences if they have bad/evil ones though
[2017-04-11 18:23:48 UTC] zahvone: @anondublo1 Exactly. It's so sad. :(
[2017-04-11 18:23:49 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: someone who gives them an ideal to strive towards.
[2017-04-11 18:23:49 UTC] hapticbabyman: But in general, yes, people go to their own bubbles when it comes to politics and that's why it's toxic to talk about it

[2017-04-11 20:40:25 UTC] insanekyo: Neogaf is not really a single entity, it's just a message forum
[2017-04-11 20:40:27 UTC] preciseradish: I want to see him finish Crysis 3 :(
[2017-04-11 20:40:28 UTC] lioncock: thanks for being mature

[2017-04-11 20:41:11 UTC] gamerofallpcgames: I'm just wondering how they manage to use songs from banjo sound so similar it's crazy
[2017-04-11 20:41:11 UTC] lioncock: not the sole reason, i agree
[2017-04-11 20:41:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil seems to be enjoying this game so far

[2017-04-11 20:41:46 UTC] lioncock: i surely hope youre right, because i also saw them get on David Jaffe's case after Drawn to Death and that triggered me too

[2017-04-11 20:42:34 UTC] stuart360: Of course they arehn't mentioning jontron, they want to make the review look as 'genuine' as possible
[2017-04-11 20:42:35 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Amy who?
[2017-04-11 20:42:42 UTC] bradleymason1993: Th-th-th-tha-tha-tha-that's all, folks! lol
[2017-04-11 20:42:44 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob oh sure
[2017-04-11 20:42:45 UTC] hapticbabyman: Just b/c GAF messed up on one thing doesn't mean they're the reason behind another thing (like what happened w/ this game). That's assuming too much.
[2017-04-11 20:42:45 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Oh

[2017-04-11 20:43:11 UTC] stuart360: Neogaf users in the chat?
[2017-04-11 20:43:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Still Amy is cute
[2017-04-11 20:43:14 UTC] betheboom: its no use
[2017-04-11 20:43:18 UTC] gamerofallpcgames: i wonder if they have a beach level like banjo in this game
[2017-04-11 20:43:21 UTC] phoenixrising2015: but I can't stand her comedy or most of her hype
[2017-04-11 20:43:22 UTC] lioncock: like i said i agree, but i feel they are still not good for the business when they beliieve they are. And yeah youre correct about Neo losing their relevancy
[2017-04-11 20:43:25 UTC] derichloveslemur: @theycallmejimbob liking this game?
[2017-04-11 20:43:27 UTC] lioncock: i hope they lose even more
[2017-04-11 20:43:27 UTC] yacherdy: If I have a choice between Amy Schumer and Cara Delavingne I'm picking Car

[2017-04-11 20:43:49 UTC] stuart360: Giving scathing reviews after 10mins of play, you don't need to be a rocket science to understand whats going on
[2017-04-11 20:43:50 UTC] betheboom: cara Kreygasm
[2017-04-11 20:43:55 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, Can you do your best bugs bunny impression I always love your impressions

[2017-04-11 20:44:07 UTC] bammbino: this game is making me want another pikmin game for phil to play
[2017-04-11 20:44:08 UTC] betheboom: pheonix does amy?
[2017-04-11 20:44:10 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Cara may be like "Can we?"
[2017-04-11 20:44:13 UTC] thekingofcrybabys2hd: Why are people obsessed with that chick?
[2017-04-11 20:44:17 UTC] megamannt125: Maybe he means the monster village?
[2017-04-11 20:44:18 UTC] yacherdy: you're a amy fan bethe?
[2017-04-11 20:44:20 UTC] insanekyo: Not gonna lie this game isn't my cup of tea, when's persona? :(
[2017-04-11 20:44:24 UTC] vendatus: Cara WutFace terrible actress Kappa
[2017-04-11 20:44:24 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Lioncock They will at the rate they're going. Leaks don't even originate there anymore; usually Reddit and 4chan
[2017-04-11 20:44:26 UTC] betheboom: cherdy just asking
[2017-04-11 20:44:32 UTC] kushiyakitori: @Insanekyo, I think it has a chance of being voted in for tomorrow

[2017-04-11 20:44:44 UTC] yacherdy: for research bethe?
[2017-04-11 20:44:44 UTC] lioncock: reddit gets some flack but if you find the right community they can have unbiased discussion
[2017-04-11 20:44:45 UTC] derichloveslemur: Best Bugs Bunny impression?
[2017-04-11 20:44:50 UTC] betheboom: cherdy yes

[2017-04-11 20:45:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: archaic game design
[2017-04-11 20:45:30 UTC] anondublo1: I think upvotes/downvotes take too much away from any actual discussion
[2017-04-11 20:45:34 UTC] hapticbabyman: Yes Reddit is good I don't get the hate for them by GAF. I don't browse 4chan but if leaks are there I might give it a look.
[2017-04-11 20:45:34 UTC] dagowhopper: @Insanekyo, gamefaqs is awful in general
[2017-04-11 20:45:37 UTC] phoenixrising2015: *drops head*

[2017-04-11 20:45:53 UTC] lioncock: yeah some reddits get real bad about downvoting dissenting opinion, you have to find the good communities within

[2017-04-11 20:46:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Gamefaqs gave use GamefaqsAkuma, GamefaqsDante, and GamefaqsHulk
[2017-04-11 20:46:10 UTC] phoenixrising2015: All from MvC3's board
[2017-04-11 20:46:12 UTC] stuart360: Yeah people said it was pretty hard. I was expecting Phil rage

[2017-04-11 21:12:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Dean Ambrose
[2017-04-11 21:12:57 UTC] phoenixrising2015: They never gave him a proper push besides the world title run
[2017-04-11 21:13:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Totally ruined the Seth feud
[2017-04-11 21:13:07 UTC] lioncock: is he not IC champ still?
[2017-04-11 21:13:10 UTC] phoenixrising2015: He is
[2017-04-11 21:13:15 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015 Ambrose is back on RAW
[2017-04-11 21:13:21 UTC] lioncock: i like that theyre using the old designs for IC belt
[2017-04-11 21:13:23 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But they treat him like a midcarder
[2017-04-11 21:13:33 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I know he beat up the Miz
[2017-04-11 21:13:36 UTC] lioncock: I wish the midcard titles were as important as they were in the olden days
[2017-04-11 21:13:42 UTC] phoenixrising2015: That dude was hardcore in CZW
[2017-04-11 21:13:49 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015 Would you want a shield Reunion?
[2017-04-11 21:13:52 UTC] thekingofcrybabys2hd: Biggest problem with talent in wwe is that there is no personality
[2017-04-11 21:13:53 UTC] lioncock: like European Title and IC title in its heyday were cool
[2017-04-11 21:13:54 UTC] phoenixrising2015: That would be cool
[2017-04-11 21:13:57 UTC] lioncock: had their own feuds and storylines
[2017-04-11 21:14:22 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015 My favorite Wrestler is Cesaro
[2017-04-11 21:14:32 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Dean Ambrose as Jon Moxley is just Dean Ambrose but completely and utterly prepared to stab you
[2017-04-11 21:14:40 UTC] lioncock: i feel tag team divisions dont get proper respects anymore either
[2017-04-11 21:14:42 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Cesaro is super athletic
[2017-04-11 21:15:00 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015 Cesaro is awesome. He was awesome as Claudio Castagnoli
[2017-04-11 21:15:10 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I saw a spot that made me almost scream
[2017-04-11 21:15:21 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Dean as Jon Moxley took a drill saw to the forehead
[2017-04-11 21:15:36 UTC] lioncock: jon moxley promos were the best
[2017-04-11 21:15:41 UTC] mk4eva: @Derichloveslemur lol you know they did that on purpose so they can have the shield again
[2017-04-11 21:15:43 UTC] lioncock: no filter
[2017-04-11 21:15:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: then someone linked me a video of him talking about it and the thing was actually so soft the guy who used it on him put it on his tongue
[2017-04-11 21:15:50 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015 and he survived?
[2017-04-11 21:16:08 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Mk4Eva Oh I never knew that thx!
[2017-04-11 21:16:34 UTC] lioncock: I remember Ambrose was supposed to have a big feud with mick foley but he got all weird and preachy because Dean mentioned his son's name or something
[2017-04-11 21:16:41 UTC] lioncock: and the angle was cancelled
[2017-04-11 21:16:49 UTC] lioncock: this was when he was still in NXT
[2017-04-11 21:17:08 UTC] derichloveslemur: Dean Ambrose and Mick Foley lol
[2017-04-11 21:17:15 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @Derichloveslemur, Yeah I freaked out. Someone showed me a link where he talks about it, and brings up people who said it was real and said "I WOULD HAVE DIED IF IT WAS REAL DO YOU THINK I WOULD DO THAT" and how the saw was actually so soft his opponent put it on his tongue and it did nothing. It was like baby skin soft
[2017-04-11 21:17:28 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I legit breathed a sigh of relief hearing that
[2017-04-11 21:17:30 UTC] lioncock: the promos for it would have been good, not gonna say the match itself would be that great unless it was hardcore
[2017-04-11 21:17:38 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015 Wow someone surviving a drill
[2017-04-11 21:18:32 UTC] bradleymason1993: this music is starting to get really fucking annoying lol
[2017-04-11 21:18:35 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @Derichloveslemur, Yeah but the drill was a gimmick. Like he said when the guy showed it to him planning the match he was like "What is that?" and the guy said "No wait look" and put it on his own tongue and it just massaged his tongue. The drill was fake and was like a sponge or something
[2017-04-11 21:18:50 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I heard that and was like "*sighs heavily*
[2017-04-11 21:19:01 UTC] mk4eva: Vince : GOD DFAMNIT THE FANS ARE STILL BITCHING BOUT MY ROMAN. THEN THE SHIELD MUST BE RESURRECTED!! THE FANS WILL STOP BITCHING AND BOOING

[2017-04-11 21:19:24 UTC] splitplaythru: We wont be able to help him since you can't pause the game.
[2017-04-11 21:19:28 UTC] mk4eva: goosfraba
[2017-04-11 21:19:36 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You wrestling fans want to notice something? Look up Jon Moxley's CZW theme, then listen to Dean Ambrose's WWE theme
[2017-04-11 21:19:42 UTC] splitplaythru: 10 seconds to answer a question...
[2017-04-11 21:19:59 UTC] lioncock: they make you answer as to many hours youve played the game
[2017-04-11 21:20:06 UTC] lioncock: thats a tricky move
[2017-04-11 21:20:10 UTC] splitplaythru: with some luck he can make it to first quiz today
[2017-04-11 21:20:24 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015 I wonder what RAW Superstars are coming to SmackDown LIVE
[2017-04-11 21:20:33 UTC] splitplaythru: i had some easy questions on 3rd quiz, Lion
[2017-04-11 21:20:36 UTC] splitplaythru: boy was i happy
[2017-04-11 21:20:49 UTC] splitplaythru: like what is first move Trowzers teaches you
[2017-04-11 21:21:07 UTC] splitplaythru: and what does Invisibility do
[2017-04-11 21:21:30 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Charlotte I heard is apparently moving
[2017-04-11 21:21:30 UTC] splitplaythru: then i got the tripup in how many quills total I have, and total amount of hours played
[2017-04-11 21:21:36 UTC] phoenixrising2015: After that botch fest with Nia
[2017-04-11 21:22:08 UTC] lioncock: Is amazing kong retired or does WWE not want her?
[2017-04-11 21:22:29 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I dom

[2017-04-11 21:23:07 UTC] derichloveslemur: oh gotcha
[2017-04-11 21:23:10 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Apparently AJ was going to Raw but he didn't so I can't say I know everything
[2017-04-11 21:23:29 UTC] lioncock: they always do last min changes to trick the dirtsheet readers
[2017-04-11 21:23:30 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Lioncock Amazing Kong is Kharma right?

[2017-04-11 21:34:05 UTC] lioncock: probably not, but VF is one of the most technical fighters out there

[2017-04-11 21:34:12 UTC] lioncock: it was fun trying to get good at it

[2017-04-11 21:34:55 UTC] betheboom: i do prefer controllers for fighting games i only use stick at arcades lol
[2017-04-11 21:35:00 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Lioncock VF is very underrated in the West sadly. Maybe a VF x DOA crossover would help give it a profile boost.
[2017-04-11 21:35:09 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey @hapticbabyman
[2017-04-11 21:35:21 UTC] splitplaythru: 2 GBP are around 3 USD

[2017-04-11 21:35:34 UTC] hapticbabyman: Hey there @Derichloveslemur
[2017-04-11 21:35:44 UTC] lioncock: i remember the top VF player (forget his name) was able to win a Street Fighter tourny at EVO one year, that was impressive
[2017-04-11 21:35:47 UTC] yacherdy: I felt like a big man
[2017-04-11 21:35:51 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil how do you go into 1st person again?
[2017-04-11 21:36:02 UTC] hoshihearts: that delay
[2017-04-11 21:36:08 UTC] yacherdy: I was gonna let him win but I didn't have it in me to lose to a 10 year old

[2017-04-11 21:36:33 UTC] encephalolz: This game looks smooth af.
[2017-04-11 21:36:49 UTC] lioncock: go watch his ME playthrough from yesterday, he raged hard at it
[2017-04-11 21:36:50 UTC] lioncock: it was funny
[2017-04-11 21:36:54 UTC] sh00s: yeah this game looks fun of you are a child or blazed out of your mind
[2017-04-11 21:36:59 UTC] hapticbabyman: Not surprised; if you're good at VF you'll probably be at least decently good at any other fighting game.
[2017-04-11 21:37:01 UTC] derichloveslemur: So L3 @DarksydePhil for 1st person?
[2017-04-11 21:37:05 UTC] bobbi_ling: RalpherZ panicBasket this is fine

[2017-04-11 21:37:51 UTC] lioncock: bugs and general dissapointment
[2017-04-11 21:37:55 UTC] lioncock: oh yeah the driving too lmao
[2017-04-11 21:38:03 UTC] betheboom: cherdy i always feel bad when i am 1-0 up against someone in a fighting game that i hold back on defeating them then i lose, another reason i dont go online often in fighting games...i show too much mercy
[2017-04-11 21:38:12 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil Its like a gumball tree
[2017-04-11 21:38:19 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: why is there ammo if you can get it back everywhere anytime you want?
[2017-04-11 21:38:25 UTC] yacherdy: @betheboom same bethe I don't have a competitor's spirit...I feel bad if I win :D
[2017-04-11 21:38:27 UTC] stuart360: Phil would rage about having to drive in a Need For Speed game
[2017-04-11 21:38:33 UTC] yacherdy: not that I would win a lot
[2017-04-11 21:38:34 UTC] hapticbabyman: This seems like a good game for what it wants to be but I'd of liked if it were more platforming focused. At least Mario Odyssey will meet that requirement
[2017-04-11 21:38:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :D damn stuart
[2017-04-11 21:38:46 UTC] encephalolz: This character is like a baby Lizalfos from Zelda. Jebaited

[2017-04-11 21:39:17 UTC] stuart360: He actually liked NFS The Run as well, even though he raged a lot. Its a great playthrough for rage actually
[2017-04-11 21:39:25 UTC] mk4eva: i have a question about PS VR. please no trolling. i just want to know fro some peeps here who actually own one, is it really worth the price ? i was on the fence of buying it but not sure.
[2017-04-11 21:39:26 UTC] betheboom: zangief is a good street fighter char i like him

[2017-04-11 21:40:13 UTC] theycallmejimbob: there was some rage yes but it was because of poor game design
[2017-04-11 21:40:13 UTC] hapticbabyman: he def raged in Furi especially towards the end

[2017-04-11 21:41:24 UTC] butter__my__bread: Furi was a hard game but was very rewarding to beat. just a lil perseverance is all that is needed if u have any chops at all
[2017-04-11 21:41:25 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil have you ever seen a beautiful double rainbow in the sky?

[2017-04-11 23:08:42 UTC] bammbino: my stomach was hurting watching it
[2017-04-11 23:08:42 UTC] yacherdy: "worst game I've played in a long time"
[2017-04-11 23:08:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh that triggered you I bet YaCherdy
[2017-04-11 23:08:56 UTC] bammbino: "im trying so hard to not quit this game" - phil 2017
[2017-04-11 23:08:59 UTC] yacherdy: @HowlintheDeep he wants dem accumulative monies
[2017-04-11 23:09:04 UTC] darksydephil: howl, its not that man. im really appreciative that you cheered!
[2017-04-11 23:09:09 UTC] codenameone: "Look! LOOK! I'm stuck in the closet!"
[2017-04-11 23:09:21 UTC] darksydephil: but you saw what happened. others who may have jumped into the top cheer game were basically turned off by it
[2017-04-11 23:09:28 UTC] bammbino: MORE DRIVING are the best vids for it Bobbi_Ling
[2017-04-11 23:09:44 UTC] darksydephil: i think the best way to do it is to just keep going wtih the top cheer stuff and not trying to blow everyone out of the water
[2017-04-11 23:09:44 UTC] howlinthedeep: thanks I understand...yeah people can be intimidated by a huge cheer
[2017-04-11 23:09:46 UTC] stormforcegamer: Fingers crossed Man U beats Chelsea at the weekend... Sorry Bethe lol
[2017-04-11 23:09:47 UTC] allaspappa2: oh stream is ending? DansGame
[2017-04-11 23:09:53 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob Not triggered just annoyed..you can go back and look at the chat logs. I just left the stream because it wasn't a good environment to be in at the time lol I was polite and everything
[2017-04-11 23:09:54 UTC] allaspappa2: Tuned in a bit late
[2017-04-11 23:09:56 UTC] bobbi_ling: sounds good MingLee ill give it a go
[2017-04-11 23:09:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I hope so too stormforcegamer :(
[2017-04-11 23:10:21 UTC] bammbino: YaCherdy, is like a smurf, hes friendly til the villains come out
[2017-04-11 23:10:26 UTC] stuart360: You would probably of got less bits than Deeps cheer though to be fair
[2017-04-11 23:10:29 UTC] bammbino: bethebatman usually saves him
[2017-04-11 23:10:39 UTC] yacherdy: when 150 people gang up on one person who likes something its probably best to not be there with them...might say something you don't mean lol
[2017-04-11 23:10:47 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah triggered was the wrong word YaCherdy :( sorry just I know how much you love the Mass Effect games
[2017-04-11 23:10:52 UTC] yacherdy: @Bammbino hey I'm just passionate about mah vidya games lol
[2017-04-11 23:11:12 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob lol no worries i know what you mean..I'm a sensitive little guy
[2017-04-11 23:11:13 UTC] manyperegrine81: Did Phil just started streaming?
[2017-04-11 23:11:15 UTC] bammbino: np, me too! phil taught me to deal with him shitting on it or i leave
[2017-04-11 23:11:17 UTC] darksydephil: stuart maybe not. because chances are, deep was going to spend those bits anyway over time. but other people stopped cheering when they saw that bomb drop lol
[2017-04-11 23:11:39 UTC] stuart360: Fair point Phil
[2017-04-11 23:11:40 UTC] bobbi_ling: even vidar
[2017-04-11 23:11:40 UTC] yacherdy: @Bammbino true SeemsGood
[2017-04-11 23:11:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: we all get like that at times YaCherdy no worries enjoy the later stream peace HeyGuys
[2017-04-11 23:11:54 UTC] manyperegrine81: Oh okay he just ended it.

[2017-04-11 23:12:27 UTC] yacherdy: lol
[2017-04-11 23:12:49 UTC] bobbi_ling: nah persona gets my vote due to spoilers
[2017-04-11 23:12:59 UTC] bammbino: but july 7...
[2017-04-11 23:13:02 UTC] stuart360: Yeah vote for this game or Mass Effetc, give us a break from Persona lol
[2017-04-11 23:13:15 UTC] codenameone: Persona overload, man.
[2017-04-11 23:13:19 UTC] yacherdy: 7/7 MingLee
[2017-04-11 23:13:33 UTC] bammbino: calling it now, july 7 comes and people will say phil rage quit it
[2017-04-11 23:13:45 UTC] codenameone: Plus when P5 is on the poll it's *guaranteed* to win, so the poll is basically rigged.
[2017-04-11 23:13:50 UTC] manyperegrine81: Voting for Persona 5 for the lulz definitely .
[2017-04-11 23:13:53 UTC] yacherdy: rigged MingLee
[2017-04-11 23:14:21 UTC] darksydephil: well people are saying I spent $1-10k on Leanna's engagement ring when I blatantly explained on camera that it was only $200, so I'm sure people will say stupid shit about Persona as well Bammbino. They're just THAT dumb
[2017-04-11 23:14:21 UTC] bammbino: ill just be neutral and vote for this or mlb
[2017-04-11 23:14:31 UTC] manyperegrine81: Or when someone makes an "Executive" Decision lol
[2017-04-11 23:14:36 UTC] bammbino: WHAT LMFAO
[2017-04-11 23:14:47 UTC] bammbino: god these people need a reality check
[2017-04-11 23:15:11 UTC] yacherdy: well I think it's public knowledge that it was 200 not 1k
[2017-04-11 23:15:13 UTC] yacherdy: now at least
[2017-04-11 23:15:20 UTC] darksydephil: yeah they're incredibly stupid. also saying that i'm "stealing" everyone's money for a wedding and don't need it. hwen i said, ON CAMERA, we're not getting married until i'm out of the financial shithole
[2017-04-11 23:15:47 UTC] bammbino: sucks to have to be open about your personal life to only get shit on by loud haters
[2017-04-11 23:15:54 UTC] bammbino: alot of the twitter comments were nice tho!
[2017-04-11 23:15:59 UTC] stuart360: Problem with the trolls is that they make something up and then it instantly becomes 'fact' and something to use against you Phil. Your fans know how it is though
[2017-04-11 23:16:16 UTC] yacherdy: most twitter and instagram comments were kind
[2017-04-11 23:16:33 UTC] bammbino: yea stuart360 in all honesty, i thought phil married her a long time ago and it never affected me
[2017-04-11 23:16:34 UTC] manyperegrine81: You do realizes Phil that you are only giving your trolls for more ammunition. Why not quit talking about your personal life so much?
[2017-04-11 23:16:39 UTC] darksydephil: yes most people were very supportive so that was nice
[2017-04-11 23:16:46 UTC] bammbino: to see people mad about him getting engaged seems off
[2017-04-11 23:17:19 UTC] darksydephil: the entire SOK podcast this week will probably be wild, rampant, insulting speculation about he engagaement
[2017-04-11 23:17:25 UTC] darksydephil: thats all they fucking do anyway lol
[2017-04-11 23:17:25 UTC] stuart360: Bammbino well imo Phil should keep stuff like this to himself. Only because its going to get twisted by the trolls. The less stuff they know about Phils life the better imo
[2017-04-11 23:17:50 UTC] bammbino: phil cant keep this to himself, what friends does he have in this day and age? its us
[2017-04-11 23:17:56 UTC] bammbino: he was happy and shared it
[2017-04-11 23:18:06 UTC] bammbino: working 6 days a week = no friends
[2017-04-11 23:18:14 UTC] bammbino: no matter what career you take
[2017-04-11 23:18:23 UTC] expicell: @DarksydePhil the SOK are speculating that leanna is pregnant
[2017-04-11 23:18:24 UTC] darksydephil: bammbino is pretty much right
[2017-04-11 23:18:35 UTC] darksydephil: when i started doing YT full time i sacrificed a ton of stuff
[2017-04-11 23:18:36 UTC] codenameone: @DarksydePhil I doubt that. Don't get me wrong, there are people in the detractor community who talked shit, but even the SOK will probably just say "congrats" and move on.
[2017-04-11 23:18:51 UTC] bammbino: he may call us idiots from time to time out of frustration, but we're really all he has other than leanna
[2017-04-11 23:19:07 UTC] yacherdy: lol
[2017-04-11 23:19:10 UTC] stuart360: Yeah i understand that Phil and Bammbino, its just i have had exchanges with the trolls many times ovver the years, and i know the kind of stuff they twist
[2017-04-11 23:19:13 UTC] bammbino: @YaCherdy, yes you! lol
[2017-04-11 23:19:20 UTC] yacherdy: I know MingLee
[2017-04-11 23:19:45 UTC] expicell: @stuart360 you do know that Fred Fuchs from SOK donates to phil's paterion about $20 a month right?
[2017-04-11 23:19:54 UTC] bammbino: i dont know the trolls and i dont watch them either, im so thankful i havent given them any attention
[2017-04-11 23:20:09 UTC] bammbino: i only know them from the vlog mentions
[2017-04-11 23:20:17 UTC] manyperegrine81: @stuart360 Exactly, if only he ever goes back to the real world, get a part time or two and still do YouTube to the side. That's Personal Responsibility.
[2017-04-11 23:20:32 UTC] bammbino: @ManyPeregrine81, he cant do youtube thats the issue
[2017-04-11 23:20:46 UTC] bammbino: 95% of the youtubers are now coming out about ads
[2017-04-11 23:20:49 UTC] codenameone: @Bammbino If all you know is what you've been told, then that's irresponsible.
[2017-04-11 23:21:08 UTC] manyperegrine81: Yes you can. That is being an adult. He is thirty five years old man.
[2017-04-11 23:21:41 UTC] yacherdy: What's funny is 95% of YouTubers I watch are not getting affected because none of them make money from youtube
[2017-04-11 23:21:46 UTC] bammbino: @CodenameOne, i dont like watching people shit on others isnt that okay? i dont follow every word phil says.. this is a you entertain me and i help support you type thing (and chill in streams)
[2017-04-11 23:21:58 UTC] expicell: @ManyPeregrine81 Phil is right, there is nothing but twitch left for him, i mean look at the economy, there are no good paying jobs in the USA
[2017-04-11 23:22:40 UTC] manyperegrine81: Once the electricity goes out nationwide, Phil's "career" is Dead!!
[2017-04-11 23:22:51 UTC] expicell: @Bammbino you expect phil to live off a $10 an hour job, forget it, twitch is the only way for him
[2017-04-11 23:22:55 UTC] yacherdy: *grabs popcorn*
[2017-04-11 23:22:56 UTC] codenameone: @Bammbino Most of them don't just endless shit all over everything in Phil's life. Some of them just reupload stuff, others comment and analyze, like Tevin.
[2017-04-11 23:23:07 UTC] yacherdy: Well, I don't have popcorn but I have a beer
[2017-04-11 23:23:14 UTC] bammbino: i have been on this site since day 1 and followed the fathers of twitch.. towelliee, mvg, and more... to see YOUTUBERS that are bigger than phil come to twitch full time says theres a problem
[2017-04-11 23:23:32 UTC] stuart360: Everytime Phil gets knocked down, he always ends up back on his feet. it must drive his haters insane lol
[2017-04-11 23:23:33 UTC] expicell: @ManyPeregrine81 if electricity goes out, then many ppls careers will be dead since nearly every business needs electricity
[2017-04-11 23:23:43 UTC] manyperegrine81: Yeah there is one of the "detractors" King of Pol said it best. Find yourself a Data Entry Position, show off that Computer Degree and get to work from home.
[2017-04-11 23:24:12 UTC] bammbino: @CodenameOne, if the real bad trolls werent so public, maybe i'd give the reuploaders a chance
[2017-04-11 23:24:22 UTC] manyperegrine81: Instead of his Legacy known as the Begger of Twitch every month....
[2017-04-11 23:24:26 UTC] bammbino: but majority of the haters that come here tell us and phil to kill ourselves
[2017-04-11 23:24:27 UTC] yacherdy: I had a data entry job for 15 an hour
[2017-04-11 23:24:48 UTC] expicell: @ManyPeregrine81 if he doesnt beg then what is he supposed to do? there are no jobs out there for him
[2017-04-11 23:24:48 UTC] yacherdy: been out of a job too long so have to start back at minimum wage
[2017-04-11 23:24:51 UTC] bammbino: i did security for $15/hour at mcclane
[2017-04-11 23:25:07 UTC] stuart360: Whats wrong with Data Entry?, i did that for near 10 years. Worked in a great team and had a good laugh
[2017-04-11 23:25:07 UTC] tantamounter: cheer135
[2017-04-11 23:25:20 UTC] yacherdy: nothing wrong
[2017-04-11 23:25:21 UTC] manyperegrine81: I might be getting an interview for a law firm pretty soon. To go along with my Security job and Navy Jobs.
[2017-04-11 23:25:35 UTC] yacherdy: good luck on that @ManyPeregrine81
[2017-04-11 23:25:38 UTC] manyperegrine81: As a Data Entry Clerk.
[2017-04-11 23:25:39 UTC] yacherdy: SeemsGood
[2017-04-11 23:25:41 UTC] codenameone: @Bammbino You should check out Tevin. He's assuredly one of Phil's most ardent critics, but he truly wants the best for Phil.
[2017-04-11 23:26:03 UTC] alexharveyconrad: I thought that was Argent.
[2017-04-11 23:26:19 UTC] bammbino: @CodenameOne, it'd be cool if they can have a non-public sitdown with phil
[2017-04-11 23:26:25 UTC] bammbino: too bad it went bad last time
[2017-04-11 23:26:30 UTC] manyperegrine81: Yeah, dude the jobs are there the most annoying parts are actually finding them and filling out their repetitive annoying applications.
[2017-04-11 23:26:34 UTC] stuart360: Everyone knows half the trolls actually really like Phil. You wouldn't obsess over someone as much as they do if they really did hate him
[2017-04-11 23:26:45 UTC] yacherdy: 2 hour long applications MingLee
[2017-04-11 23:27:04 UTC] codenameone: @Bammbino What are you talking about?
[2017-04-11 23:27:13 UTC] alexharveyconrad: @stuart360 True. Either that, or the YT community has gone severly south...
[2017-04-11 23:27:18 UTC] expicell: @ManyPeregrine81 phil doesnt have time to look for a job with 2 mortgages looming over his head, he needs immediate income, he cant be bothered with giving hours and hours of job inbterviews
[2017-04-11 23:27:23 UTC] bammbino: @CodenameOne, phil talked to the haters in the past and it never went well
[2017-04-11 23:27:41 UTC] bammbino: @CodenameOne, so i am saying that it'd be cool if they can like chat in private
[2017-04-11 23:27:43 UTC] manyperegrine81: His trolls is what keeping Phil relevant. Maybe that's why he has to remain controversial
[2017-04-11 23:27:50 UTC] bammbino: so they can say what they like/dont like from phil
[2017-04-11 23:27:54 UTC] bammbino: and not berate him
[2017-04-11 23:28:09 UTC] alexharveyconrad: To be honest, I discovered Phil through TIHYDNP Doom 3
[2017-04-11 23:28:11 UTC] manyperegrine81: Call Alex Jones, we have ourselves a conspiracy y'all lol
[2017-04-11 23:28:24 UTC] codenameone: @Bammbino Allegedly the SOK have offered Phil to come on the podcast, but obviously that's a public forum.
[2017-04-11 23:28:42 UTC] bammbino: yeah thats what i'd like both parties to avoid
[2017-04-11 23:28:48 UTC] codenameone: @alexharveyconrad That is one of the FUNNIEST ones I've ever seen.
[2017-04-11 23:28:57 UTC] yacherdy: YOU ARE SCUM! - Sorry; Alex Jones
[2017-04-11 23:29:01 UTC] yacherdy: MingLee
[2017-04-11 23:29:13 UTC] stuart360: Why shouls Phil speak to SOK, he owes them nothing. Bunch of SJW losrs who think they have some kind of power over him. Fuck them
[2017-04-11 23:29:24 UTC] expicell: @CodenameOne Fred Fuchs from SOK donates $20 a month to phils paterion
[2017-04-11 23:29:33 UTC] codenameone: @expicell Oh I know.
[2017-04-11 23:29:37 UTC] manyperegrine81: @yacherdy Alex has really shot themselves in the foot from PizzaGate.
[2017-04-11 23:29:42 UTC] bammbino: @stuart360, its not about oweing anyone anything.. its about trying to move forward in a peaceful manner
[2017-04-11 23:29:47 UTC] yacherdy: lol
[2017-04-11 23:29:49 UTC] alexharveyconrad: A well put TIHYDNP is a great promotion.... I honestly thought that Phil played bad intentionally and that his friend made that compilation... Litlle did I know of the horrors which will ensue.
[2017-04-11 23:29:56 UTC] expicell: @CodenameOne kind of ironic dont you think?
[2017-04-11 23:30:12 UTC] yacherdy: watch?v=KpLGYUsvj5U
[2017-04-11 23:30:23 UTC] alexharveyconrad: Wait... Fred donates to Phil?
[2017-04-11 23:30:27 UTC] manyperegrine81: What's that?
[2017-04-11 23:30:28 UTC] codenameone: @expicell No. They want him to improve. I have my own reasons for not liking the SOK, but they do want Phil to improve.
[2017-04-11 23:30:46 UTC] yacherdy: alex jones "excuse me" compilation
[2017-04-11 23:30:59 UTC] expicell: @alexharveyconrad yes, he donates $20 a month
[2017-04-11 23:31:00 UTC] stuart360: Fuck em Bammbino, sorry. The way they have behaved towards Phil over the years, trolling his Twittere, his gameplay, swatting him, dossing him, trolling his Youtube comments, etc, etc, etc. They should be the ones saying sorry to Phil
[2017-04-11 23:31:14 UTC] manyperegrine81: Yeah Fred Fuchs is genuine. Saw him debate against Viking.
[2017-04-11 23:31:30 UTC] codenameone: What's cool is that Phil HAS improved. The Phil of today is much more mature, intelligent, and calmer than the Phil of Connecticut.
[2017-04-11 23:31:35 UTC] alexharveyconrad: I saw patreon list, but I thought that it was some other guy... Well, this certainly makes the whole thing a lot more interesting.
[2017-04-11 23:31:48 UTC] bammbino: i didnt say phil has to say sorry, i said they should speak privately so he can get feedback from them... as some say here, a good amount of trolsl do want phil to get better
[2017-04-11 23:31:54 UTC] expicell: @stuart360 phil had brought a lot of it on himself especially when he said in a video "thank you, you worthless humans for the views!"
[2017-04-11 23:32:14 UTC] manyperegrine81: @stuart360 Please don't take everything that Phil said is the absolute truth. Giant grain of salt.
[2017-04-11 23:32:34 UTC] bammbino: one of MY suggestions was for him to stop shitting on devs and he will be able to get free/early copies of games as long as he keeps the comments about the game and not the employees
[2017-04-11 23:32:43 UTC] stuart360: Yes he brought it all on himslef, of course. This guy playing videogames in his spare room. get a fucking life.
[2017-04-11 23:32:44 UTC] yacherdy: well anyways...Phil AND detractors have some good points and bad points to their arguments.
[2017-04-11 23:32:45 UTC] bammbino: for the most part, he stopped it other than the bioware slamming
[2017-04-11 23:32:53 UTC] yacherdy: it's a morally grey area
[2017-04-11 23:33:16 UTC] alexharveyconrad: Imagine if one day Phil and SoK did a collab? That would be awesome.
[2017-04-11 23:33:17 UTC] yacherdy: I have a dream
[2017-04-11 23:33:23 UTC] bammbino: @stuart360, its not the games he played, its what phil used to say
[2017-04-11 23:33:27 UTC] yacherdy: that Phi...and detractors can one day walk in harmony
[2017-04-11 23:33:29 UTC] manyperegrine81: @expicell That was when YouTube wasn't so Corporate and Phil was still in his success years
[2017-04-11 23:33:54 UTC] bammbino: @stuart360, old phil would make a joke about gay people(not to offend them) and he caught himself last night when he talked about gil from me:a
[2017-04-11 23:34:05 UTC] bammbino: he was gonna say something but cut it off quick
[2017-04-11 23:34:12 UTC] stuart360: And he can say what he wants, its still a free country. It might not feel like it with all the SJW's destroying everything, but it is
[2017-04-11 23:34:21 UTC] yacherdy: wait he said it though bammbino :D
[2017-04-11 23:34:36 UTC] bammbino: im sure he was gonna say something worse YaCherdy
[2017-04-11 23:34:39 UTC] bammbino: i felt it lol
[2017-04-11 23:34:39 UTC] yacherdy: oh
[2017-04-11 23:34:45 UTC] yacherdy: maybe I don't know lol
[2017-04-11 23:34:46 UTC] expicell: @Bammbino i think over the years ppl take everything phil says way too seriously, its like ppl get offended about every little damn thing
[2017-04-11 23:34:51 UTC] codenameone: @Bammbino Or like during the Modern Warfare Remastered stream when he said "two camping faggots" and then apologized.
[2017-04-11 23:34:58 UTC] bammbino: @expicell, they do
[2017-04-11 23:35:14 UTC] codenameone: Go back to his MW2 gameplay and he's dropping "faggot" in nearly every video unabashedly.
[2017-04-11 23:35:27 UTC] yacherdy: well yeah with years comes maturity
[2017-04-11 23:35:38 UTC] manyperegrine81: "Advertiser UnFriendly"
[2017-04-11 23:35:39 UTC] yacherdy: I know I don't call things gay or fag anymore...
[2017-04-11 23:35:43 UTC] expicell: @Bammbino seems like today's generation is way too thin skinned and you have to make them feel entitled like little kids
[2017-04-11 23:35:45 UTC] bammbino: i was actually HURT ( weird huh?) when phil came out and said "how about this i dont care about KH2.8" and went off on the franchise yet im still here
[2017-04-11 23:35:45 UTC] yacherdy: Maybe when I was 13
[2017-04-11 23:35:48 UTC] codenameone: That's what I said; the Phil of today is far more mature.
[2017-04-11 23:36:00 UTC] yacherdy: no I agree codename
[2017-04-11 23:36:01 UTC] bammbino: it made me think he forced himself to play 2 after 1
[2017-04-11 23:36:03 UTC] yacherdy: was just saying
[2017-04-11 23:36:31 UTC] manyperegrine81: Phil is boring guys. He needs to get out of his giant house and do something with his Twitch.
[2017-04-11 23:36:31 UTC] expicell: @Bammbino how can you get hurt when he is just talking about not playing a certain game
[2017-04-11 23:36:42 UTC] manyperegrine81: Be like Ice Poseidon and do IRL.
[2017-04-11 23:37:02 UTC] bammbino: he went off on the story and franchise.. i was hurt cause my fav playthroughs of all time from phil is kh 1 and 2
[2017-04-11 23:37:03 UTC] stuart360: I don't know why some of you want to live in a world where everyone has to keep biting their lip and scruticising everything they are aboput to say just incase some snowflake gets offended by it. the human race is turning intoi a bunch of fucking pussies
[2017-04-11 23:37:30 UTC] manyperegrine81: BUT No, when I mentioned the last time do Security as a job, he actually said "it is too much walking". Shut up Phil...
[2017-04-11 23:37:32 UTC] yacherdy: I have to admit I'm a sensitive little guy stuart
[2017-04-11 23:37:49 UTC] expicell: @stuart360 yeah it seems everyone is such a pussy nowadays, what has the human race come to
[2017-04-11 23:37:49 UTC] alexharveyconrad: Political correctness is a dangerous manipulative tool.
[2017-04-11 23:37:51 UTC] manyperegrine81: And he drinks energy drinks
[2017-04-11 23:38:10 UTC] bammbino: YaCherdy, likes, not loves ME:A.. hes okay with people talking about it in a negative manner to a POINT
[2017-04-11 23:38:15 UTC] codenameone: @stuart360 I don't. I'm just saying that one has to know that saying things like "faggot" nowadays isn't going to fly. And really, no one should be offended by speech, but at the same time is there REALLY a need to say stuff like that?
[2017-04-11 23:38:24 UTC] bammbino: but phil encourages hatred in chat with his commentary
[2017-04-11 23:38:33 UTC] bammbino: so YaCherdy feels like hes outnumbered
[2017-04-11 23:38:39 UTC] bammbino: it can happen to any of us
[2017-04-11 23:38:46 UTC] expicell: @ManyPeregrine81 its tough playing video games for 4 hours straight, i get tired of playing any game within an hour, so i know where phil is coming from when says he is tired
[2017-04-11 23:38:49 UTC] stuart360: If we ever get attacked by aliens, it will be over in a few hours because half the population will say they don't believe in guns, and the other half will say its racist to attack aliens. Potty
[2017-04-11 23:39:00 UTC] yacherdy: @Bammbino yeah I was just defending the game I like..it's not even that I love it. Just intimidating when you have 150 people watching that call you an idiot :D
[2017-04-11 23:39:10 UTC] manyperegrine81: Maybe he should go outside and excercise.
[2017-04-11 23:39:15 UTC] yacherdy: @CodenameOne agreed...I'm not a SJW, but faggot, the word, is kind of immature.
[2017-04-11 23:39:27 UTC] yacherdy: just feels so middle school
[2017-04-11 23:39:42 UTC] manyperegrine81: Make himself look more attractive for Leanna and raise his self esteem.
[2017-04-11 23:39:49 UTC] bammbino: we can all agree that the big contributer to making phil angry is unfinished/unpolished/or outright bad games
[2017-04-11 23:39:58 UTC] expicell: @ManyPeregrine81 one time i played mass effect andromeda for 2.5 hrs and my eyes were red, i dont know how phil manages to play 6 to 7 hours a day
[2017-04-11 23:40:00 UTC] yacherdy: look at the overrusle logs from last night..I feel I was pretty calm, cool and collective.
[2017-04-11 23:40:21 UTC] yacherdy: overrustle*
[2017-04-11 23:40:23 UTC] bammbino: i didnt get ghost recon cause its unfinished... people cried that pil didnt get it yet he'd be depressed playing that stinker
[2017-04-11 23:40:33 UTC] codenameone: @Bammbino That should make anyone angry. Consumers need to be more vocal in their criticisms. This gen has really sucked ass, and this industry is rotten.
[2017-04-11 23:40:52 UTC] yacherdy: Sucked ass?
[2017-04-11 23:40:59 UTC] bammbino: @CodenameOne, valve is the first company taking action
[2017-04-11 23:41:04 UTC] codenameone: Sucks ass? Current tense?
[2017-04-11 23:41:09 UTC] bammbino: they want fake/bad games off their platform
[2017-04-11 23:41:16 UTC] stuart360: Hate the word faggot, never used it, but sometimes things get said without thinking, thats human nature. You can't do that anymore though without a huge backlash, no mistakes or human error allowed.
[2017-04-11 23:41:24 UTC] yacherdy: I'd have to disagree...lots of great games came out in the past 7 years
[2017-04-11 23:41:28 UTC] manyperegrine81: @expicell But you don't just play video games all day right?
[2017-04-11 23:41:38 UTC] yacherdy: @stuart360 true I say stupid shit all the time and don't mean it
[2017-04-11 23:41:46 UTC] yacherdy: Trying to grow as a person
[2017-04-11 23:41:52 UTC] codenameone: @YaCherdy This gen's only been alive for the past 5.
[2017-04-11 23:41:55 UTC] yacherdy: human nature
[2017-04-11 23:42:07 UTC] bammbino: @YaCherdy, what he means is companies like ubisoft and ea forcing devs to release games early
[2017-04-11 23:42:09 UTC] yacherdy: @CodenameOne oh sorry for some reason you meant this decade
[2017-04-11 23:42:14 UTC] yacherdy: I thought*
[2017-04-11 23:42:23 UTC] expicell: @ManyPeregrine81 nah, i do other stuff but i am saying i probably couldnt just play 6 to 7 hours a day like phil does, my eyes would be dead
[2017-04-11 23:42:25 UTC] yacherdy: yeah I can agree on that @Bammbino
[2017-04-11 23:42:45 UTC] bammbino: the PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT example of it is ff15
[2017-04-11 23:43:03 UTC] manyperegrine81: Yeah that's the problem.
[2017-04-11 23:43:03 UTC] bammbino: Square enix the CORPORATE part of the business said times up
[2017-04-11 23:43:11 UTC] bammbino: you have until november to release it
[2017-04-11 23:43:22 UTC] stuart360: Mass Effect could of been a different game with 6 months more polish. You can't blame EA totally though, 5 months is a long time
[2017-04-11 23:43:23 UTC] bammbino: no if/ands about it
[2017-04-11 23:43:29 UTC] stuart360: 5 years lol
[2017-04-11 23:43:37 UTC] expicell: there are ppl out there who work much less than phil yet they make more than him
[2017-04-11 23:43:41 UTC] yacherdy: It's just there's so much games coming out every year.
[2017-04-11 23:43:41 UTC] codenameone: This gen just really has not been good to me. I hated Fallout 4, I hate BF1, MGSV was only OK, MEA is lame, etc.
[2017-04-11 23:44:01 UTC] expicell: ME:A was a HUGE dissapointmetn for me
[2017-04-11 23:44:02 UTC] manyperegrine81: I liked Battlefield 1
[2017-04-11 23:44:11 UTC] yacherdy: @CodenameOne what about Nier, Nioh, Dark Souls, Uncharted, South Park, witcher etc?
[2017-04-11 23:44:15 UTC] yacherdy: persona
[2017-04-11 23:44:20 UTC] bammbino: ME:A's issue is that there was a fallout between the 2 studios working on the game
[2017-04-11 23:44:26 UTC] expicell: I thought ME:A is like a pregnant women who had a miscarriage
[2017-04-11 23:44:29 UTC] codenameone: @YaCherdy I didn't play a single one of those.
[2017-04-11 23:44:31 UTC] bammbino: in 2016 animations were fine and charas looked good
[2017-04-11 23:44:32 UTC] yacherdy: @expicell WutFace
[2017-04-11 23:44:36 UTC] yacherdy: @CodenameOne oh nvm then lol
[2017-04-11 23:44:37 UTC] bammbino: in 2017 it was all fucked up
[2017-04-11 23:44:56 UTC] yacherdy: @CodenameOne maybe you just don't like modern games
[2017-04-11 23:45:30 UTC] yacherdy: and or gaming
[2017-04-11 23:45:32 UTC] codenameone: I'm REALLY fucking stingy with my money. So a game like South Park I was hesitant, and I didn't like Witcher 2 so I skipped 3.
[2017-04-11 23:45:38 UTC] yacherdy: ah gotcha
[2017-04-11 23:45:45 UTC] bammbino: https://cdn.gamerant . com/wp-content/uploads/mass-effect-andromeda-day-one-patch-sara-ryder-face-comparison.jpg
[2017-04-11 23:45:50 UTC] yacherdy: deleted
[2017-04-11 23:45:52 UTC] bammbino: remove the spaces for . com
[2017-04-11 23:45:55 UTC] bammbino: really?
[2017-04-11 23:45:59 UTC] codenameone: I loved Bloodborne, in my defense.
[2017-04-11 23:46:02 UTC] yacherdy: let me check
[2017-04-11 23:46:13 UTC] bammbino: you guys need better twitch tv
[2017-04-11 23:46:21 UTC] manyperegrine81: I notice there are still 300 viewers. There are the rest
[2017-04-11 23:46:43 UTC] stuart360: Should game on PC Codenameone, some great key sites online if you shop around. I bought a game yesterday for £2.30, and the game is £23 on Steam
[2017-04-11 23:47:11 UTC] manyperegrine81: I might get Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC.
[2017-04-11 23:47:16 UTC] yacherdy: I feel bad buying steam keys
[2017-04-11 23:47:29 UTC] bammbino: i like pc, but im more of a solo MP guy and PC is full of hackers or groups that gang you lol
[2017-04-11 23:47:40 UTC] yacherdy: Not saying you shouldn't, just for me personally
[2017-04-11 23:47:53 UTC] stuart360: Don't do Yacherdy, most online key sites get their keys from the publishers. There are some that don't but most do
[2017-04-11 23:47:55 UTC] bammbino: on ps4 i can play a MP game and know that matchmaking has me with others in my boat
[2017-04-11 23:47:58 UTC] codenameone: @stuart360 Noooooo thank you. I've done enough PC gaming to know I couldn't stand it full time. Way too much frustration with incompatibilities and drivers and getting mods to work and shit.
[2017-04-11 23:48:07 UTC] yacherdy: @stuart360 yeah I suppose
[2017-04-11 23:48:18 UTC] yacherdy: lol codename
[2017-04-11 23:48:27 UTC] bammbino: the upgrading of pc parts too NotLikeThis
[2017-04-11 23:48:33 UTC] codenameone: I had to jump through so many hoops to get GTA SA to work with Window 10 PLUS mods. That was just one game.
[2017-04-11 23:48:36 UTC] bammbino: this rig ran me $4k in 2012
[2017-04-11 23:48:39 UTC] yacherdy: reminds me I need to upgrade MingLee
[2017-04-11 23:48:47 UTC] bammbino: its almost extinct for games
[2017-04-11 23:48:48 UTC] yacherdy: well SA is a POS on PC
[2017-04-11 23:48:55 UTC] stuart360: Thats true codenameone, you do get used to it though, and i do find its not as bad today as it used to be years ago
[2017-04-11 23:49:07 UTC] yacherdy: rockstar gives no fucks
[2017-04-11 23:49:16 UTC] yacherdy: all their PC ports suck
[2017-04-11 23:49:19 UTC] bammbino: rockstar cares
[2017-04-11 23:49:22 UTC] bammbino: take2 doesnt
[2017-04-11 23:49:30 UTC] yacherdy: yeah wrong wording
[2017-04-11 23:49:40 UTC] codenameone: @YaCherdy It kind of is. I get insane amounts of pop-in and texture quality loss with mods installed.
[2017-04-11 23:49:46 UTC] bammbino: the devs for WWE games made GREAT GAMES! smackdon shut your mouth <3
[2017-04-11 23:49:49 UTC] manyperegrine81: I'm looking into building my own PC but it is getting expensive. I might stick to my PS4 as my last gaming console.
[2017-04-11 23:49:52 UTC] bammbino: but take2 came out with bullshit
[2017-04-11 23:50:08 UTC] manyperegrine81: Just save money on a Solid State Drive.
[2017-04-11 23:50:32 UTC] yacherdy: I tried to play SA but gave up not wanting to deal with mods
[2017-04-11 23:50:44 UTC] codenameone: I downloaded a mod for Fallout 3 the other day. I have dozens of other mods that work just fine, but just this one won't work. I put the folders in all the right places and shit but still no dice.
[2017-04-11 23:50:53 UTC] bammbino: @ManyPeregrine81, if phil had bought a ssd for his ps4, games would of cleared much faster
[2017-04-11 23:50:54 UTC] stuart360: Yeah SSD's are getting almsot manditory at the moment,with all the dodgy ports we are getting in. I have 2 120gb SSD's and they are always full lol
[2017-04-11 23:51:01 UTC] codenameone: Just one mod that said "fuck you". I get a mod for FO4 on Xbox, guaranteed to work.
[2017-04-11 23:51:08 UTC] bammbino: FF15 had up to 2min loading times for phil.. 10-20sec for me lol
[2017-04-11 23:51:10 UTC] yacherdy: SSD's never go down in price NotLikeThis
[2017-04-11 23:51:37 UTC] yacherdy: ME2 had like 1 minute load times on consoles....5 seconds tops on PC MingLee
[2017-04-11 23:51:46 UTC] bammbino: mine did cherdy
[2017-04-11 23:51:52 UTC] codenameone: SSD's are the one thing that makes PC gaming so appealing because holy fuck loading screens make me rage.
[2017-04-11 23:51:55 UTC] bammbino: corsair EVO 850 1tb
[2017-04-11 23:52:05 UTC] stuart360: Saw a nice Samsung 250gb on E-Bay for £60 though, its a really good price, i may bite
[2017-04-11 23:52:36 UTC] yacherdy: yeah I'm looking for the samsung 850 250gb (original I know) and it usually stats around 90 dollars
[2017-04-11 23:52:43 UTC] yacherdy: stays8
[2017-04-11 23:52:45 UTC] yacherdy: stays*
[2017-04-11 23:52:47 UTC] yacherdy: jeez
[2017-04-11 23:52:52 UTC] codenameone: Ruined
[2017-04-11 23:52:54 UTC] bammbino: for ps4 or pc?
[2017-04-11 23:52:57 UTC] yacherdy: PC
[2017-04-11 23:53:06 UTC] bammbino: ya dont get 250 for ps4 lol
[2017-04-11 23:53:13 UTC] manyperegrine81: Yeah, you can get a 2TD SSD on Amazon for 100 dollars. That more than enough for my PS4
[2017-04-11 23:53:33 UTC] bammbino: the higher the price, the faster it is tho
[2017-04-11 23:53:41 UTC] bammbino: space isnt my only concern
[2017-04-11 23:53:45 UTC] stuart360: What specs are you PC Yacherdy
[2017-04-11 23:53:51 UTC] bammbino: bloodborne's loading times WERE CANCER
[2017-04-11 23:53:58 UTC] bammbino: C A N C E R
[2017-04-11 23:54:22 UTC] yacherdy: lol
[2017-04-11 23:54:45 UTC] manyperegrine81: Hey what's up all
[2017-04-11 23:55:10 UTC] stuart360: lol the loading time on Phils PS4 Witcher 3 playthrough. As soon as that loading screen comes up with the picture, it loads on an SSD, so good
[2017-04-11 23:55:35 UTC] manyperegrine81: Sorry I accidentally logged into another Streamers
[2017-04-11 23:55:43 UTC] yacherdy: @stuart360 i5 4690k, msi 970, 1tb caviar blue WD, MSI Z97S SLI Krait mobo
[2017-04-11 23:55:47 UTC] yacherdy: need new ram and ssd
[2017-04-11 23:56:14 UTC] yacherdy: well I need to upgrade a lot of shit
[2017-04-11 23:56:15 UTC] manyperegrine81: So you guys are saying I should skip building a PC
[2017-04-11 23:56:15 UTC] stuart360: Not bad Yacherdy, still more powerful than PS4Pro
[2017-04-11 23:56:28 UTC] yacherdy: yeah I'm a couple years behind but still gets shit done
[2017-04-11 23:56:39 UTC] bammbino: thats the issue lol
[2017-04-11 23:56:47 UTC] bammbino: of course we can still play games
[2017-04-11 23:56:50 UTC] yacherdy: @ManyPeregrine81 well if you truly want to save money but I found building mine was almost a religious experience lol
[2017-04-11 23:56:56 UTC] bammbino: but we dont get good optimization from devs
[2017-04-11 23:57:16 UTC] bammbino: i wanna see the next game that says no to my 660ti
[2017-04-11 23:57:58 UTC] manyperegrine81: Interesting
[2017-04-11 23:58:10 UTC] bammbino: i bought my parts and paid a tech to put it together, im too scared to do it myself
