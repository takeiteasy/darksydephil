[2017-04-25 23:12:21 UTC] saking91: I love phil but i'm sorry, that was just bad
[2017-04-25 23:12:34 UTC] skyfx89: indeed this was bad
[2017-04-25 23:12:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: saking91, you probably have a different version of the game
[2017-04-25 23:12:37 UTC] kovorus: bye doods Poooound
[2017-04-25 23:12:41 UTC] yacherdy: Poooound

[2017-04-25 23:13:09 UTC] saking91: he just wasn't very observant, imo
[2017-04-25 23:13:17 UTC] darthvidarviking: you can just say that you though it was bad witout sounding so gay @saking91
[2017-04-25 23:13:19 UTC] ornightz: See ya'll in 3hrs
[2017-04-25 23:13:40 UTC] saking91: but i am gay
[2017-04-25 23:13:42 UTC] thepastryarchy: I just missed it. Why was this bad?
[2017-04-25 23:13:44 UTC] yacherdy: damn rip
[2017-04-25 23:13:51 UTC] darthvidarviking: haha me too that isn't the point lol
[2017-04-25 23:13:57 UTC] yacherdy: me too
[2017-04-25 23:14:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the game is too cryptic thepastryarchy Red Barrels have taken the game in a different (wrong) direction compared to the original
[2017-04-25 23:14:54 UTC] saking91: hopefully, going forward he is more observant
[2017-04-25 23:15:06 UTC] yacherdy: Poor Phil
[2017-04-25 23:15:17 UTC] macaronitimeyg: is there going to be dlc that the game plays for me?
[2017-04-25 23:15:19 UTC] darthvidarviking: if you love him hard enough he will be @saking91 :D
[2017-04-25 23:15:24 UTC] saking91: It is certainly more cryptic, but in my experience with the game so far, I haven't gotten completely stuck like he just did
[2017-04-25 23:15:26 UTC] kyll_chan: now I'm curious. usually a well designed backtracking segment immediatly presents you the goal , and by doing so it gives you the motivation to go look for something to unlock the door and back to it. was this the case?
[2017-04-25 23:15:43 UTC] darksydephil: no
[2017-04-25 23:15:48 UTC] coralguy: lol
[2017-04-25 23:15:52 UTC] darksydephil: the goal was hidden in a side room that's not obvious to find
[2017-04-25 23:15:52 UTC] yacherdy: PogChamp
[2017-04-25 23:15:54 UTC] darksydephil: that was the problem
[2017-04-25 23:15:55 UTC] saking91: Phil's issue here was that he never found the first area
[2017-04-25 23:16:09 UTC] kyll_chan: oh shit
[2017-04-25 23:16:10 UTC] coralguy: phil with the quick react, on point sir
[2017-04-25 23:16:12 UTC] darksydephil: it wasn't even in the path that's obvious to tak ethrough that area
[2017-04-25 23:16:14 UTC] saking91: which made it difficult to know what to use the hook fod
[2017-04-25 23:16:17 UTC] saking91: *for
[2017-04-25 23:16:19 UTC] thepastryarchy: Hmm. Guess I'll catch the playlist later! More tonight, Phil?
[2017-04-25 23:16:30 UTC] darksydephil: that one segment was awful lol
[2017-04-25 23:16:35 UTC] saking91: there were 2 areas to go through there
[2017-04-25 23:16:43 UTC] coralguy: thats going to be a fum youtube segement on dspgaming
[2017-04-25 23:16:46 UTC] yacherdy: *eats garlic balls and sips on lemonade*
[2017-04-25 23:17:00 UTC] macaronitimeyg: I hope there upcoming dlc that gets rid of the cryptic and archaic parts of the game
[2017-04-25 23:17:12 UTC] saking91: It took me about 5 minutes to get through that section
[2017-04-25 23:17:43 UTC] saking91: the harder part for me was the annoying woman....the backtracking wasn't confusing
[2017-04-25 23:17:53 UTC] darksydephil: that's part of the problem though
[2017-04-25 23:18:05 UTC] darksydephil: if you have a crazy insta-kill woman chasing you, how can you be expected to fully explore every single area
[2017-04-25 23:18:18 UTC] coralguy: soma was way better
[2017-04-25 23:18:20 UTC] darksydephil: the answer: you can't. you'd would have had to get lucky and stumble upon that door before you ever found the hook
[2017-04-25 23:18:43 UTC] darksydephil: that's awful game design. the game should have put you at that door first, THEN off to find the hook.
[2017-04-25 23:19:40 UTC] 1shenron: Agreed, for new people I find that this isn't a good starter for a 5hr game imo
[2017-04-25 23:19:53 UTC] darksydephil: to be fair, there were a few things in Outlast 1 I got stuck on, but not for more than a few minutes since the maps were all indoors, so even getting confused it didn't take long to figure out
[2017-04-25 23:19:59 UTC] saking91: you gotta be very observant in this game, haha. I noticed there were 2 paths before I entered the area. anyway, I hope the your experience with the game improves
[2017-04-25 23:20:02 UTC] darksydephil: but now you're in an open world...some people might take a hour to figure out that puzzle lol
[2017-04-25 23:20:45 UTC] saking91: I will say that the game does struggle with those chase scenes in an open-world environment....there have been plenty of times where I got killed cause I didn't know where to run to
[2017-04-25 23:21:02 UTC] saking91: so I see your point....I just had a better experience with that section, I guess
[2017-04-25 23:22:54 UTC] darksydephil: yeah. i guarantee i wouldn't have even raised it as a negative point if i'd been lucky enough to stumble upon that grating/door first and KNEW that's where to go back to
[2017-04-25 23:23:10 UTC] darksydephil: but that's the game devs job: to guide you there first. they didn't at all, in fact the placement of the woman led me in the other direction lol
[2017-04-25 23:23:47 UTC] saking91: fair point
[2017-04-25 23:54:23 UTC] jlawlar: cool
