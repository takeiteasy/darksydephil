[2017-04-15 03:01:13 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil This is actually my tip: did you try using Laylee's glide and try to smash the ice to free the last ghost?
[2017-04-15 03:01:17 UTC] vendatus: Unless it's pretzel crust with nacho cheese inside Kreygasm
[2017-04-15 03:01:19 UTC] akioartorius: @DarksydePhil Derich was saying if you could glide and smash the ice I think

[2017-04-15 03:57:50 UTC] tr9000: Most games would just block an area off completely if you don't have the necessary ability, this game lets you go through 6 rooms before finding out you need an ability
