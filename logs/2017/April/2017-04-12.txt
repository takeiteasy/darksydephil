[2017-04-12 00:00:18 UTC] yacherdy: pcpartpicker?
[2017-04-12 00:00:18 UTC] manyperegrine81: Pcpartpickers(dot)com
[2017-04-12 00:00:25 UTC] yacherdy: yes that's a great place to start
[2017-04-12 00:00:38 UTC] yacherdy: I always day dream and build shit I can't afford on there
[2017-04-12 00:00:53 UTC] yacherdy: overclocked* not overlocked WutFace
[2017-04-12 00:01:04 UTC] stuart360: Yeah tried that Yacherdy. I got it to 72fps. I liked the extra frames but it looked a bit wierfd, the image quality
[2017-04-12 00:01:16 UTC] manyperegrine81: Will it give me instructions on how to do it? And what is convincing for me to go with for?
[2017-04-12 00:01:25 UTC] yacherdy: I believe I got to 74ghz...works well so far
[2017-04-12 00:01:29 UTC] manyperegrine81: I'm totally a PC noob
[2017-04-12 00:01:52 UTC] yacherdy: hz not ghz
[2017-04-12 00:01:54 UTC] yacherdy: anyways
[2017-04-12 00:01:54 UTC] bammbino: youtube has good guides to do it now
[2017-04-12 00:02:02 UTC] bammbino: since we're in a video world now
[2017-04-12 00:02:27 UTC] manyperegrine81: Imagination üåà
[2017-04-12 00:02:45 UTC] yacherdy: youtube is your friend....check out LinusTechTips or Austin Evans or perhaps JayzTwoCents
[2017-04-12 00:03:10 UTC] yacherdy: I built mine strictly from watching youtube vids
[2017-04-12 00:03:14 UTC] bammbino: linus... god's perfect man
[2017-04-12 00:03:30 UTC] manyperegrine81: Can I build a custom laptop?
[2017-04-12 00:03:36 UTC] bammbino: lol ugh
[2017-04-12 00:03:54 UTC] bammbino: YOU cant, but you can get one custom made
[2017-04-12 00:03:56 UTC] yacherdy: Truth be told: I started off with CyberPowerpc...but found the joy of building my own, so I stripped the parts and built it with other parts I bought
[2017-04-12 00:04:02 UTC] bammbino: origin and others do that
[2017-04-12 00:04:02 UTC] stuart360: laptops are a waste of money, just my opinion
[2017-04-12 00:04:03 UTC] manyperegrine81: A "PC On the Go"
[2017-04-12 00:04:13 UTC] yacherdy: Laptop's aren't the best for gaming but it's your choice
[2017-04-12 00:04:17 UTC] yacherdy: depends what you play
[2017-04-12 00:04:37 UTC] bammbino: laptops have heat distribution problems and thats the #1 killer for gaming
[2017-04-12 00:05:19 UTC] stuart360: If you spent ¬£500 on a laptop, you could actually make a very decent desktop if you shopped around with that kind of money
[2017-04-12 00:05:28 UTC] manyperegrine81: That's pretty cool man. I want to start playing games like Player Unknown Battlegrounds, Counter Strike and stream Battlefield 1 from my PS4.
[2017-04-12 00:05:37 UTC] yacherdy: they have build guides too pcpartpicker.(dotcom)/guide/
[2017-04-12 00:05:49 UTC] bammbino: streaming needs good setups lol
[2017-04-12 00:06:11 UTC] stuart360: yep Bammbino lol, a real good one
[2017-04-12 00:06:15 UTC] yacherdy: I stream 720p and 60frames and get good results
[2017-04-12 00:06:35 UTC] stuart360: Yours is a very decent PC tghough Yacherdy
[2017-04-12 00:06:58 UTC] manyperegrine81: I wonder how will streaming Couterstrike on my Samsung Laptop would look like.
[2017-04-12 00:06:59 UTC] yacherdy: Oh I know..I'm just saying it can be done just need to spend a bit :p
[2017-04-12 00:07:22 UTC] bammbino: counterstrike is somewhat old.. so new pc parts OVERWORK to play the game
[2017-04-12 00:07:27 UTC] bammbino: weird how that works
[2017-04-12 00:07:39 UTC] yacherdy: Technology eh? MingLee
[2017-04-12 00:07:42 UTC] stuart360: Any games you have trouble max9ing out Yacherdy?, you should be able to max most games at 1080p right?
[2017-04-12 00:08:00 UTC] bammbino: games like pokemon and other old games have KILLED people's gaming rigs
[2017-04-12 00:08:08 UTC] bammbino: the parts stressed themselves out
[2017-04-12 00:08:13 UTC] yacherdy: @stuart360 Some newer games I have trouble with. ME:A is not friendly to me but most of the time I can max everything out
[2017-04-12 00:08:14 UTC] manyperegrine81: I bet it will look like total garbage, because I tried playing Ghostbusters. God, it looked awful. Never played it since.
[2017-04-12 00:08:53 UTC] yacherdy: Fallout 4 I had some trouble with as well
[2017-04-12 00:08:59 UTC] stuart360: Andromeda is not the best optimized though. I can max it at ultra at 1080p but cpu and gpu usage are bother in the 60-80% usage range
[2017-04-12 00:09:10 UTC] yacherdy: true stuart
[2017-04-12 00:09:12 UTC] manyperegrine81: Really old games overworked gaming rigs
[2017-04-12 00:09:26 UTC] manyperegrine81: And their parts. That's insane.
[2017-04-12 00:09:34 UTC] yacherdy: yeah it happens
[2017-04-12 00:09:37 UTC] yacherdy: weird
[2017-04-12 00:10:29 UTC] bammbino: i think i read that its cause the parts are trying to aim for specific details that they were made to do
[2017-04-12 00:11:32 UTC] manyperegrine81: Will Phil ever go back to BF1?
[2017-04-12 00:12:03 UTC] manyperegrine81: Their season pass has already started and all that stuff.
[2017-04-12 00:12:15 UTC] yacherdy: I doubt it
[2017-04-12 00:12:35 UTC] yacherdy: I think it's been 4 months, Christmas time.
[2017-04-12 00:12:56 UTC] manyperegrine81: It is like he is deliberately trying to avoid multiplayer games.
[2017-04-12 00:13:08 UTC] manyperegrine81: Out of risk of being trolled
[2017-04-12 00:13:18 UTC] yacherdy: Mayhaps
[2017-04-12 00:13:50 UTC] yacherdy: Although he did do Twitch and Chill multiple times
[2017-04-12 00:14:18 UTC] manyperegrine81: Oh yeah. I forgot about that.
[2017-04-12 00:14:34 UTC] manyperegrine81: Been mostly focusing on BF1 and Overwatch.
[2017-04-12 00:15:16 UTC] yacherdy: I played A LOT of Overwatch through the summer until a couple months ago. My problem is I'm a big single player guy so often think "these MP hours can go into SP games that I need to play"
[2017-04-12 00:15:22 UTC] yacherdy: but Overwatch is incredibly fun
[2017-04-12 00:15:42 UTC] yacherdy: and put 200+ hours into
[2017-04-12 00:18:33 UTC] manyperegrine81: üëçüèº

[2017-04-12 18:09:02 UTC] darksydephil: i'm pretty sure bioware is losing a ton of cred with gamers after andromeda, so if they're making a game like that, they're just continuing down that toilet path

[2017-04-12 18:12:14 UTC] eternia_forever: hey @errnoent
[2017-04-12 18:12:15 UTC] anondublo1: Destiny is without a doubt the most boring FPS I've ever played
[2017-04-12 18:12:18 UTC] splitplaythru: the spoiling thing, not the bioware stuff
[2017-04-12 18:12:22 UTC] lvlpower: @errnoent was up

[2017-04-12 18:12:26 UTC] goldencolts: i honestly was hoping bungie would abandon destiny and just try a new IP again

[2017-04-12 18:12:37 UTC] errnoent: listening to die antwoord waiting for phil to start up :D
[2017-04-12 18:12:42 UTC] betheboom: mass effect andromeda is a great game it should've been 2nd at least
[2017-04-12 18:12:45 UTC] eternia_forever: sup @theycallmejimbob
[2017-04-12 18:12:45 UTC] goldencolts: I dont get why they abandoned halo to make an inferior version of halo with rpg elements
[2017-04-12 18:12:52 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey eternia how goes it
[2017-04-12 18:12:52 UTC] blue_blur64: Like, it's fine to give help and tips, but keep it to what Phil is able to do at the point he is in the game
[2017-04-12 18:12:59 UTC] radicalenzyme: It was not made by the real bioware they are off making a new IP EA has just renamed a bunch of their studios as bioware
[2017-04-12 18:13:06 UTC] blue_blur64: Don't give stuff out that doesn't happen for several more hours
[2017-04-12 18:13:07 UTC] anondublo1: RPG elements is being generous
[2017-04-12 18:13:28 UTC] anondublo1: puddle deep loot system and multiplayer missions Kappa
[2017-04-12 18:13:29 UTC] lioncock: it felt like a 1000x more grindy borderlands with less personality for me
[2017-04-12 18:13:29 UTC] darksydephil: ok stream is giong live!
[2017-04-12 18:13:40 UTC] eternia_forever: is the real bioware even the real bioware anymore @radicalenzyme ?
[2017-04-12 18:13:42 UTC] lioncock: i know its technically supposed to be a diff style of game but thats what i got from it

[2017-04-12 18:13:53 UTC] darksydephil: the first release of Destiny was far worse than Borderlands

[2017-04-12 18:14:00 UTC] darksydephil: but everyone seems to agree that the expansions made it better
[2017-04-12 18:14:11 UTC] lioncock: you can have that opinion, i just dont like destiny after all the hours i put it
[2017-04-12 18:14:17 UTC] ufccurbstomp: The first year of Destiny was a beta test period.
[2017-04-12 18:14:26 UTC] lioncock: in*
[2017-04-12 18:14:30 UTC] anondublo1: You can't even really compare the two. They're both FPS games with loot and multiplayer, that's about it.
[2017-04-12 18:14:33 UTC] goldencolts: it didn't matter to most people since they deserted the game long before the dlcs came
[2017-04-12 18:14:33 UTC] blue_blur64: Well hopefully they learned their lesson and Destiny 2 starts out great
[2017-04-12 18:14:38 UTC] errnoent: enter the ninja GivePLZ StinkyCheese TakeNRG
[2017-04-12 18:14:42 UTC] anondublo1: The gameplay itself differs greatly.
[2017-04-12 18:14:46 UTC] betheboom: bring back FACEBOT
[2017-04-12 18:14:48 UTC] lioncock: yeah i noted that they are diff genres, but thats what i took from it personally
[2017-04-12 18:14:54 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh yeah Phil, Yakuza 1's remaster is coming out August 29th :P
[2017-04-12 18:15:04 UTC] ufccurbstomp: I do have faith that Bungie can "fix" the franchise with Destiny 2
[2017-04-12 18:15:05 UTC] blue_blur64: And it's only $30
[2017-04-12 18:15:18 UTC] thekingofcrybabys2hd: new twitch layout?
[2017-04-12 18:15:20 UTC] betheboom: ugh not yakuza too
[2017-04-12 18:15:20 UTC] anondublo1: Kappa
[2017-04-12 18:15:30 UTC] blue_blur64: Yup, Sega is busy this year xD
[2017-04-12 18:15:36 UTC] darksydephil: no way im playing another yakuza this year lol
[2017-04-12 18:15:41 UTC] eternia_forever: have they agreed to do 2 3 4 on disc for north america @blue_blur64
[2017-04-12 18:15:42 UTC] goldencolts: hope you like GIANT purple bars with your new layout brah Kappa
[2017-04-12 18:15:45 UTC] poorlymade: Hey Phil!
[2017-04-12 18:15:52 UTC] anondublo1: I hope Bungie can polish Destiny 2 into a good game.
[2017-04-12 18:15:56 UTC] blue_blur64: That I don't know. I just know about 1
[2017-04-12 18:16:06 UTC] thekingofcrybabys2hd: Too much purple
[2017-04-12 18:16:14 UTC] betheboom: next thing will be remaster of 2
[2017-04-12 18:16:22 UTC] betheboom: NotLikeThis
[2017-04-12 18:16:32 UTC] 007blaine: phil you can play persona 5 in may
[2017-04-12 18:16:45 UTC] eternia_forever: still waiting for re3 and code veronica remaster on disc for ps4 @blue_blur64
[2017-04-12 18:16:47 UTC] blue_blur64: Someone brought up a good point though on twitter. Yakuza 1 remaster is $30, Bayonetta 2 on PC is $20 (which is a steal)
[2017-04-12 18:16:50 UTC] lioncock: luckily there are so many decent games set to come out this year/already out but havent bought yet for me to have to worry about Destiny 2 being better, at least in my case
[2017-04-12 18:16:57 UTC] blue_blur64: Why is Bulletstorm remastered $60? xD
[2017-04-12 18:16:59 UTC] lioncock: its like Watch Dogs, i learned my lesson with that game too
[2017-04-12 18:17:09 UTC] lioncock: some games just arent for me i guess
[2017-04-12 18:17:10 UTC] betheboom: ewww bayonetta
[2017-04-12 18:17:21 UTC] vendatus: WutFace
[2017-04-12 18:17:22 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @blue_blur64 the same reason why gearbox tried to partner with G2A - they're idiots
[2017-04-12 18:17:24 UTC] betheboom: lol silent
[2017-04-12 18:17:31 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh wait, Bayonetta 1 on PC, my bad
[2017-04-12 18:17:32 UTC] errnoent: 2017 has been and is probably going to continue to be a lame year for gaming..
[2017-04-12 18:17:41 UTC] betheboom: watch dogs 1 and 2 were great games
[2017-04-12 18:17:46 UTC] lioncock: different strokes for different folks
[2017-04-12 18:17:51 UTC] blue_blur64: I disagree @errnoent , I love this year so far

[2017-04-12 18:18:05 UTC] darksydephil: testing
[2017-04-12 18:18:08 UTC] pcgamehunter: Well then again I played Persona last year, so with the exception of that lol
[2017-04-12 18:18:11 UTC] blue_blur64: With how many hits are already out, it honestly is better this year xD
[2017-04-12 18:18:12 UTC] anondublo1: I can't even remember the last good year for video games tbh.
[2017-04-12 18:18:13 UTC] eternia_forever: yes phil
[2017-04-12 18:18:18 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @errnoent you keep saying this despite the majority of people saying you're wrong
[2017-04-12 18:18:18 UTC] lioncock: tbh Steam doesnt like to accept my debit card for some stupid reason so i buy from g2a when they fuck me out of buying directly
[2017-04-12 18:18:22 UTC] eternia_forever: ?
[2017-04-12 18:18:31 UTC] betheboom: resi 7, zelda, horizon and mass effect had made this year in gaming good so far
[2017-04-12 18:18:31 UTC] darksydephil: ok good stream chat is working
[2017-04-12 18:18:34 UTC] errnoent: At least last year we got DS3 and U4 and Doom
[2017-04-12 18:18:35 UTC] darksydephil: brb gonna grab drinks, then we'll get started
[2017-04-12 18:19:15 UTC] blue_blur64: That's only 3 though. That's not much for a full year xD
[2017-04-12 18:19:18 UTC] errnoent: @ufccurbstomp and I will continue to say it despite this stream chat disagreeing with me
[2017-04-12 18:19:26 UTC] blue_blur64: We've already got a bunch of hits in the first few months
[2017-04-12 18:19:30 UTC] lioncock: id prefer to buy games from steam even for full price but if they are act like my debit card doesnt have the funds ill just get the game somewhere else
[2017-04-12 18:19:32 UTC] errnoent: "hits"
[2017-04-12 18:20:14 UTC] gilgameshxsaber: this new layout is ASS
[2017-04-12 18:20:17 UTC] anondublo1: Don't forget NMS
[2017-04-12 18:20:17 UTC] blue_blur64: Zelda, Persona 5 (which was no.1 in UK, very rare for a JRPG to do so), Horizon, Mass Effect (for some), etc
[2017-04-12 18:20:19 UTC] lioncock: you cant force him to have the same game tastes as you
[2017-04-12 18:20:25 UTC] anondublo1: the GOTY for 2016
[2017-04-12 18:20:28 UTC] eternia_forever: is there a game convention goin on or something with all this news you have coming @blue_blur64 ?
[2017-04-12 18:20:34 UTC] betheboom: silent we got max of 4 good games so far this year
[2017-04-12 18:20:37 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @Lioncock I'm not forcing him to do anything.
[2017-04-12 18:20:39 UTC] errnoent: Why do people insist that Horizon and Mass Effect are great games?
[2017-04-12 18:20:41 UTC] betheboom: persona crap
[2017-04-12 18:20:42 UTC] pcgamehunter: What Mass Effect, last one came out in 2012 ? Kappa
[2017-04-12 18:20:43 UTC] betheboom: nioh crp
[2017-04-12 18:20:47 UTC] gilgameshxsaber: Horizon is mediorcre at best
[2017-04-12 18:20:47 UTC] drzombius: Humble bundle has been my pal, just recently they had a ps4 bundle dspHmm dspGlitch
[2017-04-12 18:20:50 UTC] gilgameshxsaber: Mass effect is just bad

[2017-04-12 18:20:59 UTC] blue_blur64: Nioh is another one a lot of people like
[2017-04-12 18:20:59 UTC] goldencolts: red dead redemption 2 is going to be GOTY all the years and if you disagree you are WRONG
[2017-04-12 18:21:00 UTC] lioncock: mass effect is trash but i liked horizon, its the power of opinion and personal tastes
[2017-04-12 18:21:01 UTC] betheboom: horizon is good
[2017-04-12 18:21:02 UTC] codenameone: I don't really care about anything that's come out already. RE7 was the only game I cared about. The only other game coming out I care about is the Crash remaster.
[2017-04-12 18:21:02 UTC] anondublo1: I don't know about Horizon, but ME 2 was good.
[2017-04-12 18:21:02 UTC] eternia_forever: "people" @errnoent
[2017-04-12 18:21:07 UTC] betheboom: mass effect is good

[2017-04-12 18:21:47 UTC] gilgameshxsaber: no point in making RDR 2 it cant surpass the original
[2017-04-12 18:21:48 UTC] blue_blur64: It probably will. Rockstar is normally really good with making games
[2017-04-12 18:21:50 UTC] 0megaj0ker: wouldn't mind a Red Dead Replay :D
[2017-04-12 18:21:50 UTC] betheboom: pc im not fucking trolling
[2017-04-12 18:21:57 UTC] lioncock: i hope they dont overly focus on the online for RDR and not do any single player DLC
[2017-04-12 18:21:57 UTC] anondublo1: I'm really doubting it tbh. It's not going to be bad, but it's going to be boring.
[2017-04-12 18:21:58 UTC] betheboom: IM TELLING THE FACTS
[2017-04-12 18:22:09 UTC] lioncock: GTA V with no single player expansions made me sad
[2017-04-12 18:22:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :D bethe
[2017-04-12 18:22:11 UTC] anondublo1: Just like GTA 5.
[2017-04-12 18:22:17 UTC] gilgameshxsaber: You can tell they just making RDR 2 to delay for GTA 6
[2017-04-12 18:22:20 UTC] pcgamehunter: Oh so there really IS a blackhole in your brain, I'm sorry didn't mean to make fun of your disability

[2017-04-12 18:22:27 UTC] codenameone: If RDR2 has an online it will be ruined by Rockstar's greed just like how GTA Online was.
[2017-04-12 18:22:30 UTC] goldencolts: gta 4 only got expansions because microsoft gave them BIll gates money
[2017-04-12 18:22:31 UTC] blue_blur64: I still enjoy GTA V whenever I renew my PS+

[2017-04-12 18:22:48 UTC] errnoent: Please someone explain to me what makes Horizon a great game. It had a snooze of a plot, generic gameplay, not much else. Seeing that engine in action was cool..
[2017-04-12 18:22:49 UTC] betheboom: haha vidar
[2017-04-12 18:22:55 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm like the only member of the crew that was made for Phil that plays the game at all LUL

[2017-04-12 18:40:21 UTC] blue_blur64: I think the reason it's 7/7 is because that's the last day you can grab the treasure

[2017-04-12 18:41:15 UTC] drunkdriver1488: @blue_blur64 why does he not start at 11am anymore?
[2017-04-12 18:41:20 UTC] mythstorm24: It's Atlus Japan that doesn't want people to stream past 7/7
[2017-04-12 18:41:22 UTC] errnoent: Doesn't Atlus have a NA HQ?
[2017-04-12 18:41:23 UTC] azuredragoongx1: It's the epitome; the zenith of a love-hate relationship. :P

[2017-04-12 18:41:35 UTC] blue_blur64: That's just an estimate to start driver, not gameplay, just the stream itself
[2017-04-12 18:41:38 UTC] bigshatt: I just mute dsp until he loads the game
[2017-04-12 18:41:39 UTC] 1shenron: Motherflowers need too chill like this guy who's username is a blatant insult too Phil
[2017-04-12 18:41:43 UTC] drunkdriver1488: @blue_blur64 alright thanks

[2017-04-12 18:43:59 UTC] blue_blur64: Myth, the stream/video restrictions shouldn't keep people from buying the game

[2017-04-12 18:44:01 UTC] lioncock: i like yooka laylee but it has some technical issues and a wonky camera at times so there are legit criticisms
