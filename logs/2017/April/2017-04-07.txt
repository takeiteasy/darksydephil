[2017-04-07 18:01:55 UTC] masternutella: I just ordered chines food probably going to eat while watching the stream.
[2017-04-07 18:02:00 UTC] blue_blur64: Only sad news is that it's 2nd shift so I won't be here for weekday streams :(
[2017-04-07 18:02:04 UTC] betheboom: i say that delicious meal and cake yesterday
[2017-04-07 18:02:04 UTC] howlinthedeep: hi bethe

[2017-04-07 18:02:25 UTC] betheboom: silent :(
[2017-04-07 18:02:25 UTC] edicus: Phil is gonna be so confused tomorrow when he gets back to mass effect Andromeda why everyone isnt calling each other Sempai and theres a shocking lack of japan references haha
[2017-04-07 18:02:35 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I'm in the middle of watching Food Wars! :D
[2017-04-07 18:02:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: nice you got a job silent I remember you were saying a while ago that you just graduated and were on a job hunt
[2017-04-07 18:02:52 UTC] masternutella: I'm so hungry for food. lol
[2017-04-07 18:03:09 UTC] blue_blur64: Interesting thing about ME is that someone on twitter mentioned that there's more patches coming in the near future
[2017-04-07 18:03:20 UTC] betheboom: jimbob you watching ashleys final episode in emmerdale :(
[2017-04-07 18:03:24 UTC] masternutella: For mass effect?

[2017-04-07 18:04:18 UTC] masternutella: It is?

[2017-04-07 18:04:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: wow silent congrats that was good going
[2017-04-07 18:04:27 UTC] betheboom: jimbob what you mean you will, you mean you are
[2017-04-07 18:04:31 UTC] darksydephil: whoa
[2017-04-07 18:04:39 UTC] darksydephil: i dropped from over 270 subs to 256 today...
[2017-04-07 18:04:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I just switched over betheboom :P
[2017-04-07 18:04:44 UTC] miss_kelcher: whoa
[2017-04-07 18:04:45 UTC] darksydephil: so i guess a LOT of peopels subs expired
[2017-04-07 18:04:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: uhhhhhhhh
[2017-04-07 18:04:53 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, expect that to happen
[2017-04-07 18:04:54 UTC] howlinthedeep: wow
[2017-04-07 18:04:57 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Vetra is bae, but Cora got the booty B)
[2017-04-07 18:05:05 UTC] blue_blur64: People who use twitch prime can't do auto resubs
[2017-04-07 18:05:05 UTC] betheboom: daaaamn phil
[2017-04-07 18:05:12 UTC] edicus: some people rotate their twitch primes
[2017-04-07 18:05:22 UTC] blue_blur64: So they have to manually resub within 30 days or they start over
[2017-04-07 18:05:22 UTC] darksydephil: ok turning on the stream
[2017-04-07 18:05:24 UTC] edicus: i think im currently using my twitch prime here this month
[2017-04-07 18:05:37 UTC] betheboom: omega i had some asari ass and tits
[2017-04-07 18:05:44 UTC] blue_blur64: also rip seraphic
[2017-04-07 18:05:49 UTC] masternutella: I love how the host stream is completely frozen for me.
[2017-04-07 18:05:58 UTC] twitchnotify: 3 viewers resubscribed while you were away!
[2017-04-07 18:05:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: seraphic needs to do a redemption run
[2017-04-07 18:06:09 UTC] lvlpower: hello
[2017-04-07 18:06:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey lvlpower
[2017-04-07 18:06:19 UTC] kristiannox: Hello how is everyone today
[2017-04-07 18:06:20 UTC] mythstorm24: Hello
[2017-04-07 18:06:20 UTC] theycallmejimbob: we're live
[2017-04-07 18:06:23 UTC] edicus: ima be baking cookies and making pudding while the stream is going on today
[2017-04-07 18:06:26 UTC] 0megaj0ker: pretty much the romance scenes is where all the animation budget went instead of the faces Kappa
[2017-04-07 18:06:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: good thanks KristianNox and yourself
[2017-04-07 18:06:31 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey MythStorm24
[2017-04-07 18:07:28 UTC] lvlpower: @theycallmejimbob @kristiannox @mythstorm24 doing alright saw all the stuff on the new crazy
[2017-04-07 18:07:29 UTC] blue_blur64: alright, let's see how much the bits go today Kappa
[2017-04-07 18:07:37 UTC] darksydephil: so the good news is that twitch streaming has been very profitable so far this week and i hope to keep it at that level all month
[2017-04-07 18:07:55 UTC] darksydephil: the bad news is, even with the premiere of Persona 5, youtube was awful lol. it went up ever so slightly
[2017-04-07 18:07:56 UTC] 0megaj0ker: the bits is where is at
[2017-04-07 18:08:06 UTC] manyperegrine81: Hello hello hello everything.
[2017-04-07 18:08:08 UTC] darksydephil: youtube is pretty much dead at this point
[2017-04-07 18:08:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn one step forward two back and all that
[2017-04-07 18:08:16 UTC] blue_blur64: Honestly, I wouldn't expect youtube to get much better at this point
[2017-04-07 18:08:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey Many
[2017-04-07 18:08:21 UTC] manyperegrine81: Everyone**
[2017-04-07 18:08:26 UTC] zahvone: Howdy, everyone
[2017-04-07 18:08:32 UTC] jaxunhero: @darksydephil YouTube titanic is pretty much what's going on
[2017-04-07 18:08:34 UTC] jwalker70: perhaps everyday should now be double streams?
[2017-04-07 18:08:36 UTC] lvlpower: YouTube dropthe elevator
[2017-04-07 18:08:37 UTC] darksydephil: i see almost no reason to focus on anything over there. imagine if id sunk all of my time into KOGaming...id be super f'ed right now
[2017-04-07 18:08:45 UTC] masternutella: What happen to youtube man, used to be good in the old days
[2017-04-07 18:08:46 UTC] manyperegrine81: Sup Jimbob and @zahvone
[2017-04-07 18:08:51 UTC] zahvone: :D
[2017-04-07 18:08:52 UTC] blue_blur64: Like, none of the channels I currently watch have said anything that affected them negatively, so I'm glad about that
[2017-04-07 18:09:18 UTC] blue_blur64: Although one person who recently bought a new house before this youtube stuff happened is about to start recording again, so I hope things don't go bad for him
[2017-04-07 18:09:18 UTC] lvlpower: wow titanic
[2017-04-07 18:09:20 UTC] zahvone: @DarksydePhil If this continues, I can see big names coming over to Twitch. This is the opportunity Amazon / Twitch has been waiting for.
[2017-04-07 18:09:22 UTC] manyperegrine81: Never put all of your eggs in one basket. I learned that the hard way on 2012.
[2017-04-07 18:09:38 UTC] miss_kelcher: @blue_blur64 some people just aren't very open about that sort of thing
[2017-04-07 18:09:58 UTC] jaxunhero: Aside from Phil all other channels I follow are pretty much not saying anything negative oddly enough
[2017-04-07 18:10:01 UTC] edicus: I always felt like twitch's system was better. it promotes channel loyalty, provided the streamer can produce consisting content which...isnt that high effort considering its litterally just a live feed of gameplay XD
[2017-04-07 18:10:05 UTC] darksydephil: yeah it seems that the only way to keep afloat doing this kind of job now is with massive crowdfunding and/or moving to Twitch anda streaming focus. unless you're already on top on youtube, its impossible to keep going
[2017-04-07 18:10:32 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: My YouTube revenue went down 70%. The ads don't even show up any more
[2017-04-07 18:10:38 UTC] blue_blur64: Well I wouldn't say the ones I follow are on the top of youtube LUL
[2017-04-07 18:10:40 UTC] darksydephil: chances are you guys are following channels that have a huge following, in which case they probably went from making massive money to just okay money
[2017-04-07 18:10:54 UTC] zahvone: Well, this is true
[2017-04-07 18:11:08 UTC] zahvone: But the bigger channels already have HUUUUUGGGEE payouts from previous months and years so they'll be fine for now lol
[2017-04-07 18:11:09 UTC] howlinthedeep: Yeah everyones money has dropped on youtube
[2017-04-07 18:11:19 UTC] jaxunhero: @darksydephil probably game theory is pretty much monumental
[2017-04-07 18:11:23 UTC] darksydephil: stream working?
[2017-04-07 18:11:26 UTC] zahvone: Yes
[2017-04-07 18:11:27 UTC] edicus: yep
[2017-04-07 18:11:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yup
[2017-04-07 18:11:29 UTC] jaxunhero: Yes
[2017-04-07 18:11:31 UTC] miss_kelcher: like, every one I follow on youtube has made a video about their ad revenue being in the toilet
[2017-04-07 18:11:32 UTC] blue_blur64: Well the one that got the new house recently has 450k subs, but nobody else is close to that xD
[2017-04-07 18:11:35 UTC] edicus: playing the usual PS4 du du du du's
[2017-04-07 18:11:54 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it's probably why most youtube channels have a patreon now
[2017-04-07 18:12:06 UTC] darksydephil: let me put it this way. if a YT channel is making anywhere from 100k-500k total views a day, chances are they're not effected too badly by this
[2017-04-07 18:12:07 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: Hey Phil did you hear what YT did where only channels with over 10k views can monetize their videos now. I wish they would have made it at least 1 million views
[2017-04-07 18:12:12 UTC] lvlpower: I had to refresh
[2017-04-07 18:12:27 UTC] zahvone: I would imagine it might be a nice topic to talk about here on Twitch in the IRL section sometime soon, Phil. The "Great Youtube Depression" as it were.
[2017-04-07 18:12:42 UTC] darksydephil: right now on average im more in the 60k range so yeah, im definitely one of those that had to change to survive
[2017-04-07 18:12:49 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: Now they actually review your channel content if it's eligible for monetization also
[2017-04-07 18:13:08 UTC] darksydephil: ok im going to tweet that we're live
[2017-04-07 18:13:40 UTC] errnoent: what is up everyone
[2017-04-07 18:13:51 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Sup @errnoent
[2017-04-07 18:13:53 UTC] edicus: Guys, soft-set pudding is straight up witchcraft
[2017-04-07 18:13:55 UTC] jaxunhero: @darksydephil yea what @zahvone said could be a nice thing to do some time
[2017-04-07 18:14:01 UTC] edicus: its not natural
[2017-04-07 18:14:13 UTC] jwalker70: Phil would you consider taking one day a week to make a special YouTube video if you do double streams all week? That way you don't have to worry about it being successful
[2017-04-07 18:14:25 UTC] zahvone: :)
[2017-04-07 18:14:32 UTC] jaxunhero: @edicus you making pudding?
[2017-04-07 18:14:48 UTC] masternutella: I have not had pudding in years
[2017-04-07 18:14:55 UTC] masternutella: Kinda want to try em again
[2017-04-07 18:15:30 UTC] zahvone: Oh shit guys
[2017-04-07 18:15:43 UTC] edicus: @JaxunHero, yeah this oreo pudding, its just pudding mix, milk, stir, put in the fridge, somehow that turns into a pudding solid in around 10 minutes, Witchcraft I say
[2017-04-07 18:15:45 UTC] zahvone: How many of you enjoy cooking W/ the king?
[2017-04-07 18:15:48 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: Phil looks like a latino dude in that art xD
[2017-04-07 18:16:03 UTC] darksydephil: ok at the laptop now
[2017-04-07 18:16:11 UTC] manyperegrine81: @bestcompilationofficial That not true.
[2017-04-07 18:16:12 UTC] darksydephil: looks like everything is working so ill start in a sec here
[2017-04-07 18:16:20 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: I'm talking about this art
[2017-04-07 18:16:20 UTC] manyperegrine81: It was a misleading headline.
[2017-04-07 18:16:23 UTC] zahvone: @DarksydePhil If you ever do cooking with the king again? You should 100% get Blue Apron to sponsor those videos man.
[2017-04-07 18:16:34 UTC] odinedits1: !soap
[2017-04-07 18:16:35 UTC] nightbot: Handmade glycerin soaps and wax tart melts from DSP's girlfriend, Leanna! http://www.etsy.com/shop/theblackcurrant
[2017-04-07 18:16:44 UTC] tactical_twitch: This Is How You Don't Cook
[2017-04-07 18:16:48 UTC] masternutella: Phil making cake? I'd love to watch that Kappa
[2017-04-07 18:17:04 UTC] darksydephil: you guys forget the series was actually called POORLY cooking with the king lol
[2017-04-07 18:17:08 UTC] zahvone: I'm not even joking. This whole months I've been thinking of ways he might be able to monetize better to stay afloat
[2017-04-07 18:17:10 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: I'm not lying. https://9to5google.com/2017/04/06/youtube-partner-program-10k-lifetime-views/
[2017-04-07 18:17:11 UTC] nightbot: bestcompilationofficial -> Wake up, get up, get timed out! (Don't post links) [warning]
[2017-04-07 18:17:40 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: Oh sorry I just posted a link of the new monetization policies since someone said it wasn't true
[2017-04-07 18:17:40 UTC] b1gblack20: hey dsp when will you play KOF 14 again? there were 4 new characters released
[2017-04-07 18:17:41 UTC] howlinthedeep: poorly cooking that was a vintage series
[2017-04-07 18:17:48 UTC] edicus: Please @DarksydePhil you were just being modest Kappa
[2017-04-07 18:17:49 UTC] cherry_dood: Why is there always someone in here looking for Phil to cook?
[2017-04-07 18:17:50 UTC] zahvone: @DarksydePhil Yeah, and you could start it off with a small skit about how you failed at the cooking process - and then blue apron shows up and all of a sudden *voila*
[2017-04-07 18:17:54 UTC] manyperegrine81: And besides everyone's revenue is down. Even stars like PewDiePie. Then again, Game Theorists Matt sold out and call out Felix on his humor.
[2017-04-07 18:18:13 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: Pewdiepie only made $100 of ad revenue from 4 million views lol
[2017-04-07 18:18:14 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Matt started a global show last night
[2017-04-07 18:18:22 UTC] zahvone: @cherry_dood It's not specifically cooking - I'm just thinking of new means of monetizing.
[2017-04-07 18:18:24 UTC] zahvone: Hey Phil
[2017-04-07 18:18:32 UTC] recklessbiscuit1234: my boy philip
[2017-04-07 18:18:35 UTC] phoenixrising2015: He better be making some serious money if hes going to be traveling the world with 360 vr like he is\
[2017-04-07 18:18:38 UTC] blue_blur64: Good, excited to start making money soon :D
[2017-04-07 18:18:54 UTC] howlinthedeep: more persona 5 :D good game so far
[2017-04-07 18:19:04 UTC] codenameone: Seriously. I can't wait for ME to come back.
[2017-04-07 18:19:06 UTC] eternia_forever: bits for tits cheer50
[2017-04-07 18:19:09 UTC] edicus: still absoluty loving Persona 5
[2017-04-07 18:19:13 UTC] zahvone: Lol
[2017-04-07 18:19:17 UTC] manyperegrine81: PewDiePie destroyed the Pepsi Commercial. I love it
[2017-04-07 18:19:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: woo more Persona
[2017-04-07 18:19:25 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Yeah that secret game theory project may not work out right unless Youtube is sponsering it
[2017-04-07 18:19:28 UTC] masternutella: I haven't watched hes stream much cuz i've been busy so i don't even know whats going on in the game
[2017-04-07 18:19:33 UTC] masternutella: Kinda lost tbh lol
[2017-04-07 18:19:34 UTC] vlayer: Persona is absolutely great

[2017-04-07 18:19:36 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: When are you gonna play a non-JRPG game? lol
[2017-04-07 18:19:36 UTC] 007blaine: ceer45 you can do a full pt of persona 5 in may
[2017-04-07 18:19:36 UTC] kill3rmandreams: Hello everyone
[2017-04-07 18:19:42 UTC] zahvone: I'd rather you balance Persona and Danganronpa really
[2017-04-07 18:19:43 UTC] cherry_dood: ME:A was dead prior to the patch. Can't imagine it comes back too mainstream at this point.
[2017-04-07 18:19:44 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Vetra is Bae, but Cora got the booty B)
[2017-04-07 18:19:45 UTC] mattty3888: first person shooters only for me

[2017-04-07 20:09:24 UTC] shenmueps4: LOL seriously?
[2017-04-07 20:09:30 UTC] masternutella: It really is a joke but it's still rate like 8
[2017-04-07 20:09:31 UTC] shenmueps4: thats hilarious
[2017-04-07 20:09:32 UTC] 0megaj0ker: the spin-off is others describe it as a Saturday Morning Cartoon
[2017-04-07 20:09:32 UTC] masternutella: lol
[2017-04-07 20:09:48 UTC] pcgamehunter: LOL no, I don't fucking care about a SR spin off or whatever
[2017-04-07 20:09:49 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: Saints Row 2 was the best I think
[2017-04-07 20:09:56 UTC] phoenixrising2015: It was
[2017-04-07 20:09:57 UTC] shenmueps4: Kappa
[2017-04-07 20:10:03 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Saints row 3 was too small and short
[2017-04-07 20:10:08 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: they took it over the top after that
[2017-04-07 20:10:09 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and way too teasy
[2017-04-07 20:10:11 UTC] phoenixrising2015: *easy
[2017-04-07 20:10:25 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like the map was small
[2017-04-07 20:10:29 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The side stuff was fast
[2017-04-07 20:10:31 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: with aliens, lazer beams, alternate realities and really stupid shit
[2017-04-07 20:10:35 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and you could make fast money
[2017-04-07 20:10:37 UTC] shenmueps4: saints row 3 is fun that is all
[2017-04-07 20:10:49 UTC] pcgamehunter: You fools, Zinyak singing means SR4 is best SR
[2017-04-07 20:10:52 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Saints Row 3 is good for the insane moments in missions
[2017-04-07 20:11:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: like the first and second mission
[2017-04-07 20:11:11 UTC] phoenixrising2015: besides that it was just a game
[2017-04-07 20:11:39 UTC] thedemonkillerdante: SR2 is the best SR game.
[2017-04-07 20:11:39 UTC] masternutella: They can make saint row 5 if they wanted to
[2017-04-07 20:11:41 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Saints Row 3 is okay, but I wish I can play SR2 on PC, but Steam has a crappy port of it :(
[2017-04-07 20:11:43 UTC] masternutella: In space Kappa
[2017-04-07 20:12:00 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: The Hot fuzz missions in saints row 2 were so fun
[2017-04-07 20:12:02 UTC] shenmueps4: whats special about sr2
[2017-04-07 20:12:03 UTC] blue_blur64: Guys, who's excited for the Lords of Shadow Pachinko machine made by Konami? Kappa
[2017-04-07 20:12:04 UTC] masternutella: There is a fix for saint row 2 for steam version
[2017-04-07 20:12:05 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: I still have the game for ps3
[2017-04-07 20:12:15 UTC] masternutella: Not that hard
[2017-04-07 20:12:16 UTC] shenmueps4: @blue_blur64 me
[2017-04-07 20:12:19 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Yeah the true ending to saints Row 4 leaves open Saints Row 5
[2017-04-07 20:12:40 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But that would be insanely stupid too unless they went back to the roots of it being an arcadey GTA
[2017-04-07 20:12:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Thats why I liked Saints Row 2
[2017-04-07 20:12:52 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: blue blur, I have no idea, wtf dat is OpiOP
[2017-04-07 20:12:53 UTC] phoenixrising2015: GTA became way too realistic and serious
[2017-04-07 20:12:59 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: the septic missions too, XD
[2017-04-07 20:12:59 UTC] thedemonkillerdante: You had better customization, could replay missions and cutscenes in the cribs you bought, had fighting styles, and a lively city.
[2017-04-07 20:13:02 UTC] masternutella: I love how noone ever mention saint row 1
[2017-04-07 20:13:03 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Saints Row 2 was more arcadey like GTA 3 was
[2017-04-07 20:13:04 UTC] masternutella: Like
[2017-04-07 20:13:17 UTC] masternutella: It kinda looks like 2
[2017-04-07 20:13:31 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: the crib customization was really fun too. I like the feeling of taking over a city with your gang
[2017-04-07 20:13:35 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I miss the days when GTA was like an arcade game
[2017-04-07 20:13:41 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Now the game is like a real life sim
[2017-04-07 20:13:43 UTC] thedemonkillerdante: ^^
[2017-04-07 20:13:51 UTC] shenmueps4: gta vice city has the best setting of any gta game it is so beautiful and lively
[2017-04-07 20:13:57 UTC] thedemonkillerdante: ^
[2017-04-07 20:14:00 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Vice City was great
[2017-04-07 20:14:05 UTC] masternutella: Nah gta san andreas was the best
[2017-04-07 20:14:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: My favorite GTA
[2017-04-07 20:14:09 UTC] masternutella: The jetpack man
[2017-04-07 20:14:13 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Remember GTA 3 was suppose to have a mission to blow up a building, but was scrapped after 9/11, funny thing is that the mission provider still appears in the credits of the game.
[2017-04-07 20:14:14 UTC] thedemonkillerdante: San Andreas is king.
[2017-04-07 20:14:16 UTC] shenmueps4: san andreas was depressing
[2017-04-07 20:14:19 UTC] shenmueps4: to me
[2017-04-07 20:14:21 UTC] cm0n3ymillionair: aan andreas is too good
[2017-04-07 20:14:22 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: I like the gta vice city environment the most and the game mechanics/features of gta san andreas
[2017-04-07 20:14:34 UTC] thedemonkillerdante: Fuck Zero.
[2017-04-07 20:14:37 UTC] masternutella: Gta 3 was good but why was it so dark as hell
[2017-04-07 20:14:41 UTC] cm0n3ymillionair: you can actually swim in san andreas BibleThump
[2017-04-07 20:14:42 UTC] masternutella: Ny aint that dark
[2017-04-07 20:14:43 UTC] masternutella: lol
[2017-04-07 20:14:46 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: If the two could be combined that would be amazing
[2017-04-07 20:14:53 UTC] thedemonkillerdante: ^
[2017-04-07 20:14:56 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I remember playing Vice City, and sitting down in some location where no one would touch me, turning the car off, and just listening to all of VCPR
[2017-04-07 20:15:15 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey guys I am back.
[2017-04-07 20:15:26 UTC] pcgamehunter: so
[2017-04-07 20:15:29 UTC] masternutella: I love when you park the car right next to the mission just to listin to the great music
[2017-04-07 20:15:36 UTC] 0megaj0ker: wasn't there a cheat in Vice City that your car can turn into a boat or something? I cant remember.
[2017-04-07 20:15:39 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I would do that
[2017-04-07 20:15:41 UTC] akioartorius: hey derich
[2017-04-07 20:15:41 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Yes
[2017-04-07 20:15:43 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: The radio was hilarious. I remember a guy named Maurice Chavez or something like that
[2017-04-07 20:15:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You could make it hover
[2017-04-07 20:15:56 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You could get the Delorean car and use the cheat
[2017-04-07 20:15:59 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey @0megaj0ker @akioartorius @Phoenixrising2015 hows your friday been?

[2017-04-07 20:16:35 UTC] shenmueps4: DSP played vice city it was a good playthrough
[2017-04-07 20:16:37 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: Water was like sulfuric acid in gta vice city
[2017-04-07 20:16:42 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: lol
[2017-04-07 20:16:53 UTC] masternutella: I love how they give the Haitian leader huge titties
[2017-04-07 20:17:02 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: xD yeah she was crazy
[2017-04-07 20:17:07 UTC] masternutella: Shit is funny lol
[2017-04-07 20:17:07 UTC] thedemonkillerdante: Also Morgana is a male
[2017-04-07 20:17:10 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I remember doing the glitch for infinite ammo
[2017-04-07 20:17:13 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @Derichloveslemur right now I'm watching Shokugeki no Soma while waiting during the break.
[2017-04-07 20:17:36 UTC] akioartorius: are you saying that everyone in vice city are vampires? kappa
[2017-04-07 20:17:40 UTC] pcgamehunter: No morgana is car-gender
[2017-04-07 20:17:42 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You just kept doing the refill ammo cheat until it finally like went 00 or something and you had infinite ammo
[2017-04-07 20:17:45 UTC] derichloveslemur: Morgana is female @TheDemonKillerDante
[2017-04-07 20:17:49 UTC] twistedmetalkane: FUNgineer
[2017-04-07 20:17:51 UTC] pcgamehunter: respect vrm's pronouns
[2017-04-07 20:18:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The car repair saved me in missions so much
[2017-04-07 20:18:05 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: I just kept typing in the ammo cheat until I didn't have to worry about ammo ever again
[2017-04-07 20:18:20 UTC] akioartorius: Morgana is Hideoyoshi gender
[2017-04-07 20:18:20 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like when you had to take a certain car somewhere
[2017-04-07 20:18:21 UTC] masternutella: Gta 3 and vice city most common thing you see in the game, the zombie elvis news paper
[2017-04-07 20:18:44 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: So what's the name of the new Saints row knock off coming out?
[2017-04-07 20:18:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I remember the Patriot mission
[2017-04-07 20:18:51 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Would be pretty sweet if Phil played Simpsons: Hit & Run, that game is really good :D
[2017-04-07 20:18:53 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Thats where I used the cheat too
[2017-04-07 20:18:57 UTC] thedemonkillerdante: Nope, he has a female voice actress but in the original and Dub there's actually a conversation about the gender and Morgana gets pissed when you call him a female.
[2017-04-07 20:19:00 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Just kept repairing the car
[2017-04-07 20:19:05 UTC] cm0n3ymillionair: InuyoFace
[2017-04-07 20:19:07 UTC] shenmueps4: gta3 and gta vice city is pretty much the same aside from the fact its in a different setting? the gameplay is exactly the same
[2017-04-07 20:19:11 UTC] derichloveslemur: @TheDemonKillerDante ok lol
[2017-04-07 20:19:14 UTC] phoenixrising2015: No
[2017-04-07 20:19:18 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: Oh shit the simpsons hit and run was the first open world game I played as a kid. The memories
[2017-04-07 20:19:29 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Vice City had a bigger city, and more mechanics
[2017-04-07 20:19:38 UTC] phoenixrising2015: It also added shooting out tires
[2017-04-07 20:19:41 UTC] masternutella: Wait what
[2017-04-07 20:19:41 UTC] shenmueps4: everyone keeps talking about that game @bestcompilationofficial whats so good about it
[2017-04-07 20:19:42 UTC] masternutella: No
[2017-04-07 20:19:45 UTC] phoenixrising2015: It was more of an upgrade of GTA 3
[2017-04-07 20:19:46 UTC] masternutella: I think gta 3 was bigger
[2017-04-07 20:19:56 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015
[2017-04-07 20:20:06 UTC] shenmueps4: gta3 had three main areas and vice city only had 2
[2017-04-07 20:20:08 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I literally explored Simpsons: Hit & Run on foot, it was great
[2017-04-07 20:20:10 UTC] masternutella: yeah
[2017-04-07 20:20:16 UTC] phoenixrising2015: yeah but the two islands were huge
[2017-04-07 20:20:19 UTC] masternutella: Nah
[2017-04-07 20:20:22 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: It was the first game for me where you could go wherever you wanted and characters were just wandering around. It had cool collectibles and you could get a wanted level
[2017-04-07 20:20:23 UTC] masternutella: Pretty small
[2017-04-07 20:20:30 UTC] shenmueps4: they were small
[2017-04-07 20:20:35 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Let me check
[2017-04-07 20:20:43 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Phoenixrising2015 Vice city and San Andreas are the best.
[2017-04-07 20:20:53 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: I think it was the first game for me on the Ps2
[2017-04-07 20:21:09 UTC] 0megaj0ker: San Andreas is pretty much the King of GTA games
[2017-04-07 20:21:17 UTC] masternutella: ^
[2017-04-07 20:21:26 UTC] shenmueps4: for most people but for me its vice @0megaj0ker
[2017-04-07 20:21:36 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I'm looking at a map right now
[2017-04-07 20:21:43 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and they actually look like the games are the same size
[2017-04-07 20:21:49 UTC] derichloveslemur: @0megaj0ker how about vice city?
[2017-04-07 20:21:51 UTC] phoenixrising2015: GTA 3 had three islands
[2017-04-07 20:22:00 UTC] phoenixrising2015: but the two islands look like the three combined
[2017-04-07 20:22:08 UTC] cm0n3ymillionair: i wish las venturas was in gta V
[2017-04-07 20:22:10 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I think GTA 3 and Vice City are actually equal in size
[2017-04-07 20:22:14 UTC] cm0n3ymillionair: and san fierro
[2017-04-07 20:22:18 UTC] streetdojo: wtf did he eat? longest bathroom break ever

[2017-04-07 20:22:34 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: I remember I did a glitch where I crossed over that bridge before it was open in gta 3
[2017-04-07 20:22:42 UTC] shenmueps4: that was the good thing about san andreas, it was a huge map
[2017-04-07 20:22:42 UTC] howlinthedeep: Maybe this is his lunch break too
[2017-04-07 20:22:44 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: his birthday cake @Streetdojo ?

[2017-04-07 20:24:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I always wanted to get a helicopter after the opening of GTA SA and fly across the map just to see what would be highlighted or what would still be dark
[2017-04-07 20:24:13 UTC] 0megaj0ker: If Phil goes back to play San Andreas, he's going to replay the Flying School missions again :D
[2017-04-07 20:24:18 UTC] shenmueps4: it would all be highhlighted
[2017-04-07 20:24:20 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Who's your favorite tag team in WWE?
