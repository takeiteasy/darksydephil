[2017-04-16 20:27:25 UTC] phoenixrising2015: For the reasons I said before in that Sheamus is a total heel but plays by the rules, but when he gets to the point where hes just done, he just grabs a chair or something and hits people
[2017-04-16 20:27:26 UTC] vendatus: Braun better Kill Reigns again MingLee

[2017-04-16 20:28:45 UTC] vendatus: MingLee
[2017-04-16 20:28:49 UTC] phoenixrising2015: My idea for a Braun Moment is he attacks Roman
[2017-04-16 20:28:53 UTC] phoenixrising2015: They seem to seperate them
[2017-04-16 20:28:56 UTC] derichloveslemur: Like I said @Phoenixrising2015 Cesaro has always been my favorite wrestler

[2017-04-16 20:30:18 UTC] phoenixrising2015: lol

[2017-04-16 21:30:02 UTC] naddodr: Nightbot laying down the law
[2017-04-16 21:30:06 UTC] senjougaharasan5: Tbh I hope EA gets on bioware for doing this stuf
[2017-04-16 21:30:10 UTC] ugis900: so no one knows if he'll play persona over 7/7?
[2017-04-16 21:30:21 UTC] availableusername888: !thebot

[2017-04-16 21:30:26 UTC] alex_dragonul: It is much better imo
[2017-04-16 21:30:27 UTC] mummymama: but i is innocent
[2017-04-16 21:30:31 UTC] ugis900: ok
[2017-04-16 21:30:34 UTC] darthvidarviking: not as it is currently at least

[2017-04-16 21:30:45 UTC] wolfofthedawn: cheer30 well sadly i have to leave now, here som final bits hopefully this game can go out in a blaze of glory and not in disappointment anyways have a nice day phil
[2017-04-16 21:30:50 UTC] betheboom: in MY opinion mass effect 1 was the weakest of all the trilogy, the best was mass effect 2 and mass effect 3 in the middle. even though i like adromeda its still worse than 1
[2017-04-16 21:31:00 UTC] ugis900: guess i'll be watching someone else
[2017-04-16 21:31:20 UTC] availableusername888: watching someone else is waste of time
[2017-04-16 21:31:21 UTC] vendatus: For me my ranking is ME2 ,ME:A ,ME1, then ME3 SeemsGood
[2017-04-16 21:31:33 UTC] alex_dragonul: @betheboom yea i can see way ME1 might be
[2017-04-16 21:31:37 UTC] darthvidarviking: yeah @ugis900 phil won't risk it. To many haters :(

[2017-04-16 21:31:50 UTC] stevotatersdeep: If ya smeeeeeeeelllalalalalalalel what the rock is.............cookin!
[2017-04-16 21:31:54 UTC] betheboom: mass effect 1 was too short and mass effect 4 let me down with the ending
[2017-04-16 21:31:56 UTC] mummymama: you're all wrong
[2017-04-16 21:31:56 UTC] ugis900: well im not buying a ps4 so im gonna have to watch somebody
[2017-04-16 21:31:57 UTC] bentboxer: my favorite mass effect is mass effect andromeda, then mass effect 3, then mass effect 1, then mass effect 2
[2017-04-16 21:32:11 UTC] conky89: ME1 combat was kinda crap though
[2017-04-16 21:32:17 UTC] betheboom: 2 wasnt short and it didnt let me down
[2017-04-16 21:32:23 UTC] availableusername888: not buying ps4 is good choice tho, like not buying consoles at all
[2017-04-16 21:32:33 UTC] liesuponlies: How does Phil know its not the last stage
[2017-04-16 21:32:38 UTC] darthvidarviking: I think it is something like 18 days left ingame to he hits that date thouhg @ugis900
[2017-04-16 21:32:41 UTC] conky89: 2 was an improvement in combat but dumbed down in RPG mechanics
[2017-04-16 21:32:43 UTC] jdomican: error?
[2017-04-16 21:32:52 UTC] betheboom: andromeda was short and let me down more than 3
[2017-04-16 21:32:59 UTC] vendatus: Well Bethe the ending is a cliffhanger MingLee
[2017-04-16 21:33:02 UTC] mummymama: JAMAL

[2017-04-16 21:39:36 UTC] phoenixrising2015: They were shooting at you. My advice is to fire back, unless you are a Conscientious objector.
[2017-04-16 21:39:42 UTC] betheboom: jimbob you know those enemies which have blue smoke and disappear? yeah A BOSS one
[2017-04-16 21:39:43 UTC] clesstheangei: This game is great dude Kappa

[2017-04-16 21:40:44 UTC] availableusername888: he died they dojnt care
[2017-04-16 21:40:45 UTC] conky89: Maybe that is the punishment for trying to skip combat
[2017-04-16 21:40:46 UTC] 0megaj0ker: he has no helath

[2017-04-16 21:41:12 UTC] 0megaj0ker: his own dodge killed him?
[2017-04-16 21:41:13 UTC] snutte_0: there was nothing he could do!
[2017-04-16 21:41:14 UTC] mummymama: U JUS GOTTA BELIEVVVVVE

[2017-04-16 21:41:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: "just kill me"
[2017-04-16 21:41:18 UTC] salv88: does he have the fusion mod that makes you loose health when dashing?
[2017-04-16 21:41:20 UTC] mummymama: whaaaaaa
[2017-04-16 21:41:25 UTC] stormforcegamer: If you can't beat it... Skip it... Or glitch it.
[2017-04-16 21:41:33 UTC] liesuponlies: Yes, he has that chest mod that damages when he dashes on
[2017-04-16 21:41:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :D oh boy bethe what rating do you think he'll give this in his review
[2017-04-16 21:41:38 UTC] kurtkley: rate this game phyl please
[2017-04-16 21:41:40 UTC] liesuponlies: He forgot about
[2017-04-16 21:41:43 UTC] vendatus: Yes Salv88
[2017-04-16 21:41:45 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Ryder became a Conscientious objector and refused to fire his weapon anymore
[2017-04-16 21:41:46 UTC] betheboom: well not entire
[2017-04-16 21:41:49 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Hacksaw Andromeda
[2017-04-16 21:41:52 UTC] betheboom: but still
[2017-04-16 21:41:52 UTC] mummymama: Lol i ddin't "spam" haha wtf
[2017-04-16 21:41:57 UTC] kontheknight: how is Phil's business tonight?
[2017-04-16 21:42:07 UTC] clesstheangei: This game isn't higher than a 5/10 for me. Average
[2017-04-16 21:42:10 UTC] salv88: why would he have this mod if hes going to use dash?
[2017-04-16 21:42:11 UTC] betheboom: phil got so good bits today
[2017-04-16 21:42:19 UTC] availableusername888: cheer100 this game........
[2017-04-16 21:42:19 UTC] nightbot: availableusername888 -> It's not a game, I'm not a robot AI challenging you! (No excess symbols) [warning]
[2017-04-16 21:42:23 UTC] salv88: hes gonna die again
[2017-04-16 21:42:31 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn you Nightbot
[2017-04-16 21:42:33 UTC] availableusername888: nice.....
[2017-04-16 21:42:37 UTC] kurtkley: probably a solid 6 not much more
[2017-04-16 21:42:39 UTC] kontheknight: LOOOOL
[2017-04-16 21:42:42 UTC] mummymama: nightbot you need a snickers :/
[2017-04-16 21:42:42 UTC] conky89: This game does look playable but everything just comes off as unremarkable
[2017-04-16 21:42:50 UTC] kontheknight: Should they make a sequel to this shit
[2017-04-16 21:43:04 UTC] kurtkley: looks so clunky
[2017-04-16 21:43:25 UTC] betheboom: my average score is like a 8/10 , my good score is like a 9/10 and only perfection can beat that like uncharted 4 which was 10/10
[2017-04-16 21:43:29 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @kontheknight, They actually could due to the lore of what is going in on in this game. It would probably be depressing though
[2017-04-16 21:43:38 UTC] kovorus: Dope die mf die
[2017-04-16 21:43:53 UTC] betheboom: this is not the boss i mean BTW
[2017-04-16 21:43:59 UTC] vendatus: They already announced a sequel you'll see it at E3 Kappa
[2017-04-16 21:44:02 UTC] kurtkley: if this is 8/10 then ME2 wolud be 100/10 lol
[2017-04-16 21:44:05 UTC] betheboom: i forgot about that boss
[2017-04-16 21:44:13 UTC] conky89: if 8/10 is considered average, thank god we don't use that criteria in real life education. Many people would fail classes lol
[2017-04-16 21:44:16 UTC] codenameone: Hey guys, did I miss anything good?
[2017-04-16 21:44:22 UTC] availableusername888: nightbot stopped my cheer , so i guess thats timeout :)
[2017-04-16 21:44:34 UTC] darthvidarviking: everything @CodenameOne
[2017-04-16 21:44:47 UTC] mummymama: Nightbot me love you long time don't kill meee
[2017-04-16 21:45:00 UTC] kurtkley: looks like it was pretty rushed. but it took so long to develop ..
[2017-04-16 21:45:05 UTC] betheboom: mass effect 2 was a 9.5/10 it wasnt perfection sorry
[2017-04-16 21:45:14 UTC] betheboom: only bad thing i can say
[2017-04-16 21:45:22 UTC] conky89: Development hell my friend. Development hell...
[2017-04-16 21:45:28 UTC] kurtkley: perfection is like fallout 2
[2017-04-16 21:45:28 UTC] jmon_1985: Well a lot of jobs do cut off at the 8/10 3.0gpa average @conky89
[2017-04-16 21:45:29 UTC] codenameone: @darthvidarviking Minor salt? Full-blown rage?
[2017-04-16 21:45:30 UTC] kurtkley: a solid 10
[2017-04-16 21:45:39 UTC] clesstheangei: if me2 was a 9 then this game is at most a 4 or a 5 lol
[2017-04-16 21:46:13 UTC] vendatus: And here it comes this was my Oh Shit moment
[2017-04-16 21:46:31 UTC] betheboom: only REALLY BAD games get down too 4 or 5 in my book
[2017-04-16 21:46:32 UTC] naddodr: wait
[2017-04-16 21:46:39 UTC] betheboom: and this game was average
[2017-04-16 21:46:43 UTC] betheboom: so 8
[2017-04-16 21:46:45 UTC] 5of9: me:A Is exactly like me1. with better combat.
[2017-04-16 21:46:52 UTC] mummymama: 4 or 5 is average tho
[2017-04-16 21:46:54 UTC] clesstheangei: 5 = average.
[2017-04-16 21:46:59 UTC] conky89: 5/10 is average to me
[2017-04-16 21:47:01 UTC] clesstheangei: anything below is below average
[2017-04-16 21:47:04 UTC] betheboom: 6-7 is bad
[2017-04-16 21:47:11 UTC] mummymama: lol what?
[2017-04-16 21:47:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: this is my scaling system. If its playable and actually looks like effort was put in like this, Its about a 6/7
[2017-04-16 21:47:13 UTC] conky89: why?
[2017-04-16 21:47:14 UTC] betheboom: 8 is good
[2017-04-16 21:47:15 UTC] kurtkley: is not better..me 1 had much more role playing stuff
[2017-04-16 21:47:19 UTC] betheboom: 9 is great
[2017-04-16 21:47:23 UTC] betheboom: 10 is perfection
[2017-04-16 21:47:23 UTC] phoenixrising2015: If its something like Mindjack, then thats about a 2
[2017-04-16 21:47:28 UTC] gndorky: would absolutely not give this game an 8 lol
[2017-04-16 21:47:32 UTC] gndorky: 7 at best
[2017-04-16 21:47:33 UTC] kovorus: where's cherd
[2017-04-16 21:47:35 UTC] availableusername888: this game is 4/10 techically ok, but everything else is vomit
[2017-04-16 21:47:39 UTC] phoenixrising2015: thats how I am with movies too
[2017-04-16 21:47:41 UTC] mummymama: there is no such thing as a "perfect" game
[2017-04-16 21:47:43 UTC] betheboom: you gotta be unplayable to be a zero
[2017-04-16 21:47:47 UTC] bentboxer: what are you talking about this game is a 9.5 at least
[2017-04-16 21:47:53 UTC] conky89: Uncharted is not perfect
[2017-04-16 21:47:55 UTC] phoenixrising2015: If its a production movie, It automatically gets at least a 3 or 4
[2017-04-16 21:47:57 UTC] kurtkley: 9.5 out of 100
[2017-04-16 21:47:58 UTC] bentboxer: MEA Kreygasm
[2017-04-16 21:48:04 UTC] betheboom: barely a 8 this game
[2017-04-16 21:48:05 UTC] kontheknight: Uncharted is overrated
[2017-04-16 21:48:08 UTC] conky89: 9.99999999999999999/10
[2017-04-16 21:48:12 UTC] codenameone: @betheboom 6-7 being bad and 8 being average sounds like REALLY strict standards.
[2017-04-16 21:48:18 UTC] phoenixrising2015: If it looks like it was filmed in someone's backyard with a go pro then its a 1
[2017-04-16 21:48:19 UTC] salv88: keep dashing...
[2017-04-16 21:48:37 UTC] gndorky: it's actually the opposite of stict
[2017-04-16 21:48:38 UTC] kovorus: rush
[2017-04-16 21:48:40 UTC] gndorky: strict*
[2017-04-16 21:48:47 UTC] phoenixrising2015: As long as it has effort and actual productiion in it I will give it credit
[2017-04-16 21:48:48 UTC] gndorky: giving poor games like this an 8 is loose, not strict
[2017-04-16 21:48:50 UTC] clesstheangei: was about to say that lol
[2017-04-16 21:48:53 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Movie and game wise
[2017-04-16 21:49:05 UTC] betheboom: codename most games are inbetween 6 7 or 8

[2017-04-16 21:49:31 UTC] kovorus: Halo Kreygasm
[2017-04-16 21:49:49 UTC] haimenbusterx: Bugged halo
[2017-04-16 21:49:53 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Now take that game Magus. That looks like all they did was put some effort into making characters and that was it
[2017-04-16 21:49:56 UTC] betheboom: 9 and 10 have to be pretty damn EPIC
[2017-04-16 21:50:01 UTC] phoenixrising2015: That game got about a 3 out of ten from me
[2017-04-16 21:50:02 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I'm back from dinner, what did I miss?
[2017-04-16 21:50:07 UTC] butter__my__bread: his cod content was always amusing
[2017-04-16 21:50:16 UTC] betheboom: under 6 is REALLY BAD

[2017-04-16 21:50:35 UTC] mummymama: but 5 is average tho
[2017-04-16 21:50:36 UTC] senjougaharasan5: It amazes me how much they messed up the combat for mass effect in this game
[2017-04-16 21:50:39 UTC] betheboom: dont want to mention those

[2017-04-16 21:50:48 UTC] kovorus: Best online shooter imo
[2017-04-16 21:50:52 UTC] phoenixrising2015: If it amuses me and it looks like effort was put in, then its a thumbs up
[2017-04-16 21:50:55 UTC] conky89: Ironic the first game was called "Combat evolved" because the newer games certainly don't feel that way
[2017-04-16 21:50:57 UTC] tolomeor: this game is definitely game of the year
[2017-04-16 21:51:06 UTC] bentboxer: MEA > mass effect 1 2 3 combined

[2017-04-16 21:52:34 UTC] phoenixrising2015: And now for the Flood to arrive
[2017-04-16 21:52:39 UTC] mummymama: i wouldn't play this game even if you pay me
[2017-04-16 21:52:42 UTC] codenameone: It's gonna be depressing for Phil to review this because he loved to the original trilogy.
[2017-04-16 21:52:51 UTC] darthvidarviking: probably @kovorus
[2017-04-16 21:52:53 UTC] codenameone: This just doesn't live up to that standard.
[2017-04-16 21:52:59 UTC] availableusername888: @mummymama yeah, truew that
[2017-04-16 21:53:11 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Halo 6 needs The Flood back
[2017-04-16 21:53:15 UTC] butter__my__bread: this game is a cake walk. unless the finale winds him up i doubt theyll be much salt

[2017-04-16 21:53:31 UTC] liesuponlies: Normal in 2017 = Easy mode
[2017-04-16 21:53:34 UTC] kovorus: Halo 6 will probably be bundled with the Scorpio
[2017-04-16 21:53:38 UTC] clesstheangei: by salt i mean salt from the people who actually like this game
[2017-04-16 21:53:44 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like you are dealing with Cortana, and you find a hidden Flood storage
[2017-04-16 21:53:47 UTC] butter__my__bread: ah
[2017-04-16 21:53:50 UTC] betheboom: im not salty
[2017-04-16 21:53:50 UTC] conky89: Halo 3 was so obviously the ending for the series. But there was no way Microsoft was going to put their cashcow to rest
[2017-04-16 21:53:54 UTC] liesuponlies: Phil really should play on Harder modes, its more entertaining for everyone
[2017-04-16 21:53:55 UTC] betheboom: what you mean cless
[2017-04-16 21:54:03 UTC] clesstheangei: look up xD
[2017-04-16 21:54:30 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Of course they would have to flat out say "We got them all. No one was infected" to explain how the The Flood doesn't spread again
[2017-04-16 21:54:32 UTC] mummymama: phil change your shirt, aren't you soaking wet in that sweat?
[2017-04-16 21:54:40 UTC] clesstheangei: lol
[2017-04-16 21:54:53 UTC] conky89: They would need to make a serious asspull to bring the flood back
[2017-04-16 21:54:57 UTC] mummymama: i can smell you from here
[2017-04-16 21:55:16 UTC] conky89: Like Terminator 3 levels of asspull
[2017-04-16 21:55:29 UTC] availableusername888: mummymama gone full easy level troll
[2017-04-16 21:55:31 UTC] phoenixrising2015: They could say that there was a place they were sleeping that wasn't in the destroyed galaxy

[2017-04-16 21:55:44 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like you come across some place where they are hibernating

[2017-04-16 21:56:47 UTC] betheboom: aka kett
[2017-04-16 21:56:51 UTC] betheboom: and remnant
[2017-04-16 21:56:59 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Of course it can't be a lot and if they did bring the Flood back, it would need to be on an empty planet only with spartans on it to say no one got infected and spread it again
[2017-04-16 21:57:07 UTC] phoenixrising2015: so no rings need to be active
