[2017-04-13 03:46:24 UTC] anondublo1: @babymangaming21 no glitches, just awful performance Kappa
[2017-04-13 03:46:31 UTC] agentmainez: @allaspappa2 my point was, replacing Tracer with a Bastion makes it doable because unless you're freaking Soon odds are you arent a good enough Tracer to dish out the damage
[2017-04-13 03:46:43 UTC] babymangaming21: surprisingly, he hasn't teleported tonight. that's a shocker.
[2017-04-13 03:46:44 UTC] gamecapsule: They went to Phil? But I asked Twitch to send them to @YaCherdy and praised their graces.

[2017-04-13 03:47:27 UTC] allaspappa2: @agentmainez I'd say tracer is fine, but replace mercy with zen because the Discord is so fucking Kreygasm

[2017-04-13 03:47:38 UTC] anondublo1: I'm sure Phil will put it towards Cherdy's mod salary, don't worry.
[2017-04-13 03:47:42 UTC] butter__my__bread: wow bf1 only has 514 ppl watching it. game is dead already

[2017-04-13 03:48:14 UTC] agentmainez: @allaspappa2 but rez though.....
[2017-04-13 03:48:25 UTC] gamecapsule: Not PC. Better. Playstation 4.

[2017-04-13 03:49:42 UTC] bobbi_ling: oh his songs ...

[2017-04-13 03:49:55 UTC] babymangaming21: well he is losing so this is a L
[2017-04-13 03:49:58 UTC] itstommytakeover: if phil went orisa again this would be a little easier. Extra shields are key
[2017-04-13 03:50:10 UTC] bobbi_ling: what does the fox say FailFish
[2017-04-13 03:50:20 UTC] gamecapsule: Symmetra needs to be up in there setting traps behind them.
[2017-04-13 03:50:24 UTC] allaspappa2: The meta for this one on the hardest is Orisa, Zen, Bastion and Rein
[2017-04-13 03:50:27 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @YaCherdy what's his youtube name, the same or different
[2017-04-13 03:50:33 UTC] anondublo1: someone pass panda the controller, phil isn't cut out for this tonight Kappa
[2017-04-13 03:50:35 UTC] agentmainez: @allaspappa2 true true, but mercy does out heal zen normally and her damage boost does the same as discord stick that on the your DPS and its basically the same thing
[2017-04-13 03:50:36 UTC] bobbi_ling: witch doctor theme FailFish

[2017-04-13 03:51:07 UTC] allaspappa2: @agentmainez Na, discord is better because both orisa and bastion deals more damage mercy can only boost 1

[2017-04-13 03:53:02 UTC] agentmainez: @allaspappa2 i assumed we would still have a tracer,torb, and rein on the team. but with an orisa and bastion yeah discord would do more than mercy
[2017-04-13 03:53:04 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Why the fuck are you talking shit about him. You're going to judge him by the shit he says over the computer rofl

[2017-04-13 18:06:45 UTC] betheboom: i did get a disc copy
[2017-04-13 18:06:46 UTC] codenameone: ME1's main quest is kind of short too. There's just Noveria, Feros, Virmire, Ilos, and then the end.
[2017-04-13 18:06:49 UTC] betheboom: hmmmm
[2017-04-13 18:07:04 UTC] darksydephil: yeah ME1 is actually a pretty short game if you dont die much
[2017-04-13 18:07:16 UTC] yacherdy: ME1 main story can be done fast but its all about that full experience
[2017-04-13 18:07:16 UTC] darksydephil: but it was the first in a series, and they were doing something totally new/different
[2017-04-13 18:07:16 UTC] zahvone: mmmmm
[2017-04-13 18:07:22 UTC] ratchefan12: hey jimbob wisper me

[2017-04-13 18:08:02 UTC] darksydephil: wtf is the stream working?
[2017-04-13 18:08:03 UTC] vezvor: Hey Phil are you going to be playing Tekken 7, or have you given up on fighting games?
[2017-04-13 18:08:05 UTC] betheboom: codename with mass effect 1 they were testing the waters, then mass effect 2 came along and they threw everything into that....they did the same with mass effect 3 and then ruined the ending
[2017-04-13 18:08:06 UTC] yacherdy: yes
[2017-04-13 18:08:07 UTC] codenameone: @DarksydePhil Yeah. Nowadays if a game's short it's just not worth a full $60. Especially if the game itself just isn't *good*. Like Andromeda.
[2017-04-13 18:08:26 UTC] betheboom: then of course a newb dev team started on andromeda
[2017-04-13 18:08:26 UTC] darksydephil: stream was showing as live, now it says it sdown
[2017-04-13 18:08:27 UTC] darksydephil: wtf

[2017-04-13 18:08:38 UTC] codenameone: Everything's working here.
[2017-04-13 18:08:56 UTC] darksydephil: so the stream IS live for you then?
[2017-04-13 18:08:56 UTC] betheboom: codename is has fun and good parts cahman

[2017-04-13 18:09:39 UTC] yacherdy: nothing you can say will make him unhate it
[2017-04-13 18:09:42 UTC] codenameone: I'm sorry. I adored the original trilogy. I own the first two books. This shit is just...horrible.
[2017-04-13 18:09:43 UTC] yacherdy: its his persona
[2017-04-13 18:10:00 UTC] rbreezay: Mass Effect!
[2017-04-13 18:10:03 UTC] yacherdy: Well I'm not accusing you codename, its your opinion.
[2017-04-13 18:10:09 UTC] betheboom: codename made by different people maybe
[2017-04-13 18:10:15 UTC] betheboom: have you played it codename?
[2017-04-13 18:10:22 UTC] darksydephil: yeah sadly andromeda doesn't hold a candle to any of ht eoriginal 3 games. its just comes up horrendously short
[2017-04-13 18:10:26 UTC] rbreezay: I still haven't finished Pok√©mon Sun and Mass Effect Andromeda
[2017-04-13 18:10:43 UTC] liesuponlies: ME1 has aged like shit
[2017-04-13 18:10:45 UTC] betheboom: new devs people THEY TRIED
[2017-04-13 18:10:56 UTC] rbreezay: To much sidequest.
[2017-04-13 18:10:59 UTC] codenameone: @betheboom I don't fucking care if they "tried". They failed.

[2017-04-13 18:11:27 UTC] codenameone: @liesuponlies Agreed. ME1's gameplay is HORRIBLE. The Benezia fight is still broken.
[2017-04-13 18:11:31 UTC] yacherdy: eternia hates it
[2017-04-13 18:11:31 UTC] betheboom: cherdy yes :(
[2017-04-13 18:11:32 UTC] liesuponlies: combat in ME1 is horrible, i did a Triology run last year by far bad

[2017-04-13 20:37:39 UTC] thepastryarchy: I think after the Peebee mission, you should head into the main story ... unless you want to 100% several planets by way of Nomad, which is easily another 6 hours per planet :D. Frankly, I wouldn't mind seeing what would happen if you completed the main story without completing all planets like I did.

[2017-04-13 20:39:00 UTC] hapticbabyman: yeah, probably best to finish the main story after this mission. Unless some of those other side missions are REALLY good.
[2017-04-13 20:39:08 UTC] betheboom: my fave armor is N7 might not be that good but its classic

[2017-04-13 20:45:20 UTC] errnoent: on one hand I feel sorry for Phil having to scrutinize his bit cheering performance like that, just to make enough to get by. on the other hand that's not really how it's supposed to work. sometimes I think Phil should just take what he can get and realize it's not going to be a ton
[2017-04-13 20:45:28 UTC] betheboom: bammbino likes it though

[2017-04-13 22:18:50 UTC] yacherdy: I actually prefer F3 to New Vegas but its close

[2017-04-13 22:18:55 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Nathan Drake was annoying as hell
[2017-04-13 22:19:01 UTC] howlinthedeep: no uncharted 4 was 11/10
[2017-04-13 22:19:03 UTC] bammbino: @Royal_Phalanx91, it was bad enough that they stopped making ac games til they can think of a way to bring it back to its standards^

[2017-04-13 22:19:56 UTC] vendatus: Uncharted 4 is a 5 same old shit Uncharted 2 best in the series
[2017-04-13 22:20:02 UTC] codenameone: I "like" Fallout 3, but most of that is nostalgia. It's one of the worst RPGs; too linear, predetermined backstory, can only play for one faction, very poor character building, etc.
[2017-04-13 22:20:09 UTC] bammbino: @errnoent, nathan is written like that AND his voice actor nolan north is like that so it flows
[2017-04-13 22:20:20 UTC] royal_phalanx91: During cora sex scene, seriously just shut the fuck up goofy ryder

[2017-04-13 22:20:34 UTC] veronix_x: I think Obidisian is making new Fallout, but its not confirmed yet, just speculations
[2017-04-13 22:20:45 UTC] betheboom: and i have never felt that way about any game before or since
[2017-04-13 22:20:47 UTC] royal_phalanx91: They are? who said that?
[2017-04-13 22:20:53 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, i know why you dont like this game, its because troy baker isnt ryder
[2017-04-13 22:20:57 UTC] veronix_x: Internet. :D
[2017-04-13 22:20:58 UTC] errnoent: Bammbino I think they go a little over the top with it but it does add some cheer to the game. I like Uncharted series a lot though
[2017-04-13 22:21:00 UTC] veronix_x: just Google. :D
[2017-04-13 22:21:09 UTC] yacherdy: is it your favorite game of all time bethe?
[2017-04-13 22:21:18 UTC] codenameone: @Veronix_x Bethesda should just GIVE Fallout to Obsidian, but it hurts Todd Howards wittle baby feewings to know Obsidian's Fallout shits all over his fucking garbage.
[2017-04-13 22:21:20 UTC] royal_phalanx91: When I played uncharted I just wanted drake to shut the hell up for once
[2017-04-13 22:21:21 UTC] vendatus: Uncharted 4 wasn't necessary it was a cash grab
[2017-04-13 22:21:28 UTC] vendatus: Kappa

[2017-04-13 22:21:40 UTC] bammbino: uncharted 4 was a send off

[2017-04-13 22:21:48 UTC] royal_phalanx91: "writing"*
[2017-04-13 22:21:48 UTC] 562801: @Vendatus how was it a cash grab
[2017-04-13 22:21:49 UTC] bammbino: naughty dog devs dont wanna keep making it
[2017-04-13 22:21:50 UTC] hapticbabyman: II though you hated Troy Baker?

[2017-04-13 22:22:05 UTC] errnoent: Yeah I agree with deep
[2017-04-13 22:22:09 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, it was sarcasm on both my end and his
[2017-04-13 22:22:12 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Preston Bradley
[2017-04-13 22:22:14 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Bammbino It's just kind of a really odd send-off in terms of story
[2017-04-13 22:22:14 UTC] yacherdy: cool bethe
[2017-04-13 22:22:20 UTC] veronix_x: They should. :)
[2017-04-13 22:22:23 UTC] vendatus: Uncharted 3 was the perfect end to the series
[2017-04-13 22:22:27 UTC] imaidenr: @Vendatus, wasnt necessary really? you can never have too much fun right?
[2017-04-13 22:22:27 UTC] betheboom: uncharted made its curtain call
[2017-04-13 22:22:27 UTC] tourwithme: Trademark Scarf indoors
[2017-04-13 22:22:39 UTC] betheboom: hope lost legacy is just as good
[2017-04-13 22:22:58 UTC] hapticbabyman: It had none of the supernatural element the other games had. If they wanted to do some meta commentary on the supernatural stuff just being whatever Drake and co. fed into the story, they should've done a better job
[2017-04-13 22:22:59 UTC] betheboom: alredy got it pre ordered
[2017-04-13 22:23:01 UTC] betheboom: :D
[2017-04-13 22:23:12 UTC] codenameone: I couldn't finish Uncharted 3. Its story is a carbon copy of Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade.
[2017-04-13 22:23:14 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, the directors and producers AND writers made the last of us.. that amy lady wanted to keep writing uncharted but the employees were done
[2017-04-13 22:23:14 UTC] veronix_x: Uncharted DLC will be great! for sure.
[2017-04-13 22:23:21 UTC] errnoent: I used to pre-order games back when they were good and worth pre-ordering

[2017-04-13 22:24:07 UTC] hapticbabyman: They should've let Amy write it @Bammbino . The initial trailer hinted at a better story. But yeah, I get what you mean. Working on the same thing over and over will get REALLY tiring.
