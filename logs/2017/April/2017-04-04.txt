[2017-04-04 17:50:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Speaking of Nintendo Phil will have to take back calling the nintendo switch archaic it's up there with samsung and apple with it very own bendgate :P

[2017-04-04 17:51:50 UTC] dragonjarvis: I actually think that in its current state the switch is archaic, because the OS of the switch still has not the features which even last gen consoles have, like achievement system, chatsystem, browser, multimedia apps and so on =/ I hope all those things will arrive later this year though
[2017-04-04 17:52:19 UTC] errnoent: Well jimbob bendgate was a result of physical stress, Nintendo Switch is just deforming due to heat

[2017-04-04 17:55:08 UTC] dragonjarvis: @theycallmejimbob No, because all those stuff I mentioned. I will hold off until it has all the stuff I mentioned because to me, If I would buy the Switch now would be useless because I still have to wait for so much stuff. I will buy the switch maybe at the end of the yeah with mario oddysey, I bet they will make that a holiday bundle and I think by the end of the year the OS will have a ton of more features. I also wish for themes like on the 3ds .

[2017-04-04 17:59:50 UTC] dragonjarvis: @theycallmejimbob year exactly. who knows when more games are out, maybe nintendo will become smart enough to bundle the switch with a preinstalled game and an micro sd card? atleast 64gb sd card plus preinstalled game on it would sound to me better then the current switch version

Sharing is currently blocked through the native PS4 UI. However, if you do plan on streaming, video guidelines above apply except length. If you decide to stream past 7/7 (I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT DOING THIS, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED), you do so at the risk of being issued a content ID claim or worse, a channel strike/account suspension.

[2017-04-04 21:00:18 UTC] mizorelover: You can change to Direct Commands as soon as you can pause the game or mid-battle. Also, the major personas are based off of famous historical people. Morgana's is Zorro, actually.

[2017-04-04 21:06:19 UTC] mightysandwich: This soundtrack might be worth buying on its own

[2017-04-04 21:07:17 UTC] ornightz: It's Like Atlus want you to play the game and don't want you to play it at the same time
[2017-04-04 21:07:25 UTC] vendatus: WutFace
[2017-04-04 21:07:32 UTC] donniedarksouls: the question is, which tab does he masturbate to?
[2017-04-04 21:07:33 UTC] expicell: Ppl enjoy watching Phil rage but he doesn't realize that
[2017-04-04 21:07:53 UTC] vince329: @Ornightz It's more like, If you don't mind streaming the game then you won't be affected by these copyright policies at all
[2017-04-04 21:07:55 UTC] jwalker70: what did I miss?
[2017-04-04 21:07:55 UTC] igoturcorona: Atlus just dont wanna spoil the came for the hardcore fans they aren't as big so they are protecting there fanbase
[2017-04-04 21:07:58 UTC] beanie5181: that farn art is scary lol
[2017-04-04 21:07:58 UTC] vendatus: he does LUL

[2017-04-04 21:08:02 UTC] expicell: I think the tab that Leanna is on
[2017-04-04 21:08:03 UTC] mightysandwich: They didn't want anyone streams VF or uploading the story mode of a Guilty Gear Xrd either.
[2017-04-04 21:08:08 UTC] ornightz: Pretty certain that atlus thread is trollbait
[2017-04-04 21:08:12 UTC] igoturcorona: They dont care about the gaijin way of things
[2017-04-04 21:08:24 UTC] mightysandwich: anyone streaming or uploading*
[2017-04-04 21:08:27 UTC] terranines: Well, they sure enough want you to play it instead of watch it. They block the game from streaming through the PS4's streaming function, at least
[2017-04-04 21:08:44 UTC] vince329: Japanese developers have a view that they want everyone to experience the product by themselves and compromise by looking at someone else play. Especially when it comes to story based games because the story is the most important parts
[2017-04-04 21:08:50 UTC] expicell: Atlus is a cocksucket like Kojima
[2017-04-04 21:08:51 UTC] terranines: Doesn't stop those with a capture card of course
[2017-04-04 21:08:53 UTC] vince329: Atlus and Nintendo exemplify this to its maximum
[2017-04-04 21:09:01 UTC] jwalker70: I would stream if they didn't block ps4 sharing features
[2017-04-04 21:09:02 UTC] idragonish: 15 minute is like 15x the amount of time Phil needs to cum
[2017-04-04 21:09:19 UTC] expicell: Phil hates Kojima and atlus #charmsalt
[2017-04-04 21:09:20 UTC] anondublo1: western streaming elitists feeling like they're above copyright laws Kappa
[2017-04-04 21:09:27 UTC] rbreezay: Phil works a 4 hour shift with 2 breaks. Hmmmm
[2017-04-04 21:09:37 UTC] vince329: An exempt from this would be a developer such as Platinum Games, where story is not the main focus and pure action takes forefront.
[2017-04-04 21:09:49 UTC] vince329: Or unless you're Yoko Taro who just doesn't give a damn
[2017-04-04 21:10:05 UTC] ornightz: The game released late how they fc'kn know nobody watched the JPN version of the whole playthrough
[2017-04-04 21:10:08 UTC] expicell: Phil works 4 hours streaming plus 3 hours video uploading
[2017-04-04 21:10:20 UTC] rbreezay: Kojima and Atlus Vs Phil Burnell and a mystery partner
[2017-04-04 21:10:42 UTC] rbreezay: Book it

[2017-04-04 21:34:11 UTC] hapticbabyman: It's like buying a music album, sampling a sound byte, then putting it in your track and monetizing your song w/o paying royalties to the original artist
[2017-04-04 21:34:12 UTC] darthvidarviking: Making a case against let's plays saying it is illigal is a stupid case to make. If you think that. Stop viewing

[2017-04-04 21:35:25 UTC] ornightz: @Vince329 that right there is the problem , it's like Atlus expects an Overnight conversion to Persona titles

[2017-04-04 21:35:54 UTC] hapticbabyman: you buy the song just to listen to it; if you want to sample it w/o making money from w/e song you put the sample in you can do that under fair use. But if you want to make money from the song w/ the sample in it, you have to pay licensing fees to the original artist or whoever holds the rights to that song, or they'll sue you. It's the same thing w/ Let's Plays tbh
[2017-04-04 21:36:08 UTC] gilgameshxsaber: If you dont understand how a lets play makes a game a transformative work then you dont understand copyright period
[2017-04-04 21:36:11 UTC] eternia_forever: SERIOUS question for everyone what the fuck is with ps4 game disc coming flopping around loose in sealed new game case, who else is having this issue when getting ps4 game ???

[2017-04-04 21:36:35 UTC] beanie5181: morgana's prefered pronoun is she/her Keepo
[2017-04-04 21:36:35 UTC] vince329: @Ornightz well it's Atlus, they have a very large fanbase already, so they designed it for that fanbase. Anyone else that does get converted by chance is just more power to them. Which is stupid I know.
[2017-04-04 21:36:38 UTC] blue_blur64: eternia, I don't know what the issue is, it happened with all of the PS4 games I got for Christmas

[2017-04-04 21:36:56 UTC] hapticbabyman: @gilgameshxsaber I'm talking about the player's assumed right to make money off their playthrough of the game, not simply if it's transformative
[2017-04-04 21:36:56 UTC] bobbi_ling: hes probably fapping over some wrestler

[2017-04-04 21:37:40 UTC] radicalenzyme: Restart phil you missed a cutscene
[2017-04-04 21:37:47 UTC] doctorzzz: rip
[2017-04-04 21:37:59 UTC] errnoent: @Mr___Bungle Ok, I understand how making a profit can change things. But I feel like that's not a strong argument. Twitch is also taking a cut from the streamer and watching a stream is not the same as playing the game or "consuming" that content.
[2017-04-04 21:38:04 UTC] drilbit777: morgana is a male lol its just that they used a female VA to make him sound younger
[2017-04-04 21:38:09 UTC] anondublo1: c'mon eternia/vidar whip out those wallets
[2017-04-04 21:38:13 UTC] doctorzzz: male female is all the same in japan
[2017-04-04 21:38:15 UTC] jackythefrost: @Ornightz Atlus handles games in a way that only their fanbase will like. They dont give a shit about anyone else

[2017-04-04 21:39:00 UTC] ornightz: Morgana is a girl cat
[2017-04-04 21:39:02 UTC] eternia_forever: pisses me off when buying a ps4 game online and the 1st fucking thing i hear before even opening box or envelope is hearing the game disc bouncing around loose inside box = dspAngrydsp dspAngrydsp dspAngrydsp

[2017-04-04 21:39:04 UTC] mr___bungle: But pubs give permission to twitch, they control it. Atlus is simply limiting their product, and have every right to.
[2017-04-04 21:39:08 UTC] yacherdy: Stupid high schoolers yelling by my window
[2017-04-04 21:39:10 UTC] yacherdy: Shut up

[2017-04-04 22:27:27 UTC] errnoent: @YaCherdy Nah dude they're totally fine for that. Actually there was a case regarding terrorism a while back that involved PIA and the FBI went to get a subpoena but it was useless because PIA just stated they don't store logs.

[2017-04-04 22:29:25 UTC] jackythefrost: Persona 5 started partial development in 2010 but didnt start full development until 2012
