[2017-04-24 17:48:04 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I've only beaten Dragon Armor solo once
[2017-04-24 17:48:05 UTC] ratchefan12: those dang kids on the prestrea yesterday
[2017-04-24 17:48:07 UTC] yacherdy: My channel probably would have gotten taken down
[2017-04-24 17:48:27 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Never beaten Twin Princes solo, Nameless King or Cinder
[2017-04-24 17:48:45 UTC] yacherdy: Just a heads up: Today's chat will be a mess.
[2017-04-24 17:48:50 UTC] yacherdy: :D
[2017-04-24 17:48:55 UTC] phoenixrising2015: When is it not
[2017-04-24 17:48:59 UTC] yacherdy: well.,...
[2017-04-24 17:49:07 UTC] phoenixrising2015: "Don't make me shut the chat down"
[2017-04-24 17:49:09 UTC] yacherdy: especially today
[2017-04-24 17:49:17 UTC] ratchefan12: why whats up
[2017-04-24 17:49:28 UTC] yacherdy: Phil is going to "hang out" in the chat today
[2017-04-24 17:49:32 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Really
[2017-04-24 17:49:38 UTC] yacherdy: after he beats Yooka
[2017-04-24 17:49:41 UTC] phoenixrising2015: *sighs*
[2017-04-24 17:49:49 UTC] ratchefan12: so sick of people like fred fuches stealing phils vids
[2017-04-24 17:49:49 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Well. O
[2017-04-24 17:49:51 UTC] darthvidarviking: how long you think he have left guys?
[2017-04-24 17:49:52 UTC] yacherdy: so it's gonna be filled with fans and trolls alike
[2017-04-24 17:49:58 UTC] darthvidarviking: I am not a expert in this franchise
[2017-04-24 17:50:20 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Phil might as well not finish Persona 5 on stream
[2017-04-24 17:50:24 UTC] yacherdy: not sure vidare
[2017-04-24 17:50:26 UTC] yacherdy: vidar*
[2017-04-24 17:50:33 UTC] yacherdy: why phoenix
[2017-04-24 17:50:42 UTC] phoenixrising2015: By the time he gets around by it its going to be non caring by people
[2017-04-24 17:50:42 UTC] ratchefan12: cuz of the damn haters
[2017-04-24 17:50:47 UTC] darthvidarviking: is this guy serious with the lore?
[2017-04-24 17:50:54 UTC] darthvidarviking: or is he just fucking around
[2017-04-24 17:51:03 UTC] yacherdy: nothing wrong with a lore whore vidar :D
[2017-04-24 17:51:11 UTC] darthvidarviking: no not at all
[2017-04-24 17:51:15 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like its already being shown completed
[2017-04-24 17:51:22 UTC] darthvidarviking: I just wonder if it is real or some thing he makes up
[2017-04-24 17:51:28 UTC] yacherdy: But I have no idea what he's talking about
[2017-04-24 17:51:30 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Phil won't attract people with it
[2017-04-24 17:51:55 UTC] darthvidarviking: this guy being dyslectic sounded oddly too spesific or whatever for this
[2017-04-24 17:52:17 UTC] yacherdy: well based on the cheers/tips during the Persona streams, he'll most likely stream it based on that. People probably want to see his ending to it.
[2017-04-24 17:52:19 UTC] phoenixrising2015: that freaking shield
[2017-04-24 17:52:54 UTC] yacherdy: but we'll see what happens in June/July or whatever it is.
[2017-04-24 17:52:59 UTC] phoenixrising2015: At least here it gives you an open arena to fight him
[2017-04-24 17:53:00 UTC] ratchefan12: cherdy i tipped the most during the persona stream actually
[2017-04-24 17:53:03 UTC] phoenixrising2015: unlike the normal game
[2017-04-24 17:53:08 UTC] yacherdy: @ratchefan12 well there you go
[2017-04-24 17:53:09 UTC] phoenixrising2015: where it keeps you trapped
[2017-04-24 17:53:33 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Thats probably the biggest problem
[2017-04-24 17:53:44 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You are in a small area compared to this
[2017-04-24 17:53:49 UTC] phoenixrising2015: can go off the edge
[2017-04-24 17:53:53 UTC] yacherdy: this guy is good at dodging
[2017-04-24 17:53:57 UTC] yacherdy: better than I would be
[2017-04-24 17:54:03 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and are essentially in a small hallway compared to this open area
[2017-04-24 17:54:23 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Even dodging in that area is hard for me
[2017-04-24 17:54:34 UTC] yacherdy: must play the series a lot
[2017-04-24 17:54:35 UTC] ratchefan12: kind of nervous to play dark souls but if phil can beat the games so can i
[2017-04-24 17:54:42 UTC] yacherdy: I've only played Demon's and Dark Souls
[2017-04-24 17:54:58 UTC] yacherdy: @ratchefan12 so just have to practice it to get better
[2017-04-24 17:55:03 UTC] yacherdy: you* not so
[2017-04-24 17:55:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Also he has a move where he sends a shockwave at you
[2017-04-24 17:55:13 UTC] yacherdy: It's like homework
[2017-04-24 17:55:24 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and since you are in a small confined area
[2017-04-24 17:55:30 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You need to move fast
[2017-04-24 17:55:36 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Here you just can run around
[2017-04-24 17:56:46 UTC] ratchefan12: boogie is just aas awesome as phil in my opinion
[2017-04-24 17:57:13 UTC] darthvidarviking: they are so opposite though
[2017-04-24 17:57:25 UTC] ratchefan12: that is true
[2017-04-24 17:57:43 UTC] ratchefan12: but id still like to meet them both
[2017-04-24 17:58:08 UTC] ratchefan12: if phil ever goes to pax west i nseattle id like to meet him

[2017-04-24 17:59:56 UTC] darthvidarviking: I have memory like a goldfish
[2017-04-24 18:00:21 UTC] bethebaby: @YaCherdy No, but I'm eager to see the 60 days end because I know EXACTLY what my next username will be(spoiler alert: it'll still be trolling BeThe).
[2017-04-24 18:00:28 UTC] yacherdy: uh oh

[2017-04-24 18:04:29 UTC] darksydephil: no, im going to finish up the stuff in the final world and maybe even backtrack a bit now that i have all of the powers
[2017-04-24 18:04:41 UTC] darthvidarviking: right
[2017-04-24 18:05:11 UTC] yacherdy: Sounds like maybe a 2-2 and a half hour hour adventure. SeemsGood
[2017-04-24 18:05:16 UTC] yacherdy: who knows..
[2017-04-24 18:05:42 UTC] ratchefan12: @DarksydePhil i might not be there for the hangout i have to work today
[2017-04-24 18:06:11 UTC] yacherdy: Hope my contact phones me about that marijuana trimming job
[2017-04-24 18:06:14 UTC] yacherdy: :D
[2017-04-24 18:06:23 UTC] bethebaby: Good thing I already worked today; now I get to watch Phil all day! Kappa
[2017-04-24 18:06:23 UTC] darthvidarviking: are you kidding ?
[2017-04-24 18:06:28 UTC] yacherdy: no?
[2017-04-24 18:06:38 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Its funny that Shinada is supposed to be in debt in Yakuza 5 but I already have enough to pay off his loan 1 chapter in
[2017-04-24 18:06:43 UTC] darthvidarviking: so you are going to be a mariuahna trimmer?
[2017-04-24 18:06:54 UTC] darksydephil: ok stream will be live shortly
[2017-04-24 18:07:02 UTC] yacherdy: Well yes if all things work out and might counter balance it with another job
[2017-04-24 18:07:04 UTC] azuredragoongx1: @Phoenixrising2015 If only we could get something like Tales of Xillia 2 in it xD
[2017-04-24 18:07:23 UTC] darthvidarviking: sounds like a very special job. had a friend working as a marihuana ligher or some sick shit like that in amsterdam. But still a weird job. But they do excist i suppose
[2017-04-24 18:07:41 UTC] yacherdy: lel
[2017-04-24 18:08:03 UTC] darksydephil: we're down to 218 subs :(
[2017-04-24 18:08:09 UTC] yacherdy: hey it pays well and I have OCD so cutting off leaves sounds like a job for me.
[2017-04-24 18:08:10 UTC] darthvidarviking: :C
[2017-04-24 18:08:10 UTC] darksydephil: the lack of new releases this month really killed it
[2017-04-24 18:08:14 UTC] yacherdy: I'll take whatever I can get it.
[2017-04-24 18:08:15 UTC] darksydephil: hopefully next month we boost up again
[2017-04-24 18:08:29 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Seriously. *Gets Gold Plate once I can go into stores* Oh, 100,000 yen. Wheres that guy I owe money to at?
[2017-04-24 18:08:29 UTC] bethebaby: Can someone please explain to me what Seraphic is talking about? Gwyn getting her tits milked at a factory farm to suck all the lore out or some shit?!
[2017-04-24 18:08:38 UTC] yacherdy: @bethebaby whaaa
[2017-04-24 18:08:41 UTC] yacherdy: DBstyle
[2017-04-24 18:08:55 UTC] ratchefan12: @DarksydePhil keep your chin up phil i will defiently re sub next month
[2017-04-24 18:09:18 UTC] roubador: @DarksydePhil That seems to be a common tale among streamers.
[2017-04-24 18:09:24 UTC] darthvidarviking: It seem like he is to oddly spesific. It's a reason it is good to diversify
[2017-04-24 18:09:39 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Gameplay and Story Segregation sometimes makes weird results
[2017-04-24 18:10:22 UTC] yacherdy: Well that's the thing about Twitch Prime, after the free month or whatever people don't want to renew.
[2017-04-24 18:10:49 UTC] darthvidarviking: It's Phil time!
[2017-04-24 18:10:50 UTC] bethebaby: @YaCherdy It's free every month with Prime.
[2017-04-24 18:10:52 UTC] yacherdy: Just the nature of the bidness
[2017-04-24 18:10:56 UTC] yacherdy: @bethebaby wait what.
[2017-04-24 18:11:00 UTC] yacherdy: Okay I'm just stupid.
[2017-04-24 18:11:02 UTC] yacherdy: Moving on.
[2017-04-24 18:11:10 UTC] darthvidarviking: you get one free sub or whatever
[2017-04-24 18:11:20 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Yeah I use mine every month to get dark souls emotes
[2017-04-24 18:11:51 UTC] ratchefan12: #fuckatlus
[2017-04-24 18:12:02 UTC] yacherdy: 7/7 ruined my life.
[2017-04-24 18:12:20 UTC] ratchefan12: #FuckAtlus #Persona5

[2017-04-24 18:13:21 UTC] xeranarth: 7/7 is really a weird date. Nothing even happens until 9/11 in P5.
