[2017-04-23 18:02:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: beginners trap
[2017-04-23 18:02:07 UTC] bethebaby: dspNothing
[2017-04-23 18:02:08 UTC] yacherdy: I still think Phil should do something for charity but I know that he already explained why.
[2017-04-23 18:02:50 UTC] bentboxer: phil already having financial troubles taking care of himself right now... he should recieve charity instead of give it
[2017-04-23 18:03:04 UTC] bethebaby: He does receive charity though Kappa
[2017-04-23 18:03:09 UTC] yacherdy: Well even so nothing wrong about donating to charity
[2017-04-23 18:03:30 UTC] yacherdy: But I think he said he doesn't want to do it publicly.
[2017-04-23 18:03:50 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I think's it good that in America they disclose what percentage goes to the actual cause I wish charities here would do that
[2017-04-23 18:03:58 UTC] bentboxer: i give two dollars to bums and salvation army bell ringers
[2017-04-23 18:03:59 UTC] betheboom: i remember a group of people doing 24 hour stream for charity and they had goals, one guy got waxed, another got he hair dyed pink and beard dyed blond, another had to swear for the very first time on videa, they all played Balsamic vinaigrette Pong and more
[2017-04-23 18:04:20 UTC] yacherdy: I say Phil should shave his head and goatee

[2017-04-23 18:07:02 UTC] darksydephil: you can't help it anymore, it'll happen forever as long as game companies provide copies early and continue to support the insane practice of early reviews
