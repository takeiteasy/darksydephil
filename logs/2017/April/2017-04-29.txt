[2017-04-29 23:04:46 UTC] blue_blur64: But their ultimate personas are mythical beings
[2017-04-29 23:05:12 UTC] pcgamehunter: @blue_blur64 Oh I meant they're based on some other character, just didn't know how to phrase it. and I was talking about the persona's that aren't unique to each game :)
[2017-04-29 23:05:31 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh, well my statement is still true :P
[2017-04-29 23:05:38 UTC] pcgamehunter: true

[2017-04-29 23:06:16 UTC] pcgamehunter: Although arsene isn't real tho is he ?
[2017-04-29 23:06:36 UTC] blue_blur64: so it looks like I'm gonna have to do a 3rd playthrough to get the all max confidant achievement
[2017-04-29 23:06:41 UTC] blue_blur64: And arsene is real
[2017-04-29 23:07:04 UTC] blue_blur64: Arsene Lupin
[2017-04-29 23:07:11 UTC] pcgamehunter: I thought he was a thief from a novel
[2017-04-29 23:07:22 UTC] blue_blur64: Ok, well real as in not mythical
[2017-04-29 23:07:26 UTC] pcgamehunter: Oh
[2017-04-29 23:07:31 UTC] pcgamehunter: So not real
[2017-04-29 23:07:38 UTC] pcgamehunter: but not a mythical just fictional
[2017-04-29 23:08:02 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, I guess saying fictional would be better than saying real for their personas
[2017-04-29 23:08:29 UTC] pcgamehunter: rite gotcha
[2017-04-29 23:08:55 UTC] blue_blur64: And now to wait for the chat jukebox to begin D:
