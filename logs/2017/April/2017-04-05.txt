[2017-04-05 01:55:44 UTC] blue_blur64: It's a lot of fun so far
[2017-04-05 01:57:37 UTC] retrothicc2b: phil turok 2 seeds of evil is on steam, i think it would be a worthy game to put up for vote as a viewers choice. just an idea.
[2017-04-05 01:57:56 UTC] retrothicc2b: course persona 5 is more well enough to hold me over
[2017-04-05 01:58:51 UTC] darksydephil: ad revenue dropped on youtube again, lol
[2017-04-05 01:59:19 UTC] darksydephil: my views went up and my ad revenue went down. makes perfect sense
[2017-04-05 01:59:28 UTC] retrothicc2b: copyright fault or the partnership?
[2017-04-05 01:59:29 UTC] miss_kelcher: well, shit
[2017-04-05 01:59:44 UTC] darksydephil: its youtubes fault
[2017-04-05 01:59:52 UTC] miss_kelcher: that sucks :/
[2017-04-05 01:59:56 UTC] retrothicc2b: well, course that's a given
[2017-04-05 02:00:08 UTC] darksydephil: at least this month ill get credit for everything though. i got zero credit for anythign zelda in march
[2017-04-05 02:00:13 UTC] ghandi101: how does this keep happening?
[2017-04-05 02:00:19 UTC] darksydephil: hopefully since ill be getting paid for every view in april it'll make up for it
[2017-04-05 02:00:22 UTC] retrothicc2b: wow that sucks, u put a lot time into zelda
[2017-04-05 02:00:37 UTC] ghandi101: I would have flipped out already if I were you
[2017-04-05 02:00:42 UTC] retrothicc2b: zelda did fetch some bits though

[2017-04-05 02:01:27 UTC] eternia_forever: @RetroTHICC2B hey man
[2017-04-05 02:01:33 UTC] darksydephil: sadly today's 1st stream of Persona 5 didn't do so well
[2017-04-05 02:01:35 UTC] darksydephil: hoping that hcanges
[2017-04-05 02:01:36 UTC] darksydephil: changes
[2017-04-05 02:01:52 UTC] retrothicc2b: i know not much cheerin but it is a 200 part game lol
[2017-04-05 02:02:03 UTC] retrothicc2b: plenty time
[2017-04-05 02:02:05 UTC] eternia_forever: phil lower the on screen notice from 500 to 200 - 250 @DarksydePhil
[2017-04-05 02:02:25 UTC] eternia_forever: imo
[2017-04-05 02:02:29 UTC] garlicshrimp: 200-250 too easy though
[2017-04-05 02:02:37 UTC] eternia_forever: not so much
[2017-04-05 02:03:16 UTC] miss_kelcher: well, 250 bits is roughly $4, right?
[2017-04-05 02:03:23 UTC] eternia_forever: i feel that will keep detractors away but still allow people that want the pop ups to bid as well
[2017-04-05 02:03:29 UTC] 0megaj0ker: still here B)
[2017-04-05 02:03:42 UTC] darksydephil: by the way, nothing was instantly claimed by Atlus but i didn't expect it to be
[2017-04-05 02:03:51 UTC] darksydephil: we'll see what happens with the YT vids over the next few days
[2017-04-05 02:03:56 UTC] dragonjarvis: well lowering the amount people need to cheer would be a good idea if you do it step by step, because the more you advance in the game, less and less spoilers can happen. I think. but that is just an idea
[2017-04-05 02:03:58 UTC] darksydephil: so i hope people watch ASAP just in case
[2017-04-05 02:04:00 UTC] eternia_forever: sigh
[2017-04-05 02:04:27 UTC] darksydephil: ok gonna start up the 2nd stream for tonight!

[2017-04-05 02:04:50 UTC] garlicshrimp: phil could you place the face cam not directly in the middle?
[2017-04-05 02:05:02 UTC] darksydephil: garlic there doesn't seem to be ANY place that's good placement
[2017-04-05 02:05:04 UTC] jlawlar: sojiro looks like doctor venture
[2017-04-05 02:05:06 UTC] darksydephil: there's shit everywhere lol
[2017-04-05 02:05:09 UTC] garlicshrimp: lol
[2017-04-05 02:05:17 UTC] miss_kelcher: what about middle left?
[2017-04-05 02:05:19 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah xD
[2017-04-05 02:05:29 UTC] blue_blur64: Middle left would block the commands for battles
[2017-04-05 02:05:33 UTC] darksydephil: i can try middle left but that blocks out text from onscreen discussions i thik
[2017-04-05 02:05:33 UTC] dragonjarvis: you know what would be cool, If phil could make like a greenscreen behind him and put his face where dumasses hp bar is xD
[2017-04-05 02:05:35 UTC] garlicshrimp: or just block most of the date lol
[2017-04-05 02:05:37 UTC] miss_kelcher: oh, shoot
[2017-04-05 02:05:40 UTC] eternia_forever: just place it directly in the center middle of the screen and be done with it
[2017-04-05 02:05:52 UTC] miss_kelcher: ^
[2017-04-05 02:05:53 UTC] garlicshrimp: block most of the date except the month?
[2017-04-05 02:06:06 UTC] blue_blur64: Ooh, if that was possible that'd be pretty cool xD
[2017-04-05 02:06:45 UTC] eternia_forever: i will do it my way

[2017-04-05 19:32:19 UTC] betheboom: gino still comes here he just watches other streams more
[2017-04-05 19:32:22 UTC] podusmonens: maybe, bobbi. or maybe he got tired of deleting bethe

[2017-04-05 22:05:36 UTC] hapticbabyman: It's actually a good thing b/c it means as long as you keep the MC alive the other party members can tank what you want them to tank
[2017-04-05 22:05:38 UTC] amplifyed: go another day

[2017-04-05 22:05:47 UTC] realazyria: because you walked right passed a safe room
[2017-04-05 22:05:48 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: :p
[2017-04-05 22:05:50 UTC] kushiyakitori: These dungeons aren't meant to be done in one day
[2017-04-05 22:05:57 UTC] vendatus: BabyRage
[2017-04-05 22:06:01 UTC] hapticbabyman: You only have to prioritize one party member if it comes down to it, instead of everybody
[2017-04-05 22:06:04 UTC] marktactics: Exactly
[2017-04-05 22:06:14 UTC] euffy: I did this without any big issues on the first day.
[2017-04-05 22:06:16 UTC] metarrixxxx: @errnoent shin megami are different than persona but they're identical with the battle system and on other points
[2017-04-05 22:06:16 UTC] anondublo1: @KushiYakitori this is phil we're talking about, he's gotta try to brute force it forty times then blame the game when it doesn't work out
[2017-04-05 22:06:21 UTC] amplifyed: You skipped a safe room, aren't returning when you need to- you can't do this in one day
[2017-04-05 22:06:31 UTC] marktactics: You have 14 days for a reason
[2017-04-05 22:06:33 UTC] kushiyakitori: @anondublo1, thats true.
[2017-04-05 22:06:41 UTC] anondublo1: MingLee
[2017-04-05 22:06:43 UTC] akioartorius: Only 10 days left
[2017-04-05 22:06:59 UTC] metarrixxxx: @errnoent but u really have to like JRPG and farming exp in dungeons to really appreciate the whole content
[2017-04-05 22:07:23 UTC] errnoent: @metarrixxxx Idk.. I thought FF8 was really fun and that required a fuckton of grinding IIRC
[2017-04-05 22:07:23 UTC] phoenixrising2015: My personal problem with these games is the downtime inbetween dungeon crawling
[2017-04-05 22:07:48 UTC] hapticbabyman: @metarrixxxx not all JRPGs are like that. Panzer Dragoon Saga doesn't require farming. But it's pretty short for a JRPG and kind of on the easier side as well.
[2017-04-05 22:07:53 UTC] anondublo1: for me it's the dungeon crawling, too repetitive for me
[2017-04-05 22:07:59 UTC] metarrixxxx: @errnoent lol u just have to steal 100 of each magic and u're good
[2017-04-05 22:08:01 UTC] amplifyed: waiting for him to continue ignoring chat and going again without saving , and dying once more
[2017-04-05 22:08:05 UTC] amplifyed: Then blame the game
[2017-04-05 22:08:12 UTC] anondublo1: not just the combat system, but the music too, hearing this shit over and over again would drive me crazy
[2017-04-05 22:08:13 UTC] realazyria: this is why i told you on twitter safe when you can.. don't skip a safe room. i did that and lost 3 hours because i got lost in the story. but i'm glad i did
[2017-04-05 22:08:15 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like I have heard the first 2 Personas are more dungeon crawly but if they made a Persona game like this with you just exploring dungeons I would be down with it
[2017-04-05 22:08:17 UTC] ufccurbstomp: so he is on normal, right?
[2017-04-05 22:08:25 UTC] jaxunhero: Yep
[2017-04-05 22:08:27 UTC] metarrixxxx: @hapticbabyman I never tried Panzer Dragoon I'd like to some day
[2017-04-05 22:08:28 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I honestly tried with Persona 3. I really did. I just couldn't do it
[2017-04-05 22:08:28 UTC] realazyria: save*
[2017-04-05 22:08:30 UTC] kushiyakitori: @ufccurbstomp, yes
[2017-04-05 22:08:44 UTC] dspfandood: Phenix play SMT then
[2017-04-05 22:08:53 UTC] shockstorm: DSP a big warning do not wait til final day for boss fight of dungeon when you go to set the card it forces you to wait until next day to finish the dungeon/fight boss
[2017-04-05 22:08:57 UTC] hapticbabyman: @metarrixxxx It's incredible, but I've only played the first disc :(. They need to re-release it or remake it some day
[2017-04-05 22:08:59 UTC] shockstorm: So do it third to last to be safe
[2017-04-05 22:09:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Yeah I have Nocturne and DDS 1 and 2 to download
[2017-04-05 22:09:08 UTC] amplifyed: if you only want dungeon crawling just play w core SMT game
[2017-04-05 22:09:11 UTC] vendatus: I say leave and buy items MingLee
[2017-04-05 22:09:12 UTC] mrmittensthefluffycat: persona 3 on the psp is good
[2017-04-05 22:09:13 UTC] shockstorm: Ah nocturne is great loev that game
[2017-04-05 22:09:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I got them during that super sale where they were all like 1 dollar
[2017-04-05 22:09:14 UTC] amplifyed: There's minimal down time
[2017-04-05 22:09:24 UTC] metarrixxxx: @hapticbabyman but it has a shoot'em up side as well ? it's not all JRPG
[2017-04-05 22:09:25 UTC] amplifyed: SMT 3 is amazing
[2017-04-05 22:09:26 UTC] errnoent: @metarrixxxx I can see games like SMT:N being fun but I do really prefer JP action games like MGR, Vanquish, FGs, etc.
[2017-04-05 22:09:33 UTC] bobbi_ling: ba dum dum, ba dm ba doo
[2017-04-05 22:09:34 UTC] dragonjarvis: gg
[2017-04-05 22:09:39 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Phoenixrising2015 Don't know about the 1st one but the 2nd one (particularly Eternal Punishment) is very dungeon-heavy and the later dungeons are very difficult
[2017-04-05 22:09:40 UTC] miss_kelcher: succubus
[2017-04-05 22:09:41 UTC] akioartorius: cheer10 you have 10 days left to do the dungeon so you don't have to rush through it. Your bullets and sp will refresh after you leave. Just be careful
[2017-04-05 22:09:49 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @errnoent you must love Nier Automata then

[2017-04-05 22:10:06 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Yeah those seem like my type of RPG. Thanks guys and @hapticbabyman
[2017-04-05 22:10:11 UTC] marktactics: Wait
[2017-04-05 22:10:12 UTC] realazyria: he loved it
[2017-04-05 22:10:15 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: have to give bit to tell him, eh @akioartorius
[2017-04-05 22:10:18 UTC] errnoent: @ufccurbstomp Not buying it. Not into the style/story and the combat is lame/easy compared to MGR
[2017-04-05 22:10:20 UTC] hapticbabyman: @metarrixxxx Yeah Saga's the only JRPG; the others are rail shooters. But Saga has a battle system mostly like the rail shooters and it's very unique
[2017-04-05 22:10:21 UTC] jelsea1973: Use Hold ups to get Muscle milk from horses so you can heal the whole party without using sp
[2017-04-05 22:10:23 UTC] amplifyed: he enjoyed w3 but hated the combat
[2017-04-05 22:10:27 UTC] marktactics: Did he just threw away Izanagi?
[2017-04-05 22:10:28 UTC] bobbi_ling: he didnt love it he said the combat sucks
[2017-04-05 22:10:30 UTC] imaidenr: @RealAzyria, SeemsGood
[2017-04-05 22:10:39 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @errnoent Your loss
[2017-04-05 22:10:40 UTC] imaidenr: combat was fine imo
[2017-04-05 22:10:46 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Phoenixrising2015 np
[2017-04-05 22:10:52 UTC] metarrixxxx: @errnoent well if u like action JP games go ahead :) I dont mind aha
[2017-04-05 22:10:55 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But yeah, that PSN sale was insane. I saw someone but like a ton of the SMT games and a few others and saved like 50 dollars due to the discounts making them like 1.24 cents american
[2017-04-05 22:11:08 UTC] phoenixrising2015: *buy
[2017-04-05 22:11:11 UTC] doctorzzz: CURSE
[2017-04-05 22:11:12 UTC] jelsea1973: Use R1 to auto go to the weakness
[2017-04-05 22:11:14 UTC] doctorzzz: FailFish
[2017-04-05 22:11:30 UTC] akioartorius: it was kinda stupid to throw away izanagi after you summoned him for free
[2017-04-05 22:11:31 UTC] bobbi_ling: there was a psn sale? dspHmm
[2017-04-05 22:11:33 UTC] metarrixxxx: @hapticbabyman but did u play it on Saturn ?
[2017-04-05 22:11:38 UTC] phoenixrising2015: It was a few months ago
[2017-04-05 22:11:57 UTC] phoenixrising2015: All the SMT games were like 1-4 dollars
[2017-04-05 22:12:02 UTC] betheboom: bobbi there is a 8 years of ps plus sale
[2017-04-05 22:12:15 UTC] metarrixxxx: @hapticbabyman I never find a Saturn emulator which is working correctly..
[2017-04-05 22:12:18 UTC] bobbi_ling: why would i buy 8 years?
[2017-04-05 22:12:22 UTC] knoxfast: What is this for?
[2017-04-05 22:12:39 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I got Noctune and DDS 1 and 2 for like 9 dollars. They just didn't download for some reason when I told them to on the PSN store website
[2017-04-05 22:12:42 UTC] hapticbabyman: @metarrixxxx I played it on SSF. But, when I tried switching discs it crashed my computer and I'd have to do a system restore. Might be a virtual drive issue. SSF is your best bet tho just test out a few different virtual drivers and see which is best for your setup
[2017-04-05 22:12:45 UTC] errnoent: Why are there no more excellent PS4 games coming out this year guys :(
[2017-04-05 22:12:59 UTC] bobbi_ling: i dont plan to stick with sony for 8 years lol. im only here for the fighters this gen
[2017-04-05 22:13:03 UTC] somethingyer2: e3 is right around the corner errnoent
[2017-04-05 22:13:03 UTC] betheboom: bobbi i mean for ps plus members you get a discount to celebrate 8 years of ps plus
[2017-04-05 22:13:10 UTC] hapticbabyman: You have to get some old DirectX codecs too and install them but it's pretty easy to do that part
[2017-04-05 22:13:16 UTC] bobbi_ling: oh
[2017-04-05 22:13:16 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @errnoent we don't know that yet
[2017-04-05 22:13:17 UTC] jelsea1973: This is a special mob
[2017-04-05 22:13:24 UTC] amplifyed: Detroit and god of war may be coming out , plus there's still e3
[2017-04-05 22:13:36 UTC] metarrixxxx: @hapticbabyman ok cool ! thanks for the tip ! I'd like to try Burning Rangers as well on Saturn aha
[2017-04-05 22:13:39 UTC] jiv_: is phil calling out all the donations/cheers and stuff during cutscenes?
[2017-04-05 22:13:53 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @errnoent besides, this year has been so front-loaded with great games - we have been super spoiled
[2017-04-05 22:14:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Ok this mechanic seems like you are dangerous
[2017-04-05 22:14:03 UTC] errnoent: @ufccurbstomp ??? Like what?
[2017-04-05 22:14:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: You beat them so bad they beg to join or flee
[2017-04-05 22:14:16 UTC] bobbi_ling: psn should be free. its not as good as xbl
[2017-04-05 22:14:18 UTC] ewojo: cheer20 Hey Phil if you hold up enemies who you already have personas for will give you items.
[2017-04-05 22:14:25 UTC] jelsea1973: Save room is close
[2017-04-05 22:14:29 UTC] amplifyed: people always act like if games come out early in the year no games have released
[2017-04-05 22:14:33 UTC] hapticbabyman: @metarrixxxx same here; I haven't touched SSF in a while tho, probably won't until I can make sure there's no compatibility issues.
[2017-04-05 22:14:35 UTC] howlinthedeep: Don't skip the save room this time
[2017-04-05 22:14:42 UTC] amplifyed: You wer at another save room b for
[2017-04-05 22:14:48 UTC] amplifyed: You skipped it
[2017-04-05 22:14:49 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @errnoent Nioh, Nier, DS3 DLC, Horizon, P5, etc
[2017-04-05 22:14:55 UTC] realazyria: you skipped it
[2017-04-05 22:14:56 UTC] garlicshrimp: where the fuck is the treasure
[2017-04-05 22:15:06 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Seriously, this has been a STRONG first quarter
[2017-04-05 22:15:12 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Yakuza Kiwami
[2017-04-05 22:15:18 UTC] errnoent: @ufccurbstomp Horizon is not an excellent game dude. Nioh's alright, Nier's ok. Maybe I need to lower my standards :(
[2017-04-05 22:15:20 UTC] amplifyed: If you literally hate every release the system has had then there's no saving you
[2017-04-05 22:15:21 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Thats coming out this year I think
[2017-04-05 22:15:27 UTC] amplifyed: But don't act like nothing has come out
[2017-04-05 22:15:31 UTC] amplifyed: A shit ton has
[2017-04-05 22:15:34 UTC] bobbi_ling: niohs above alright
[2017-04-05 22:15:34 UTC] errnoent: @amplifyed nothing excellent
[2017-04-05 22:15:35 UTC] realazyria: sombody needs to tell him that in a tip or something, you don't see it in the chat
[2017-04-05 22:15:43 UTC] amplifyed: plenty excellent
[2017-04-05 22:15:48 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Phoenixrising2015 not quite; you can fight them, or try to recruit them as Personas. You can also enter contracts with them for items and stuff. It's basically like the demon recruiting system from SMT but simplified.
[2017-04-05 22:16:03 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Oh my mistake. Thank you
[2017-04-05 22:16:05 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @errnoent I think your standards are fucking absurd then
[2017-04-05 22:16:08 UTC] lyingearth21: cheer20 Persona 3
[2017-04-05 22:16:10 UTC] metarrixxxx: @hapticbabyman yeah... a system restore is no fun.... especially for an emulator.. gee aha

Must have be something w/ the virtual drive and switching discs, b/c it played the first disc perfectly with zero problems. I'd suggest just sticking w/ single-disc games until you make sure you can switch discs with no issues.

[2017-04-05 22:24:47 UTC] hapticbabyman: @metarrixxxx I'm hoping either they start producing the Rhea again or do an Everdrive kind of thing for Saturn. That way we can just play the games on the actual hardware off flash cards. That'd beat using an emulator but it'd mean needing the console (thankfully I have a Saturn laying around still ;)

[2017-04-05 23:00:45 UTC] blue_blur64: Phil, a good tip is to press R1, which would automatically change your persona to the skill that an enemy is weak to
