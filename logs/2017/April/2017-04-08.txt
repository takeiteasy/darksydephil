[2017-04-08 20:03:20 UTC] conky89: GTA 5 was at the very least better than 4 imo.
[2017-04-08 20:03:23 UTC] yacherdy: oh dragin I thought I remember you saying you don't really like them my bad
[2017-04-08 20:03:27 UTC] eternia_forever: give it time you motherfucker
[2017-04-08 20:03:27 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Recoil is stronger
[2017-04-08 20:03:27 UTC] betheboom: i stuck with the same loadout until i got it upgraded to level 5 and advanced and all that
[2017-04-08 20:03:33 UTC] stuart360: GTAV looks amazing on PC, not this 30fps shite on Pro
[2017-04-08 20:03:35 UTC] podusmonens: what do you mean pcgamehunter?
[2017-04-08 20:03:53 UTC] yacherdy: I'm one of the few who like GTA IV more than V
[2017-04-08 20:03:53 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's like 60 FPS on bad hardware. Rockstar must have impissoned all the good programmers
[2017-04-08 20:03:55 UTC] codenameone: @DJRuno1 Less weight = higher recoil = reduced accuracy.
[2017-04-08 20:04:00 UTC] djruno1: but it is a single fire weapon anyway so why bother with recoil
[2017-04-08 20:04:01 UTC] barzonius: We're here representing the Mustard Race
[2017-04-08 20:04:15 UTC] eternia_forever: the falcon
[2017-04-08 20:04:18 UTC] podusmonens: yeah but it's CPU intensive
[2017-04-08 20:04:19 UTC] thepwner30: dspGlitch
[2017-04-08 20:04:22 UTC] barzonius: Step up your e-inches and build a PC
[2017-04-08 20:04:26 UTC] royal_phalanx91: GTA IV driving is much better than V @YaCherdy
[2017-04-08 20:04:28 UTC] eternia_forever: light speed
[2017-04-08 20:04:32 UTC] conky89: GTA 4 felt like a tech demo and an experiment for the series
[2017-04-08 20:04:32 UTC] djruno1: wait wtf
[2017-04-08 20:04:40 UTC] anondublo1: ???
[2017-04-08 20:04:41 UTC] yacherdy: @Royal_Phalanx91 yeah true I was disappointed by GTA V'S driving mechanics
[2017-04-08 20:04:44 UTC] stuart360: pcgamehunter GTAV is actually quite demanding on PC, especially in the city
[2017-04-08 20:04:48 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Didn't Phil send MP Characters on missions last time? :/
[2017-04-08 20:04:57 UTC] sardarkh: Oh shit, he can now enjoy the patched faces in Andromeda

[2017-04-08 20:05:02 UTC] pcgamehunter: Not from what I saw, compared to all other games, I had no trouble keeping constant 60
[2017-04-08 20:05:07 UTC] captcaveman4201: east bound n down is mad funny
[2017-04-08 20:05:15 UTC] podusmonens: my fps drop to 60 in intersections stuart. it's capped at 75 with freesync
[2017-04-08 20:05:18 UTC] conky89: GTA V was far better with driving. I do not miss the tank-like controls in IV
[2017-04-08 20:05:20 UTC] shekelbergosteinwitz: PunOko
[2017-04-08 20:05:23 UTC] anondublo1: torrents finished? Kappa

[2017-04-08 20:05:30 UTC] royal_phalanx91: "I need to take a shit"-Phil
[2017-04-08 20:05:39 UTC] pcgamehunter: lol torrenting while streaming anon ?
[2017-04-08 20:05:49 UTC] pcgamehunter: Not a good idea, espcially with comcast

[2017-04-08 20:05:51 UTC] anondublo1: gotta utilize that business connection Kappa
[2017-04-08 20:05:56 UTC] stuart360: Well its 60fps for me, i use vsync wth all gamres, cant do with tearing
[2017-04-08 20:05:57 UTC] royal_phalanx91: My bank blocked my subscription to Phil lol
[2017-04-08 20:05:59 UTC] shekelbergosteinwitz: Daddy Phil you can use my mouth as a toilet TehePelo
[2017-04-08 20:06:00 UTC] betheboom: cherdy :D

[2017-04-08 20:06:31 UTC] djruno1: fucking didnt let me sub
[2017-04-08 20:06:33 UTC] vendatus: GTAIV driving was sluggish they even used it in Sleeping Dogs and WatchDogs Kappa
[2017-04-08 20:06:34 UTC] stuart360: I know bud, i just use my 50inch tv though
[2017-04-08 20:06:44 UTC] djruno1: screw you twitch
[2017-04-08 20:06:46 UTC] conky89: I love in that one set of SFV when phil mentioned he had business class internet in the video descriptions
[2017-04-08 20:06:46 UTC] stinkinburrows: You're already subbed dawg
[2017-04-08 20:06:50 UTC] royal_phalanx91: GTA V driving is casul
[2017-04-08 20:06:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: did you spend too much money betting on the grand national Royal_Phalanx91?
[2017-04-08 20:06:52 UTC] anondublo1: I liked the driving in 4 TBH
[2017-04-08 20:07:06 UTC] royal_phalanx91: lol no I don't watch horse racing jimbob
[2017-04-08 20:07:08 UTC] somone192: I have freesync monitor but is it v sync but not using graphics card resources?
[2017-04-08 20:07:09 UTC] podusmonens: motorcycles are ridiculously easy to drive in gta y
[2017-04-08 20:07:13 UTC] podusmonens: v&
[2017-04-08 20:07:20 UTC] djruno1: i wasnt subbed 5 mins ago
[2017-04-08 20:07:20 UTC] anondublo1: watch dogs was pretty bad though, sleeping dogs was god awful
[2017-04-08 20:07:22 UTC] barzonius: Everyone here is a casual pleb, Vice City obviously had the best driving
[2017-04-08 20:07:38 UTC] djruno1: i demand my shoutout dspAngrydsp
[2017-04-08 20:07:39 UTC] podusmonens: bikes were brutal in vice city
[2017-04-08 20:07:49 UTC] beholderchil: vice city had the best everything
[2017-04-08 20:07:50 UTC] pcgamehunter: Please, we all know Ryder has the best ridin Kappa
[2017-04-08 20:07:51 UTC] vendatus: Vice City best soundtrack Kreygasm
[2017-04-08 20:07:54 UTC] podusmonens: one mistake and you're out
[2017-04-08 20:07:56 UTC] anondublo1: vice city stories had the best aiming mechanics Kappa
[2017-04-08 20:08:03 UTC] barzonius: @Vendatus Amen!
[2017-04-08 20:08:03 UTC] yacherdy: Vice City was a great game until my save corrupted SeemsGood
[2017-04-08 20:08:06 UTC] stuart360: WatchDogs 2 is a great game though, its fun as hell just go around the map blowing up steam pipes and electrocuting people lol. It also looks a level above GTAV
[2017-04-08 20:08:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh no yacherdy NotLikeThis
[2017-04-08 20:08:20 UTC] podusmonens: saves corrupt if you use cheats cherdy :P
[2017-04-08 20:08:22 UTC] yacherdy: But I think I prefer GTA III to Vice City...
[2017-04-08 20:08:30 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Cora's Father NotLikeThis
[2017-04-08 20:08:32 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Watch Dogs 2 is so boring to me
[2017-04-08 20:08:37 UTC] yacherdy: nah it was the ice cream truck corruption
[2017-04-08 20:08:45 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like why can't they just make a Person of Interest game
[2017-04-08 20:08:55 UTC] nolbert87: is it break time? just got here.
[2017-04-08 20:08:57 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and let you walk around like John Reese CQC'ing people
[2017-04-08 20:08:58 UTC] beholderchil: they made one
[2017-04-08 20:08:59 UTC] anondublo1: 3 was the 3D one I played, my favorite of the two too
[2017-04-08 20:08:59 UTC] yacherdy: Although Ray Liotta was in VC so give it credit
[2017-04-08 20:09:02 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: He's already on break jesus lol
[2017-04-08 20:09:03 UTC] beholderchil: its called Persona 5
[2017-04-08 20:09:06 UTC] stuart360: Phoenix just have fun on the map, thats when it gets fun
[2017-04-08 20:09:11 UTC] pcgamehunter: lol saves corrupt randomly tbh
[2017-04-08 20:09:12 UTC] podusmonens: san andreas was my favorite until V. it still has some of that atmosphere. IV was weird
[2017-04-08 20:09:14 UTC] playcool18: fuck
[2017-04-08 20:09:18 UTC] pcgamehunter: Also the save function keeps bugging out
[2017-04-08 20:09:22 UTC] playcool18: I came and dsp is taking a shit...
[2017-04-08 20:09:29 UTC] yacherdy: For me: IV > V > SA > III > VC
[2017-04-08 20:09:30 UTC] playcool18: guess I need to wait
[2017-04-08 20:09:41 UTC] anondublo1: I loved the character interactions in 4
[2017-04-08 20:09:44 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Person of Interest had like the best idea for a story for a game imo
[2017-04-08 20:09:53 UTC] podusmonens: VC is definitely higher for the than IV :D
[2017-04-08 20:09:54 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and with real world events that show was horrifying
[2017-04-08 20:09:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Vice City last YaCherdy NotLikeThis
[2017-04-08 20:09:57 UTC] anondublo1: san andreas is my favorite of the 3d games though
[2017-04-08 20:10:00 UTC] vendatus: San Andreas was too urban for me Kappa
[2017-04-08 20:10:02 UTC] stuart360: Vice City is the best GTA for me. Cool 80's setting, and the best soundtrack of a game ever
[2017-04-08 20:10:02 UTC] yacherdy: yep VC last :)
[2017-04-08 20:10:14 UTC] podusmonens: you get into country side too vendatus
[2017-04-08 20:10:22 UTC] pcgamehunter: I like Nico too much :d
[2017-04-08 20:10:23 UTC] yacherdy: Miami is cool and all but I prefer grungy city of NYC
[2017-04-08 20:10:24 UTC] nolbert87: hows the game been today? has the new patch made things any better?
[2017-04-08 20:10:24 UTC] podusmonens: for a bit
[2017-04-08 20:10:27 UTC] jmon_1985: 3 was my fave
[2017-04-08 20:10:35 UTC] codenameone: @nolbert87 No.
[2017-04-08 20:10:36 UTC] phoenixrising2015: For those who don't know Person of Interest but know Watch Dogs, take the missions where you have to chase down people you know about to commit a crime and watch them
[2017-04-08 20:10:36 UTC] pcgamehunter: Coussiiiin let's go bowling!!
[2017-04-08 20:10:40 UTC] pcgamehunter: Always gets me
[2017-04-08 20:10:41 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Thats Person of Interest
[2017-04-08 20:10:44 UTC] anondublo1: Kappa @nolbert87
[2017-04-08 20:10:52 UTC] nolbert87: shame
[2017-04-08 20:10:58 UTC] anondublo1: let's go see some big american titties
[2017-04-08 20:11:00 UTC] pcgamehunter: "Roman I'm driving a fucking truck full of explosive!"
[2017-04-08 20:11:02 UTC] djruno1: can someone answer me this? if amazon prime costs 50$/year and you can sub to someone for free every month, that would make 60$/year you invest into a streamer. how does amazon make money???
[2017-04-08 20:11:05 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I guess I'll watch Shokugeki no Soma till Phil comes back
[2017-04-08 20:11:07 UTC] yacherdy: Barbara with big American titties
[2017-04-08 20:11:17 UTC] royal_phalanx91: BEEEG TEEETIESS
[2017-04-08 20:11:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the streamer only gets half of the sub DJRuno1
[2017-04-08 20:11:36 UTC] yacherdy: Roman = Phi, Mallorie = Leanna
[2017-04-08 20:11:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: so 30 bucks a year
[2017-04-08 20:11:37 UTC] phoenixrising2015: I like how in GTA V they reference Niko
[2017-04-08 20:11:39 UTC] pcgamehunter: Those are my favorite Kappa
[2017-04-08 20:11:41 UTC] stuart360: NY gets a bit boring though Yacherdy because its in so many games. I also hate how its basically a city in the middle of the ocean when you use a chopper etc, it looks so weird. Couldn't they of done some low poly rendering to make it look like it was connected to the mainland lol
[2017-04-08 20:11:43 UTC] vendatus: Yacherdy spent a lot of time in the red light district MingLee
[2017-04-08 20:11:54 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Mallorie looks like Leanna come to think of it Kappa
[2017-04-08 20:11:56 UTC] yacherdy: MingLee
[2017-04-08 20:11:56 UTC] podusmonens: I felt like at the beginning of V it got way too preachy with the social commentary, the tech world, acting world, hollywood etc
[2017-04-08 20:12:05 UTC] anondublo1: @YaCherdy getting cucked by Vlad? Vlad = Machinima? Kappa
[2017-04-08 20:12:10 UTC] yacherdy: uh oh
[2017-04-08 20:12:11 UTC] phoenixrising2015: They don't even call him by name. They just call him "that guy in Liberty City"
[2017-04-08 20:12:16 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Vlad=detractors Kappa
[2017-04-08 20:12:16 UTC] podusmonens: rockstar used to be more subtle
[2017-04-08 20:12:20 UTC] theycallmejimbob: not as bad as Watch dogs 2 dragin
[2017-04-08 20:12:25 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Like Niko caused so much havoc they don't even have to say Niko's name
[2017-04-08 20:12:27 UTC] yacherdy: @stuart360 Yeah I get that...I just liked Rockstar's version of NYC. It was pretty realistic.
[2017-04-08 20:12:42 UTC] pcgamehunter: Well GTA V is the first one to really have internet full on, so they had to adapt it
[2017-04-08 20:12:45 UTC] vendatus: But Kifflom! dragin CoolStoryBob
[2017-04-08 20:13:09 UTC] royal_phalanx91: The car damage got nerfed in GTA V, I'm salty
[2017-04-08 20:13:13 UTC] yacherdy: ^
[2017-04-08 20:13:22 UTC] stuart360: That Cortez picture, eww
[2017-04-08 20:13:31 UTC] djruno1: i got banned from gta online for a month :(
[2017-04-08 20:13:38 UTC] podusmonens: the iFruit :D
[2017-04-08 20:13:46 UTC] yacherdy: I hear Rockstar bans people they don't even mean to ban
[2017-04-08 20:13:56 UTC] pcgamehunter: lol wat
[2017-04-08 20:13:57 UTC] phoenixrising2015: That was an accident
[2017-04-08 20:14:00 UTC] anondublo1: rouge mods Kappa
[2017-04-08 20:14:01 UTC] theycallmejimbob: if you're on a map with someone using cheats rockstar bans you too
[2017-04-08 20:14:02 UTC] yacherdy: I haven't played online in 3 years. Probably a good thing
[2017-04-08 20:14:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hacks even
[2017-04-08 20:14:14 UTC] phoenixrising2015: And I think they actually gave players items or something to repay them with
[2017-04-08 20:14:20 UTC] conky89: I did not like how the tone constantly flipped-flopped in GTA IV. One minute the story is being a serious crime drama and then you go to an internet cafe called TW@
[2017-04-08 20:14:22 UTC] codenameone: @YaCherdy It's true. GTA Online is a giant shitshow.
[2017-04-08 20:14:25 UTC] anondublo1: online is so fucking boring to me
[2017-04-08 20:14:28 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Or maybe that was Xbox Live
[2017-04-08 20:14:37 UTC] djruno1: they banned me because someone dropped money bags and spawned the people on top of it. dspNothing
[2017-04-08 20:14:45 UTC] yacherdy: MingLee
[2017-04-08 20:14:46 UTC] phoenixrising2015: There used to be a money thing people did
[2017-04-08 20:14:51 UTC] phoenixrising2015: where they made miniguns fire money
[2017-04-08 20:14:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: did you get to keep the money
[2017-04-08 20:14:56 UTC] stuart360: Haven;'t even touched online and i have had GTAV since it released lol
[2017-04-08 20:15:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and you get banned for getting too much money at one time
[2017-04-08 20:15:13 UTC] pcgamehunter: lol what is this real life bank accounts
[2017-04-08 20:15:15 UTC] phoenixrising2015: so people would literally be running from money flying at them from a minigun
[2017-04-08 20:15:18 UTC] conky89: I never played online but I heard lots of negative things about it
[2017-04-08 20:15:38 UTC] podusmonens: what can you do in online, anyway? just fuck around?
[2017-04-08 20:15:42 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Yeah
[2017-04-08 20:15:44 UTC] pcgamehunter: thats hilarious phoenix XD
[2017-04-08 20:15:44 UTC] podusmonens: races?
[2017-04-08 20:15:45 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and do missions
[2017-04-08 20:15:45 UTC] djruno1: do heists
[2017-04-08 20:15:48 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Or races
[2017-04-08 20:15:51 UTC] yacherdy: you can do jobs but those got boring
[2017-04-08 20:15:51 UTC] anondublo1: online is basically just grinding
[2017-04-08 20:15:53 UTC] djruno1: the heists are cool
[2017-04-08 20:15:54 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Had a hard time getting into GTA V online games
[2017-04-08 20:15:57 UTC] podusmonens: heists sound fun
[2017-04-08 20:16:05 UTC] stuart360: Anyone else think its cringeworthy the amount of people who hack and cheat in online games?, i mean does your stupid kill/death ratio mean that much to you?, simpletons
[2017-04-08 20:16:05 UTC] royal_phalanx91: connection always messed up for no reason
[2017-04-08 20:16:10 UTC] conky89: You cannot cause mayhem in a GTA game without being in shit
[2017-04-08 20:16:11 UTC] anondublo1: heists are fucking shit if you have to play with randoms
[2017-04-08 20:16:12 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Basically you grind out missions and such in online from the guy Franklin worked for and others
[2017-04-08 20:16:21 UTC] conky89: that is dumb
[2017-04-08 20:16:22 UTC] podusmonens: I mean hell payday 2 basically took the heist aspect and made an entire game out of that
[2017-04-08 20:16:24 UTC] phoenixrising2015: you can't buy certain weapons until certain ranks though
[2017-04-08 20:16:27 UTC] podusmonens: and payday 1 ofc

[2017-04-08 20:18:48 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Seriously, it would be like if Borderlands told you you had to be level 50 to use a sniper rifle
[2017-04-08 20:18:51 UTC] podusmonens: or his colon
[2017-04-08 20:18:52 UTC] anondublo1: or start eating more fiber, jesus

[2017-04-08 20:21:48 UTC] podusmonens: yea*
[2017-04-08 20:21:49 UTC] yacherdy: I wanted to have sex with Catwoman

[2017-04-08 20:22:34 UTC] phoenixrising2015: @Vendatus, I just didn't like the lore for that particular version. I was intrigued by their version of The Penguin
[2017-04-08 20:22:36 UTC] thepastryarchy: @DarksydePhil Ever thought about using a shotgun? I hated assault rifles. The piranha shotgun paired with the biotic charge ability's shield restoration is crazy good.
[2017-04-08 20:22:40 UTC] codenameone: Telltale is shit now.
[2017-04-08 20:22:46 UTC] yacherdy: bethe you have to realize dragin hates story games

[2017-04-08 20:22:55 UTC] podusmonens: why name yourself tell tale if the tales that you tell are super lame and shitty
[2017-04-08 20:22:55 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The idea the waynes were mobsters and Vicki Vale was what she was was so stupid to me
[2017-04-08 20:22:58 UTC] anondublo1: okay
[2017-04-08 20:23:01 UTC] betheboom: cherdy so he hates all games

[2017-04-08 20:23:15 UTC] anondublo1: think we know how that happened Kappa
[2017-04-08 20:23:18 UTC] codenameone: Same rehashed formula over and over. Just take something and make it a movie, where the choices are made up and don't mean anything.
[2017-04-08 20:23:23 UTC] eternia_forever: let us continue

[2017-04-08 20:23:41 UTC] betheboom: you said he hates story
[2017-04-08 20:23:45 UTC] podusmonens: if bethe wants a good story game he should play SYberia or some shit

[2017-04-08 22:43:25 UTC] anondublo1: this is roleplaying game, how the fuck is the writing so bad, and the characters so cringeworthy
[2017-04-08 22:43:29 UTC] karlis_k: it's not bad - for those who crave more of M.E. it hits the spot ... for those wanting more of the original M.E. trilogy it's a letdown
[2017-04-08 22:43:35 UTC] betheboom: i never played MP
[2017-04-08 22:44:03 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Yeah one of the huge enemies you thought today was doing nothing weird.

[2017-04-08 22:46:20 UTC] djruno1: why do omni tools look so weird
[2017-04-08 22:46:22 UTC] karlis_k: @Bobbi_Ling I'm sure just about anyone could recall multiple different well memorable events/features from the original trilogy ... this seems like one of the countless unimportant Star Wars subplots/sidestories

[2017-04-08 22:48:58 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @eternia_forever The one whose denying an event that is being reported on every news channel is you. If you're going to deny reality then you need to just stay in your basement.
