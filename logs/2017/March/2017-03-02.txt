[2017-03-02 00:12:06 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Charizard545 yeah I'm worried about Zelda. Over-saturation of open-world games in a small period of time, and maybe too similar to Horizon on the surface
[2017-03-02 00:12:11 UTC] megamannt125: @Charizard545 Zelda has an incredibly physics engine, it'll be fun to see how it fucks up Phil
[2017-03-02 00:12:13 UTC] capstonegaming: Give shout out to TOP NEP SHE IS THE BEST WAIFU cheer10
[2017-03-02 00:12:15 UTC] ands_: Why does a game need "new" mechanics if it's done in a fun way.
[2017-03-02 00:12:16 UTC] amplitory2: inb4 phil gets called a misogynist for not calling this game great
[2017-03-02 00:12:21 UTC] rebecca388: what gino

[2017-03-02 00:13:26 UTC] gazza2305: its not the game the viewers aren't interested in, its you
[2017-03-02 00:13:29 UTC] taniaraven: lol. engaged.
[2017-03-02 00:13:29 UTC] hapticbabyman: people probably already got their fill from other streams earlier and/or are playing the game themselves and don't want anything spoiled yet
[2017-03-02 00:13:30 UTC] amplitory2: IM YOUR BIGGEST FAN!!!!!!! :d
[2017-03-02 00:13:31 UTC] rebecca388: i guess deep

[2017-03-02 00:13:37 UTC] kinggoken: good stream DSP!!
[2017-03-02 00:13:38 UTC] megamannt125: The game is completely boring

[2017-03-02 00:13:44 UTC] chocobotamer: People are keeping chat active, that's engagement

[2017-03-02 00:13:53 UTC] skysands2017: Take care everyone
[2017-03-02 00:13:59 UTC] darksydephil: Gazza2305 instead of spamming that, why not explain? what the fuck exactly SHOULD i be doing during a gameplay stream that i'm not doing?
[2017-03-02 00:14:02 UTC] indahood21: Far Cry Zero Dawn
[2017-03-02 00:14:08 UTC] darksydephil: because right now you just sound like a dumbfuck parrot

[2017-03-02 00:14:34 UTC] ginosaji48: bye everyone, becky, phil

[2017-03-02 00:14:43 UTC] amplitory2: its honestly the game bro dont listen to that shit
[2017-03-02 00:14:44 UTC] darksydephil: yes, is that it? should i be whipping my tits out during the stream? or telling unrelated stories?
[2017-03-02 00:14:55 UTC] megamannt125: Next Horizon stream needs a Phil cleavage cam
[2017-03-02 00:14:59 UTC] darksydephil: if i'm going to do that, why play the game? lol
[2017-03-02 00:15:08 UTC] crazed_connovore: right
[2017-03-02 00:15:12 UTC] kinggoken: Yo, Gazza man up lol
[2017-03-02 00:15:14 UTC] gazza2305: Interact with your audience maybe you autistic fuck?
[2017-03-02 00:15:15 UTC] broganahd: >When phil doesn't realize its him that isn't interesting, not the game. cmonBruh cmonBruh cmonBruh
[2017-03-02 00:15:15 UTC] mentally_ill_child: What game is tonight?

[2017-03-02 00:15:19 UTC] capstonegaming: Phil dont play this game again
[2017-03-02 00:15:31 UTC] darksydephil: "interact with your audience" lol the other generic answer from brainless kids
[2017-03-02 00:15:32 UTC] tenpiece32: if its shit game than why not
[2017-03-02 00:15:32 UTC] codenameone: It's true; lots of more popular streamers talk about things wholly unrelated to the game they're playing.
[2017-03-02 00:15:33 UTC] rebecca388: ohhh
[2017-03-02 00:15:33 UTC] gazza2305: ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
[2017-03-02 00:15:43 UTC] amplitory2: DSP as long as I hear you playing a game and having a good time idgaf. This game is pretty stale tbh
[2017-03-02 00:15:46 UTC] darksydephil: okay, so then ill just talk with my audience the entire time and not even play the game. how about that?
[2017-03-02 00:15:48 UTC] gazza2305: Brb off to beg for money
[2017-03-02 00:15:51 UTC] capstonegaming: this game isnt entertianing enough for streams im glad it wont last long
[2017-03-02 00:15:55 UTC] megamannt125: I hate stream interaction tbh fuck that
[2017-03-02 00:15:56 UTC] darksydephil: because that's all there is too it!
[2017-03-02 00:15:56 UTC] skysands2017: @BroganaHD Greentexting outside of 4chins?
[2017-03-02 00:16:01 UTC] kinggoken: lol Gazza is just trolling now
[2017-03-02 00:16:07 UTC] capstonegaming: itll be gone soon and well be watchign zelda
[2017-03-02 00:16:10 UTC] broganahd: @skysands2017 of course, brethren
[2017-03-02 00:16:12 UTC] darksydephil: see, you proved your moronic intelligence level, so you can fuck off now lol
[2017-03-02 00:16:14 UTC] tenpiece32: @DarksydePhil what do you have to lose if you try one stream
[2017-03-02 00:16:16 UTC] mentally_ill_child: @DarksydePhil What game is tonight?
[2017-03-02 00:16:26 UTC] amplitory2: @DarksydePhil I enjoyed your stream today take that as it is :)
[2017-03-02 00:16:33 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Phil, is it an option for you to sell your current house and go back to live in Connecticut, if it gets too bad?
[2017-03-02 00:16:38 UTC] broganahd: @DarksydePhil Its "how bou dat" Phil. C'mon man, be hip with us youngsters
[2017-03-02 00:16:39 UTC] capstonegaming: stop guys
[2017-03-02 00:16:43 UTC] johnnyzee_s: because your house has appreciated in value right
[2017-03-02 00:16:43 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: what's a wax tart?
[2017-03-02 00:16:45 UTC] megamannt125: Already explained Jonny
[2017-03-02 00:16:49 UTC] megamannt125: He's paying the same
[2017-03-02 00:16:50 UTC] capstonegaming: just play a different game dood this one is the shits nothing to do with u
[2017-03-02 00:16:51 UTC] crazed_connovore: @darksydephil don't let the trolls antagonize you
[2017-03-02 00:16:57 UTC] megamannt125: Because of taxes
[2017-03-02 00:17:00 UTC] darksydephil: that would probably be the single dumbest thing i could possibly do Johnnyzee_s
[2017-03-02 00:17:14 UTC] playcool18: yeah
[2017-03-02 00:17:18 UTC] tenpiece32: @DarksydePhil notice how people interact with you more when you do talk here
[2017-03-02 00:17:20 UTC] amplitory2: East coast is sucking right now, Im in NJ shit isnt cheap
[2017-03-02 00:17:22 UTC] indahood21: Me and my Baby momma was enjoying yo stream dawg
[2017-03-02 00:17:22 UTC] darksydephil: sell off the house that's appreciating in value and move to a place hwer all real estate values are tanking, taxes are high, and my business will be worse off lol
[2017-03-02 00:17:32 UTC] skysands2017: I don't understand some people. If you don't like the stream, you can go watch other streamers. What I like about Phil's streams is how natural they are. No faking, no screaming and stuff like that.
[2017-03-02 00:17:40 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Well you can't afford to hold on to both houses, so you have to take a step back sometimes
[2017-03-02 00:17:41 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: Taxes are high because you live in a democrat owned area
[2017-03-02 00:17:42 UTC] megamannt125: Phil's detractors are Masochists
[2017-03-02 00:17:45 UTC] johnnyzee_s: you can't keep going forward and expect to keep winning
[2017-03-02 00:18:09 UTC] darksydephil: well that's the problem skysands2017 , the common viewer isn't an intelligent human. it's a dumbfuck kid who wants clowns on stream, not actual gameplay
[2017-03-02 00:18:18 UTC] mentally_ill_child: @skysands2017 No screaming? Are we watching the same person?
[2017-03-02 00:18:19 UTC] broganahd: @skysands2017 There are a very small amount of streamers that do that. They're there, dont get me wrong, but its a very small number
[2017-03-02 00:18:24 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Phil honestly if you had NO interaction with your stream
[2017-03-02 00:18:25 UTC] megamannt125: Anyways fuck this game see you on Switch launch Phil
[2017-03-02 00:18:26 UTC] johnnyzee_s: it would be better
[2017-03-02 00:18:29 UTC] tenpiece32: @DarksydePhil just talk to the chat more didn't someone on twitter say how much it made it feel better after they lost someone
[2017-03-02 00:18:29 UTC] johnnyzee_s: like not even looking at the chat
[2017-03-02 00:18:31 UTC] johnnyzee_s: just have moderators
[2017-03-02 00:18:32 UTC] johnnyzee_s: and that's it
[2017-03-02 00:18:36 UTC] johnnyzee_s: your content is DIFFERENT
[2017-03-02 00:18:38 UTC] johnnyzee_s: when you ahve the chat on
[2017-03-02 00:18:46 UTC] destinyzx1: so stubborn yet so blind
[2017-03-02 00:18:51 UTC] darksydephil: Johnnyzee_s thta doesn't even make sense. how can i make sure the stream is running and working with the chat closed?
[2017-03-02 00:18:54 UTC] playcool18: that is your opinion alone jonnhy
[2017-03-02 00:18:56 UTC] llpoole: That's it insult 'most viewers'
[2017-03-02 00:18:58 UTC] lightweightbro: hi
[2017-03-02 00:18:59 UTC] capstonegaming: Call your fans more names cheer100
[2017-03-02 00:18:59 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: the chat is what drives the community
[2017-03-02 00:19:00 UTC] johnnyzee_s: You can have the dashboard up
[2017-03-02 00:19:02 UTC] johnnyzee_s: and take the chat away
[2017-03-02 00:19:05 UTC] johnnyzee_s: you don't have the look at the chat
[2017-03-02 00:19:06 UTC] codenameone: I checked out a guy streaming BF1, but instead of facecame he had a CGI dog with headphones on it. Every sub and follow he would yell and scream. It got annoying with the quickness.
[2017-03-02 00:19:10 UTC] tehbreezy1: How can you expect to get good views when you whine about the behavior of the "common viewer?"
[2017-03-02 00:19:12 UTC] indahood21: @ darksydephil dont listen to these kids fam the stream is fucking good loving da game real talk
[2017-03-02 00:19:22 UTC] megamannt125: KWO put me in the screencap
[2017-03-02 00:19:22 UTC] khaleeesiii: Wait so the average viewer, aka me, is apparently an idiot?
[2017-03-02 00:19:22 UTC] darksydephil: the dashboard doesn't show anything lol. i'd have no idea if theres an audio issue or even if the steram is having problems.
[2017-03-02 00:19:31 UTC] tenpiece32: @DarksydePhil damn man wtf is wrong with you
[2017-03-02 00:19:34 UTC] amplitory2: I'm really glad Phil has been back on Twitch. Theres always gonna be people giving him shit though, the stream was fine
[2017-03-02 00:19:34 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: I love having the chat so we can discuss Democrats and Dank memes
[2017-03-02 00:19:37 UTC] johnnyzee_s: how did you do it before???
[2017-03-02 00:19:41 UTC] codenameone: That stream had thousands of viewers. Phil's kinda right about what the common viewer is interested in.
[2017-03-02 00:19:46 UTC] johnnyzee_s: you didn't have anyone telling you if it's working
[2017-03-02 00:19:54 UTC] darksydephil: when?
[2017-03-02 00:20:01 UTC] darksydephil: ive always had stream chat open for that very purpose
[2017-03-02 00:20:01 UTC] johnnyzee_s: before you streamed
[2017-03-02 00:20:10 UTC] darksydephil: before i streamed i was recording offline with a camera! lol
[2017-03-02 00:20:10 UTC] johnnyzee_s: you had the sound optimized
[2017-03-02 00:20:15 UTC] darksydephil: of ocurse it was working then
[2017-03-02 00:20:20 UTC] darksydephil: the camera was in front of my face
[2017-03-02 00:20:24 UTC] darksydephil: so i knew it was on lol
[2017-03-02 00:20:26 UTC] johnnyzee_s: you never did direct capture
[2017-03-02 00:20:28 UTC] johnnyzee_s: without streaming?
[2017-03-02 00:20:36 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: What's a wax tart?
[2017-03-02 00:20:43 UTC] darksydephil: no, direct capture and streaming went hand in hand, i did them together
[2017-03-02 00:20:47 UTC] skysands2017: btw, Phil. I fixed the T-Shirt design. You should totally check it out.
[2017-03-02 00:20:51 UTC] codenameone: @PimpleFacedPantySniffer It's a tart made of wax.
[2017-03-02 00:20:52 UTC] johnnyzee_s: well then can't you use the prestream
[2017-03-02 00:20:56 UTC] johnnyzee_s: to optimize the settings of the game sound
[2017-03-02 00:20:57 UTC] lightweightbro: lol
[2017-03-02 00:20:57 UTC] darksydephil: and the rare times that i do offline capture w/o streaming, sometimes theres tech stuff i don't catch and theres no way to do so
[2017-03-02 00:21:04 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: oh I understand now @CodenameOne
[2017-03-02 00:21:11 UTC] darksydephil: what are you talking about? optimize settings?
[2017-03-02 00:21:12 UTC] johnnyzee_s: stream chat makes you walk into walls and stuff
[2017-03-02 00:21:14 UTC] johnnyzee_s: all the time
[2017-03-02 00:21:16 UTC] destinyzx1: nothing is perfect whether it be recording or streaming. you got to expect the unexpected.
[2017-03-02 00:21:19 UTC] johnnyzee_s: optimize settings of your sound
[2017-03-02 00:21:22 UTC] johnnyzee_s: before you start the stream
[2017-03-02 00:21:22 UTC] darksydephil: we're talking about stuff going wrong. like sound going out, out of nowhere
[2017-03-02 00:21:24 UTC] codenameone: @PimpleFacedPantySniffer Lmao
[2017-03-02 00:21:29 UTC] darksydephil: or the stream chopping up etc
[2017-03-02 00:21:35 UTC] darksydephil: or going down completely
[2017-03-02 00:21:39 UTC] johnnyzee_s: can't you get PMs from mods
[2017-03-02 00:21:39 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: Can you eat a wax tart?
[2017-03-02 00:21:40 UTC] johnnyzee_s: to tell you
[2017-03-02 00:21:45 UTC] johnnyzee_s: without having the chat open
[2017-03-02 00:21:48 UTC] capstonegaming: it was fine
[2017-03-02 00:21:55 UTC] darksydephil: mods aren't watching the stream 24/7. they're not paid to do so
[2017-03-02 00:21:56 UTC] leannawas16: Hi Phil :)
[2017-03-02 00:21:57 UTC] codenameone: @PimpleFacedPantySniffer I would not recommend it. But, I'm not a doctor.
[2017-03-02 00:22:09 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: ehh what are you gonna do @CodenameOne
[2017-03-02 00:22:10 UTC] leannawas16: Are you still doing that vlog tonight?
[2017-03-02 00:22:13 UTC] darksydephil: whats the problem with the chat???? you're the only person here who has issue with it ilol
[2017-03-02 00:22:21 UTC] codenameone: Benned.
[2017-03-02 00:22:29 UTC] johnnyzee_s: the chat makes you do things uncharacteristic
[2017-03-02 00:22:30 UTC] drilbit777: Are you still gonna play horizon or drop it?
[2017-03-02 00:22:32 UTC] johnnyzee_s: like take breaks to deal with people
[2017-03-02 00:22:35 UTC] johnnyzee_s: or walk into walls
[2017-03-02 00:22:37 UTC] johnnyzee_s: or not read
[2017-03-02 00:22:38 UTC] mattyessendon: Hey Phil.

[2017-03-02 00:22:50 UTC] darksydephil: did you ever watch my stuff pre-2013?
[2017-03-02 00:22:53 UTC] darksydephil: i did all of those things lol
[2017-03-02 00:22:54 UTC] amplitory2: I feel like Phil should play whatever makes him happy. Don't wanna see someone suffer thru something
[2017-03-02 00:22:54 UTC] johnnyzee_s: yes i did
[2017-03-02 00:22:54 UTC] mattyessendon: What's the matter Phillip?
[2017-03-02 00:22:57 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: when is the vlog?
[2017-03-02 00:22:58 UTC] broganahd: Is this 2013 bruh?
[2017-03-02 00:22:59 UTC] johnnyzee_s: but you never walked into corners
[2017-03-02 00:23:01 UTC] johnnyzee_s: then be like "oh shit"
[2017-03-02 00:23:03 UTC] johnnyzee_s: and play it off
[2017-03-02 00:23:10 UTC] johnnyzee_s: that shit cheapens the quality all the time
[2017-03-02 00:23:17 UTC] johnnyzee_s: like you dont' actually care
[2017-03-02 00:23:24 UTC] mentally_ill_child: When is the stream starting?
[2017-03-02 00:23:30 UTC] darksydephil: this game isn't bad and i'm not unhappy. im just not understanding the insane hype and praise for a game that's cut/pasted from other games. it doesn't make it a better/great game at all, especially when really the only thing interesting so far is the story
[2017-03-02 00:23:37 UTC] darksydephil: the combat is repetitive and boring just liek the games it stole from lol
[2017-03-02 00:23:39 UTC] playcool18: only problem I could have with the chat is that it something loses focus on the games and go astray talkinga bout irrelevant topics towards the game, but that sometimes works as a nice breather
[2017-03-02 00:23:52 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: because video game reviewers are taking bribes likes whores!
[2017-03-02 00:23:57 UTC] phoenixrush85: Kappa
[2017-03-02 00:24:00 UTC] johnnyzee_s: yeah and trolls come here too and they upset you and that changes your perception of the game
[2017-03-02 00:24:00 UTC] indahood21: Johnnyzee fuck is u talking bout boi
[2017-03-02 00:24:02 UTC] kinggoken: i highly doubt that
[2017-03-02 00:24:03 UTC] johnnyzee_s: or your attitude towards it
[2017-03-02 00:24:03 UTC] lightweightbro: @Johnnyzee_s I don't think Phil walking into a wall causes a -400 drop in viewers. That's not a valid point you're making.
[2017-03-02 00:24:04 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: still are! down with video game journalist!
[2017-03-02 00:24:05 UTC] broganahd: @DarksydePhil Then you may as well not play any game ever, because all games have inspirations from others.
[2017-03-02 00:24:06 UTC] darksydephil: okay well im off to upload. hope you guys check out my impressions vid tonight and see you all tomorrow
[2017-03-02 00:24:07 UTC] chocobotamer: Witcher has boring combat? danHmm
[2017-03-02 00:24:07 UTC] skysands2017: This is why I don't trust western games. Overhyped by media, then it turns out to be generic boring game.
[2017-03-02 00:24:08 UTC] johnnyzee_s: there IS an influence on your gameplay
[2017-03-02 00:24:09 UTC] drilbit777: Well idk if you would like Zelda considering the main point of the game is exploration
[2017-03-02 00:24:11 UTC] playcool18: probably the gameplay will get better, the more unique the monster you find
[2017-03-02 00:24:12 UTC] johnnyzee_s: You shouldn't deny it Phil
[2017-03-02 00:24:17 UTC] amplitory2: Lol true. I just remember watching DSP suffer through ghostbusters and I felt so bad cuz he was a fun of the series
[2017-03-02 00:24:23 UTC] drilbit777: Not something you rush btw
[2017-03-02 00:24:27 UTC] codenameone: @PimpleFacedPantySniffer Yeah the way the gaming industry has been going in the past five+ years has been disgusting.
[2017-03-02 00:24:30 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Chat sucks and streaming has changed your gameplay for the worse imo and many people agree
[2017-03-02 00:24:35 UTC] kinggoken: I'll watch the video dsp
[2017-03-02 00:24:37 UTC] playcool18: yes, dsp considered TW3 combat boring, but many loved it, opinions
[2017-03-02 00:24:38 UTC] mattyessendon: You want genuine advice Phil? So this part time. You are stressed out with life that you're not enjoying the games put forward to you. I'm a streamer myself and when you're not enjoying, or stressing out over things, people see it.
[2017-03-02 00:24:44 UTC] mattyessendon: Do*
[2017-03-02 00:24:44 UTC] playcool18: I loved TW 3 combat
[2017-03-02 00:24:49 UTC] johnnyzee_s: chat is 99% of the time WORTHLESS
[2017-03-02 00:24:54 UTC] tedicoz: why for the love of god is there no hand holding rule
[2017-03-02 00:24:57 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: Video Game industry has this hidden agenda like hollywood. Just slimey
[2017-03-02 00:25:08 UTC] johnnyzee_s: you already don't interact
[2017-03-02 00:25:11 UTC] tedicoz: it is quite obvious at times, you are getting backseated by chat
[2017-03-02 00:25:12 UTC] johnnyzee_s: but you still read it
[2017-03-02 00:25:16 UTC] johnnyzee_s: and it changes your gameplay
[2017-03-02 00:25:18 UTC] amplitory2: @Johnnyzee_s I dont agree though. I enjoy DSP streaming 100%
[2017-03-02 00:25:18 UTC] johnnyzee_s: just turn it off
[2017-03-02 00:25:24 UTC] johnnyzee_s: streaming is fine
[2017-03-02 00:25:28 UTC] johnnyzee_s: that isn't the issue
[2017-03-02 00:25:33 UTC] johnnyzee_s: the issue is the affect the chat has on him
[2017-03-02 00:25:33 UTC] destinyzx1: I'm a streamer too and I enjoy what I do.
[2017-03-02 00:25:34 UTC] johnnyzee_s: see he just left
[2017-03-02 00:25:37 UTC] playcool18: jonnhy dont say many, more like say you, I dont feel like that, not at all
[2017-03-02 00:25:38 UTC] chocobotamer: Wait, if I think differently from someone, I'm stupid doo doo head? danHmm
[2017-03-02 00:25:41 UTC] johnnyzee_s: instead of staying to contest his point of view
[2017-03-02 00:25:45 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: do you not speak in complete sentences @Johnnyzee_s
[2017-03-02 00:25:47 UTC] johnnyzee_s: it's kind of ridiculous how he doesn't care man
[2017-03-02 00:25:48 UTC] destinyzx1: The problem is that Phil takes things way too seriously. You need to lay back, relax and go with the flow.
[2017-03-02 00:25:53 UTC] destinyzx1: knowing him, he probably won't.
[2017-03-02 00:25:55 UTC] broganahd: ^
[2017-03-02 00:25:57 UTC] amplitory2: I just like seeing someone live ya know?
[2017-03-02 00:25:59 UTC] kinggoken: DSP seems pretty chill when he is streaming
[2017-03-02 00:25:59 UTC] cerulean_86: @DarksydePhil the only reason you disliek the game is you have low views for it. You are not capable of being objective because all you care about is views / money
[2017-03-02 00:26:05 UTC] kinggoken: its the haters that bring out the worst in him
[2017-03-02 00:26:14 UTC] destinyzx1: if views are all you care about Phil then you've already lost.
[2017-03-02 00:26:14 UTC] tedicoz: what we need is a no back seating rule
[2017-03-02 00:26:19 UTC] tedicoz: my friends
[2017-03-02 00:26:23 UTC] kinggoken: those dudes who create hour long videos bashing him. That stuff needs to stop
[2017-03-02 00:26:26 UTC] alex_dragonul: @DarksydePhil don't worry man is the game , don't listen to those people
[2017-03-02 00:26:29 UTC] destinyzx1: you shouldn't care about views. I don't and I've been doing this a lot longer than you by two years.
[2017-03-02 00:26:39 UTC] tedicoz: and btw, horizon zero dawn is trash my dude
[2017-03-02 00:26:41 UTC] johnnyzee_s: a lot of the hate is justified TBH. He doesn't read a lot of things and he does the wrong thing seemingly on purpose and takes the long way around all the time
[2017-03-02 00:26:45 UTC] chocobotamer: But wait, if you never interact with chat, what's the point of streaming to begin with danHmm
[2017-03-02 00:26:55 UTC] playcool18: dsp said he was gone to upload the vids, guess you didnt heard, it is not like he can stay here all day long pointless arguing with people like jonnhy
[2017-03-02 00:26:58 UTC] kinggoken: he does interact with chat lol
[2017-03-02 00:27:05 UTC] tedicoz: sum ugly ginger we playing as
[2017-03-02 00:27:05 UTC] amplitory2: @Kinggoken those people secretely love him. To spend all day making vids about one person.. is just..
[2017-03-02 00:27:09 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: Phil needs to tap into the political market Kappa
[2017-03-02 00:27:11 UTC] destinyzx1: yeah but phil is one poor stubborn boy who doesn't get it
[2017-03-02 00:27:12 UTC] kinggoken: lol @amplitory2
[2017-03-02 00:27:12 UTC] mattyessendon: @kinggoken bashing him? You mean TIHYDP's
[2017-03-02 00:27:16 UTC] destinyzx1: it's a reason why the hate he gers is justified
[2017-03-02 00:27:20 UTC] destinyzx1: *gets
[2017-03-02 00:27:23 UTC] kinggoken: not just the this is how you don't play videos
[2017-03-02 00:27:30 UTC] tedicoz: sum ugly named aloy
[2017-03-02 00:27:32 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: Isn't he making a politics channel?
[2017-03-02 00:27:33 UTC] tedicoz: KEK
[2017-03-02 00:27:34 UTC] kinggoken: there is a group of people who make videos every week bashign dsp. Very sick.
[2017-03-02 00:27:37 UTC] johnnyzee_s: like
[2017-03-02 00:27:41 UTC] johnnyzee_s: he didn't read the HL tutorial
[2017-03-02 00:27:42 UTC] indahood21: Stop those tihydp videos
[2017-03-02 00:27:43 UTC] johnnyzee_s: about crouch jumping
[2017-03-02 00:27:45 UTC] johnnyzee_s: and he wasted an hour
[2017-03-02 00:27:46 UTC] destinyzx1: it's not that it's sick. it's all legit.
[2017-03-02 00:27:48 UTC] mattyessendon: @kinggoken he seems to have no problem trying to make a buck off them videos.
[2017-03-02 00:27:49 UTC] amplitory2: @Kinggoken I think what perplexed me the most is seeing people have meetings for hours talking about him on YT. so sad..
[2017-03-02 00:27:53 UTC] destinyzx1: and if you want to bash me for it, be my guest.
[2017-03-02 00:27:57 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: Politics on youtube is the biggest growing thing right now
[2017-03-02 00:28:00 UTC] tedicoz: how is it sick if it is his footage?
[2017-03-02 00:28:10 UTC] chocobotamer: A politics channel? Look out for that advertisement unfriendly tag danHmm
[2017-03-02 00:28:16 UTC] destinyzx1: yep
[2017-03-02 00:28:23 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Kinggoken, you seem obsessed with the detractors.
[2017-03-02 00:28:27 UTC] kinggoken: its sick because those people should be doing better things with their time. Not bashing someone else.
[2017-03-02 00:28:33 UTC] mattyessendon: @kinggoken all he needs to do is to go on that podcast and address it with them. But he won't do that, because he likes to pick on the little guy.
[2017-03-02 00:28:42 UTC] playcool18: this is getting pointless, gotta go too, goodnight guys
[2017-03-02 00:28:45 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Phil if you're still reading the chat, you proved my point
[2017-03-02 00:28:48 UTC] tedicoz: doesn't take that long to make a tihydp my man
[2017-03-02 00:28:50 UTC] destinyzx1: the bashing phil gets is well deserved because honestly, phil has been dropping considerably
[2017-03-02 00:28:55 UTC] destinyzx1: and yet he blames everyone but himself
[2017-03-02 00:28:56 UTC] krext45: dsp you little shit, you need to hear some truths about your crappy channel
[2017-03-02 00:28:57 UTC] amplitory2: @Johnnyzee_s you gotta admit that was funny as hell tho
[2017-03-02 00:29:07 UTC] codenameone: @PimpleFacedPantySniffer I would actually be interested in a DSP politics channel. I followed a gaming Youtuber who also held a podcast where he talked politics, news, etc and he was profoundly intelligent, tactful, and verbose. I loved it.
[2017-03-02 00:29:08 UTC] destinyzx1: a true man accepts his failures and live with them
[2017-03-02 00:29:11 UTC] misterlightningbolt: Phil really should go on the sokast for public relations and to actually open up a dialogue with the detractors
[2017-03-02 00:29:16 UTC] krext45: first off your commentary is pitiful
[2017-03-02 00:29:25 UTC] krext45: second of all your attitude stinks
[2017-03-02 00:29:25 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: who is that? @CodenameOne
[2017-03-02 00:29:27 UTC] destinyzx1: I've done some things wrong and at least I try to amend for my mistakes
[2017-03-02 00:29:32 UTC] tedicoz: love how the first argument is always, "WAISTING THEIR LIFE"
[2017-03-02 00:29:35 UTC] redworld13: "profoundly intelligent, tactful, and verbose." sounds like dsp Kappa
[2017-03-02 00:29:37 UTC] darksydephil: who are these retards
[2017-03-02 00:29:39 UTC] johnnyzee_s: @amplitory2, no, it ruined the playthrough, i can't watch it because i know i'll be pissed off cause he clearly doesn't see the tutorial TEACH HIM how to crouch jump
[2017-03-02 00:29:42 UTC] lesterwastaken: idk
[2017-03-02 00:29:43 UTC] darksydephil: i said iw as leaving lol
[2017-03-02 00:29:52 UTC] cerulean_86: @DarksydePhil If you had tons of viewers for Horizon Zero Dawn you would say its a great game. However, you bitch about it endlessly and without reason simply because your views are low. Pathetic.
[2017-03-02 00:29:53 UTC] mattyessendon: @darksydephil you referring to me?
[2017-03-02 00:29:55 UTC] darksydephil: i move to the desktop and glance over, a slew of idiot kids insulting me? yeah fuck no
[2017-03-02 00:29:57 UTC] codenameone: @PimpleFacedPantySniffer The Youtuber was LeftyOX. He no longer does Youtube, sadly.
[2017-03-02 00:30:13 UTC] kingjadvcmp: hi Phil, what's wrong?
[2017-03-02 00:30:17 UTC] bigbadbeardo: Phil is a piss monkey
[2017-03-02 00:30:25 UTC] mattyessendon: @darksydephil I'm 23 and never insulted you. Just stated facts.
[2017-03-02 00:30:25 UTC] codenameone: Benned.
[2017-03-02 00:30:28 UTC] darksydephil: i guess someone sent in the clowns haha
[2017-03-02 00:30:31 UTC] tedicoz: phil, question for you my man
[2017-03-02 00:30:37 UTC] cplkevlar: Okay I'm back, whats up?
[2017-03-02 00:30:39 UTC] mindless_sinner: kaceyFace
[2017-03-02 00:30:41 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: They are paid protesters
[2017-03-02 00:30:48 UTC] drilbit777: capcomRyu capcomHadouken
[2017-03-02 00:30:57 UTC] tedicoz: is there gonna be a rule for no backseating?
[2017-03-02 00:30:57 UTC] amplitory2: Dude why does a gamer have to be super amazing and never make a mistake? Entertainment is what we want. He's not playing SV anymore
[2017-03-02 00:31:01 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: George Soros funded shills!
[2017-03-02 00:31:07 UTC] broganahd: I like how someone has a decent opinion, but is still called an idiot kid.
[2017-03-02 00:31:17 UTC] skysands2017: WHO LET THE CLOWNS OUT
[2017-03-02 00:31:18 UTC] tedicoz: please we need a no backseating rule
[2017-03-02 00:31:19 UTC] darksydephil: i like how you're banned
[2017-03-02 00:31:21 UTC] darksydephil: lol
[2017-03-02 00:31:24 UTC] misterlightningbolt: haha
[2017-03-02 00:31:26 UTC] indahood21: @darksydephil why do u even listen to these little kids fam
[2017-03-02 00:31:29 UTC] lesterwastaken: dat banhammer tho lol
[2017-03-02 00:31:34 UTC] darksydephil: who is backseating in this game? the game is seriously easy
[2017-03-02 00:31:36 UTC] kingjadvcmp: skysands, weren't you calling people autistic earlier on TKOH?
[2017-03-02 00:31:38 UTC] codenameone: Clowns and the Stupid Squad.
[2017-03-02 00:31:38 UTC] darksydephil: i have no need to backseat
[2017-03-02 00:31:38 UTC] itstommytakeover: :( its so hard being phil from phily
[2017-03-02 00:31:42 UTC] tedicoz: well not this game, but others
[2017-03-02 00:31:45 UTC] mattyessendon: @darksydephil good way to run your business man.
[2017-03-02 00:31:58 UTC] darksydephil: yes, banning dumbfuck kids is a great way to run my business
[2017-03-02 00:31:59 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: This game seems linear
[2017-03-02 00:32:00 UTC] codenameone: Another one bites the dust.
[2017-03-02 00:32:00 UTC] drilbit777: Hopefully you take the time to enjoy Zelda since it's a game that's very atmospheric
[2017-03-02 00:32:03 UTC] mindless_sinner: Isn't it time to leave the office? you've busted your arse today kaceyFace
[2017-03-02 00:32:03 UTC] darksydephil: because i dont need their troll bullshit
[2017-03-02 00:32:08 UTC] drilbit777: It's about exploration after all
[2017-03-02 00:32:24 UTC] chocobotamer: Valid opinion = troll bullshit? danHmm
[2017-03-02 00:32:30 UTC] kinggoken: lol @CodenameOne
[2017-03-02 00:32:38 UTC] sirjamesdtech: How do you know everyone who disagrees with you is a kid?
[2017-03-02 00:32:42 UTC] itstommytakeover: I thought you let the hate fuel you. So isn't this negativity a good thing? just be happy and except it lol.
[2017-03-02 00:32:44 UTC] redworld13: Up = Down
[2017-03-02 00:32:49 UTC] johnnyzee_s: when you turn off the stream it makes your content different, more personal
[2017-03-02 00:32:50 UTC] amplitory2: DSP is one of the few and only streamers who arent fake as fuck and doesnt take shit from kids on the internet #respect and glad he sticks by it
[2017-03-02 00:32:50 UTC] tedicoz: Like, I guess you could say. I go out of my way to make sure there's no backseating happening in this chat. FEELSGOODman
[2017-03-02 00:33:08 UTC] johnnyzee_s: you connect differently

[2017-03-02 00:33:22 UTC] misterlightningbolt: What about a wwe sim patreon battle royal? People give an amount of $, link you to their caw, and they all compete in a battle royal?
[2017-03-02 00:33:22 UTC] johnnyzee_s: try it man
[2017-03-02 00:33:37 UTC] indahood21: @tedicoz shut yo dumb ass up dawg

[2017-03-02 00:33:59 UTC] amplitory2: @zybatzuu Yeah, it pretty much is. Just cuz he might of not met a goal one time in his life doesn't mean hes a liar

[2017-03-02 00:36:14 UTC] cplkevlar: Word is he lurks and is a male identified person
[2017-03-02 00:36:16 UTC] amplitory2: Tevins cool except can he admit he loves DSP?
[2017-03-02 00:36:32 UTC] amplitory2: cuz if i had a channel about 1 dude
[2017-03-02 00:36:34 UTC] kinggoken: isn't he one of those guys that makes the hour long videos about dsp? Talk about obsessed lol.
[2017-03-02 00:36:35 UTC] amplitory2: I would have to admit it
[2017-03-02 00:36:36 UTC] misterlightningbolt: When Tevin shaved his head i had the urge for a cadurys cr√®me egg
[2017-03-02 00:36:45 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Kinggoken you know a LOT about detractors it seems.
[2017-03-02 00:36:47 UTC] kingjadvcmp: obsessive much?
[2017-03-02 00:36:49 UTC] indahood21: If you fuck with dsp im going rob you im his boduguard u feel me
[2017-03-02 00:36:51 UTC] kinggoken: i know nothing
[2017-03-02 00:36:56 UTC] kingjadvcmp: you keep talking about them
[2017-03-02 00:36:57 UTC] extremelycutepanda: is it true dsp bought his daughter a fake wedding ring ?
[2017-03-02 00:37:00 UTC] codenameone: @Kinggoken Nah he's not obsessed. Tevin's too legit.
[2017-03-02 00:37:01 UTC] kingjadvcmp: you seem to know a lot about what they do
[2017-03-02 00:37:11 UTC] lagfairy0: Tevin is a chocolate man.
[2017-03-02 00:37:29 UTC] sirjamesdtech: Tevin's like the rest of us "dumbfuck kids"...we just want Phil to improve. And stick to his word, and follow the rules.
[2017-03-02 00:37:31 UTC] amplitory2: @CodenameOne but I atleast want the detractors to admit they admire him in some way. Or they wouldnt be doing this
[2017-03-02 00:37:32 UTC] indahood21: Codename shut yo dirty ass up boi
[2017-03-02 00:37:33 UTC] rickforthewin: @extremelycutepanda she had to buy it herself FeelsBadMan
[2017-03-02 00:37:41 UTC] cplkevlar: ^
[2017-03-02 00:37:41 UTC] ilemaster: Is SaltSydePhil still here? ;D
[2017-03-02 00:37:42 UTC] cplkevlar: Dude
[2017-03-02 00:38:01 UTC] cplkevlar: That does feel bad
[2017-03-02 00:38:18 UTC] indahood21: Codename i bet you are a iduzz fan stfu! Dawg
[2017-03-02 00:38:18 UTC] codenameone: @amplitory2 Nah that's not how it is.
[2017-03-02 00:38:25 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I dunno if it's fair to blame the game for the views, other streamers seem to be doing fairly decently with it? Just searched there.
[2017-03-02 00:38:33 UTC] codenameone: "iduzz"? Wut? Huh?
[2017-03-02 00:38:35 UTC] tedicoz: xaxaxaxaxax,
[2017-03-02 00:38:45 UTC] darksydephil: people don't watch top twitch streamers for the games KingjadVCMP
[2017-03-02 00:38:51 UTC] darksydephil: that's become quite obvious hasn't it?
[2017-03-02 00:39:01 UTC] indahood21: Codename is a idubbs fan get off dsp stream boi
[2017-03-02 00:39:08 UTC] tedicoz: philbert, when are you going back to for HONOR
[2017-03-02 00:39:12 UTC] tedicoz: sooo good
[2017-03-02 00:39:16 UTC] cplkevlar: I can't wait to have sex after this holy shit watching this is depressing
[2017-03-02 00:39:19 UTC] kinggoken: i thought he hated for honor lol
[2017-03-02 00:39:25 UTC] tedicoz: he did?
[2017-03-02 00:39:26 UTC] drilbit777: @cplkevlar, Have sex with your waifu?
[2017-03-02 00:39:28 UTC] drilbit777: Kappa
[2017-03-02 00:39:30 UTC] codenameone: For Honor was booty.
[2017-03-02 00:39:32 UTC] amplitory2: for shame haha
[2017-03-02 00:39:33 UTC] cplkevlar: Noooooooooo...........
[2017-03-02 00:39:33 UTC] nightbot: cplkevlar -> Please do not spam symbols, thanks. [warning]
[2017-03-02 00:39:35 UTC] kinggoken: he made a review of it
[2017-03-02 00:39:39 UTC] codenameone: For Shame, as Phil called it.
[2017-03-02 00:39:44 UTC] amplitory2: @Kinggoken it actually does suck tbh
[2017-03-02 00:39:44 UTC] kinggoken: i can't link it though
[2017-03-02 00:39:44 UTC] freshjiivetv: is DSP on break
[2017-03-02 00:39:45 UTC] tedicoz: he can still go back right
[2017-03-02 00:39:49 UTC] freshjiivetv: or is the stream before
[2017-03-02 00:39:50 UTC] capstonegaming: yeah dsp is on break
[2017-03-02 00:39:51 UTC] drilbit777: Should have called it No Honor lol
[2017-03-02 00:39:51 UTC] cplkevlar: Damn nightbot
[2017-03-02 00:39:53 UTC] redworld13: For shame lmao, thats so fucking clever
[2017-03-02 00:39:57 UTC] drilbit777: Thats far more catchy
[2017-03-02 00:39:59 UTC] indahood21: For Honor is Trash
[2017-03-02 00:40:03 UTC] amplitory2: ^^^
[2017-03-02 00:40:07 UTC] capstonegaming: ;)
[2017-03-02 00:40:11 UTC] tedicoz: well is yakuza 0 any better?
[2017-03-02 00:40:15 UTC] cplkevlar: No waifu just local Peurto Rican thot
[2017-03-02 00:40:18 UTC] kinggoken: yakuza 0 is amazing
[2017-03-02 00:40:20 UTC] lagfairy0: Any update from jewtube?
[2017-03-02 00:40:24 UTC] kingjadvcmp: For Honour is a fun multiplayer game IMO, but for those who are used to the single-player experiences I can understand frustrations
[2017-03-02 00:40:32 UTC] tedicoz: is that just cause its a weeb game?
[2017-03-02 00:40:37 UTC] oinkerbob: Will you be posting a vlog tonight after dinner?
[2017-03-02 00:40:43 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: 6
[2017-03-02 00:40:49 UTC] amplitory2: I seriously wanna see phil play dead by daylight. I know I've said this before but if you guys know the game, its a horror game and it's amazingly entertaining to watch
[2017-03-02 00:40:51 UTC] codenameone: Even if the game is fun, there's still the issue of the framerate.
[2017-03-02 00:40:56 UTC] cplkevlar: Ohhhh a vlog would be nice while I smash
[2017-03-02 00:41:07 UTC] amplitory2: except its PC only atm :/
[2017-03-02 00:41:10 UTC] drilbit777: The issue with for honor is the servers
[2017-03-02 00:41:16 UTC] drilbit777: P2P is dogshit
[2017-03-02 00:41:16 UTC] amplitory2: @cplkevlar you smash?
[2017-03-02 00:41:22 UTC] kinggoken: lol @tedicoz
[2017-03-02 00:41:23 UTC] cplkevlar: Yep
[2017-03-02 00:41:24 UTC] startingfromscratch: DbD wouldn't work well for Phil's style - unless he does kill with friends w/ subs or patreon donors
[2017-03-02 00:41:29 UTC] cplkevlar: haha
[2017-03-02 00:41:31 UTC] drilbit777: He smashes with his waifu
[2017-03-02 00:41:34 UTC] indahood21: Phil you got to play ghost recon wildlands
[2017-03-02 00:41:35 UTC] cplkevlar: Haha
[2017-03-02 00:41:37 UTC] kinggoken: nah the game is just amazing. Good story, good graphics, good gameplay and tons of stuff to do in the game.
[2017-03-02 00:41:39 UTC] codenameone: @Drilbit777 Right, and the P2P servers. That is terrible.
[2017-03-02 00:41:44 UTC] sirjamesdtech: I'm glad you've come to the realization that the number of eyeballs tends to correlate to the quality of the content creator.
[2017-03-02 00:41:56 UTC] amplitory2: @Startingfromscratch yes but imagine him running from the killer and learning the game. There would be some priceless moments I feel
[2017-03-02 00:42:04 UTC] tedicoz: he will despise wild lands once he realizes it is the division
[2017-03-02 00:42:06 UTC] amplitory2: I strongly recommend it for him. But I'm just some random dude.
[2017-03-02 00:42:25 UTC] amplitory2: @cplkevlar you mean like smash bros?
[2017-03-02 00:42:33 UTC] alex_dragonul: i think johnny might be a troll
[2017-03-02 00:42:37 UTC] indahood21: Ghost recon wildlands is like metal gear solid
[2017-03-02 00:42:42 UTC] tedicoz: really?
[2017-03-02 00:42:50 UTC] ai_ixtab: When's Marvel???
[2017-03-02 00:42:50 UTC] codenameone: I want Phil to play Valkyria Chronicles, but that would get horrible views and the game is pretty damn long, so it'd be for the Summer.
[2017-03-02 00:43:03 UTC] tedicoz: nah phil needs to go back to kotor
[2017-03-02 00:43:04 UTC] startingfromscratch: @amplitory2 Until he deals with the infinite login bugs devs never fix, or the legitimately broken match making that puts him with a rank 1 killer while he has no perks. Tons of salt, so could be good depending on what you want.
[2017-03-02 00:43:04 UTC] capstonegaming: phil got real mad
[2017-03-02 00:43:10 UTC] capstonegaming: :
[2017-03-02 00:43:10 UTC] tedicoz: WE need KOTOR
[2017-03-02 00:43:17 UTC] capstonegaming: ^^^
[2017-03-02 00:43:24 UTC] sonsofkojima1: i heard dsp was being really toxic today
[2017-03-02 00:43:27 UTC] tedicoz: he did get both on the og xbox
[2017-03-02 00:43:29 UTC] capstonegaming: HAs phil played kotor yet??
[2017-03-02 00:43:31 UTC] kinggoken: he was chill on stream
[2017-03-02 00:43:39 UTC] amplitory2: @Startingfromscratch they fixed it for the most part to be honest. Like inifinite loading screen was fixed. its just lobby issues sometimes
[2017-03-02 00:43:40 UTC] indahood21: I want see phil rage on ghost recon wildlands cause of the stealth lol
[2017-03-02 00:43:41 UTC] tedicoz: he started the first one
[2017-03-02 00:43:47 UTC] tedicoz: never got far
[2017-03-02 00:43:48 UTC] capstonegaming: needs to play more nsotalgic games
[2017-03-02 00:43:59 UTC] tedicoz: the game was glitching for him or something
[2017-03-02 00:44:11 UTC] tedicoz: still, needs to go back and play it tbh
[2017-03-02 00:44:13 UTC] startingfromscratch: @amplitory2, if that's the case, then yeah that could work. I hadn't played in about a month or so.
[2017-03-02 00:44:20 UTC] sonsofkojima1: why was he getting mad later in the stream?
[2017-03-02 00:44:35 UTC] amplitory2: @Startingfromscratch just imagine phils first reaction when the killer see's him haha.
[2017-03-02 00:44:35 UTC] kinggoken: it was after stream was already over
[2017-03-02 00:44:40 UTC] kinggoken: and it was because of a troll
[2017-03-02 00:44:40 UTC] sonsofkojima1: oh ok
[2017-03-02 00:44:44 UTC] codenameone: The combat in Horizon is booty and he was really disliking that.
[2017-03-02 00:44:51 UTC] darksydephil: i didnt start streaming until 2013, but ive kept my content as if i'm doing a playthrough for youtube. it's a definite different kind of stuff and the common Twitch viewer doesn't even get it. the first thing people say is "why isn't he constantly talking to stream chat?!?!" like that's EXPECTED from someone on twitch lol. and that's a joke
[2017-03-02 00:44:52 UTC] sirjamesdtech: Maybe Philly got some bad news from YouTube. I know! Play the happy whistling song. It always gets everyone in such a skippy mood.
[2017-03-02 00:44:54 UTC] retropetey: hey @DarksydePhil are you making a video tonight with the update from youtube and machinima?
[2017-03-02 00:45:04 UTC] kinggoken: whoa dsp is still here
[2017-03-02 00:45:07 UTC] startingfromscratch: @amplitory2, first myers match when he's on ev1. no terror radius. instant classic potential.
[2017-03-02 00:45:13 UTC] tedicoz: @DarksydePhil are you going back to KOTOR
[2017-03-02 00:45:14 UTC] darksydephil: oh look, a "sub" got banned for being a douchebag. goodbye, douchebag
[2017-03-02 00:45:27 UTC] darksydephil: i swear, some people think that makes htem immune and able to just sit here insult me. fuck off lol
[2017-03-02 00:45:28 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: yeah when is the vlog
[2017-03-02 00:45:33 UTC] majestic_seven: Sadly he won't listen to any of those suggestions
[2017-03-02 00:45:39 UTC] sonsofkojima1: phil just do twitch ur own way
[2017-03-02 00:45:43 UTC] indahood21: @dsp u know horizon is assassin creed rip off
[2017-03-02 00:45:48 UTC] amplitory2: @Startingfromscratch exactly. I feel like it'd be great. I play MM myself and know what you mean
[2017-03-02 00:45:53 UTC] tedicoz: you never finished the first one man
[2017-03-02 00:46:00 UTC] tedicoz: you just left KOTOR hanging
[2017-03-02 00:46:33 UTC] darksydephil: hanging?
[2017-03-02 00:46:37 UTC] darksydephil: the game wouldn't run anymor eon my PC lol
[2017-03-02 00:46:46 UTC] tedicoz: you got them on og xbox right
[2017-03-02 00:46:49 UTC] sonsofkojima1: phil have u considered IRL on twitch? its the hot new thing
[2017-03-02 00:47:15 UTC] indahood21: @DarksydePhil you got play ghost recon wildlands one day it coming out soon
[2017-03-02 00:47:17 UTC] lagfairy0: Too bad Zelda won't bring in the views. nintendo fans hate your stuff.
[2017-03-02 00:47:19 UTC] tedicoz: I know you posted a photo one time with both of the games, original xbox version
[2017-03-02 00:47:21 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: @DarksydePhil Not sure if you answered this yet, but you were considering a political series for a long time. Any updates on that, it would be pretty interesting I think given the current climate.
[2017-03-02 00:47:30 UTC] sonsofkojima1: zelda is getting 10/10 from all media
[2017-03-02 00:47:36 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well Phil, if you know what the common Twitch viewer is like, will you try to adapt to suit what you think they prefer, or stick to how you are currently?
[2017-03-02 00:47:39 UTC] capstonegaming: Dsp type in "random Game generator" to google then just play that game
[2017-03-02 00:47:44 UTC] cplkevlar: Why not be a fulltime Vlogger, those videos seem to get plenty of views. Do game reviews on the side since KOgaming is doing good.
[2017-03-02 00:47:47 UTC] ai_ixtab: #ForeverMADBrah?
[2017-03-02 00:47:52 UTC] tedicoz: maybe, play conan exiles
[2017-03-02 00:48:01 UTC] kinggoken: people actually giving good ideas!
[2017-03-02 00:48:05 UTC] sonsofkojima1: conan looks so fun
[2017-03-02 00:48:08 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: ^
[2017-03-02 00:48:16 UTC] darksydephil: nothing is going to bring in the views. nintendo fanboys are too stupid to understand that my criticisms of the company aren't hate. People are already shitting all over Ghost Recon. ME won't live up to the first trilogy so people will dumb on that. there's an excuse why everything I play is bad, for some reason, when i play it but nobody else!
[2017-03-02 00:48:23 UTC] tedicoz: yeah, conan exiles, try it out @DarksydePhil
[2017-03-02 00:48:29 UTC] majestic_seven: He won't listen to any suggestions
[2017-03-02 00:48:41 UTC] indahood21: @DarkSydePhil play final fantasy 4
[2017-03-02 00:48:52 UTC] cplkevlar: Calling fans of something stupid is a really bad way to get new customers (viewers)
[2017-03-02 00:49:09 UTC] kingjadvcmp: fair point
[2017-03-02 00:49:11 UTC] amplitory2: I like these suggestions people are saying myself. BUT I do still enjoy the fact that Phil always sticks to raw gameplay and streams it as it were a YT video. I see no problem in him having more concentration on the game
[2017-03-02 00:49:12 UTC] capstonegaming: playing all these games and paying for them all is gonna be costly i think tekken comes out soon as well
[2017-03-02 00:49:19 UTC] tedicoz: well mass effect just looks bad
[2017-03-02 00:49:23 UTC] tedicoz: no other way to put it
[2017-03-02 00:49:25 UTC] indahood21: Final fantasy 4 is amazing
[2017-03-02 00:49:27 UTC] toblo1: Theres a line between "I don't like a thing" and "Fuck you for liking a thing"
[2017-03-02 00:49:28 UTC] cplkevlar: Is Tekken still a thing?
[2017-03-02 00:49:29 UTC] capstonegaming: too many games
[2017-03-02 00:49:34 UTC] toblo1: Something you can't figure out
[2017-03-02 00:49:39 UTC] capstonegaming: Tekken > SF V right now
[2017-03-02 00:49:46 UTC] ai_ixtab: But even if u were in the arcade, u NVER put a arcade game
[2017-03-02 00:49:49 UTC] misterlightningbolt: Tekken 7 im really looking forward to
[2017-03-02 00:49:50 UTC] freshjiivetv: I think a good game for Phil to play would be Wildlands
[2017-03-02 00:49:52 UTC] kinggoken: lol I used to call Tekken...Sukken
[2017-03-02 00:49:53 UTC] freshjiivetv: but i think he's playing that soon
[2017-03-02 00:49:56 UTC] sonsofkojima1: is phil playing zelda on friday?
[2017-03-02 00:49:58 UTC] kinggoken: because it sucked
[2017-03-02 00:49:58 UTC] capstonegaming: yeah tekken 7 is butter
[2017-03-02 00:50:03 UTC] indahood21: Phil play final fantasy 4 u will like it
[2017-03-02 00:50:15 UTC] kinggoken: i think dsp will get high view numbers for Zelda
[2017-03-02 00:50:22 UTC] capstonegaming: everybody will
[2017-03-02 00:50:23 UTC] tedicoz: nah @DarksydePhil play conan exiles. then you can be a naked guy with his dick hanging out
[2017-03-02 00:50:23 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: @DarksydePhil how big do you think tee spring will be?
[2017-03-02 00:50:26 UTC] sonsofkojima1: i agree king
[2017-03-02 00:50:31 UTC] tedicoz: SHItty dicks!!!
[2017-03-02 00:50:35 UTC] capstonegaming: but there must be a gimmick of some sort to add exrra individuality to phils stream
[2017-03-02 00:50:36 UTC] majestic_seven: I bet you it won't @kinggoken
[2017-03-02 00:50:39 UTC] kinggoken: :(
[2017-03-02 00:50:46 UTC] amplitory2: I still have this crutch that if he streamed DBD it would get good notice no matter what lol
[2017-03-02 00:50:50 UTC] capstonegaming: otherwise "eeewwoooo" ( makes down slant)
[2017-03-02 00:50:50 UTC] sonsofkojima1: i heard some people say phil will sell 50+ shirts on tee spring!
[2017-03-02 00:51:06 UTC] capstonegaming: Death counter on zelda?
[2017-03-02 00:51:08 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: It would be fun to see DSP play a more different kind of game like Rust, League of Legends, Arma 3.
[2017-03-02 00:51:10 UTC] freshjiivetv: I can't wait to buy some merch. I hope they have my size
[2017-03-02 00:51:20 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I reckon he'll manage over 50, personally, it'll initially be well received I reckon since people are working hard for him with artwork
[2017-03-02 00:51:21 UTC] capstonegaming: How bout a timer? o__0
[2017-03-02 00:51:24 UTC] tedicoz: he should play nier
[2017-03-02 00:51:30 UTC] indahood21: DarkSydePhil is the Darth vader of gaming tho
[2017-03-02 00:51:34 UTC] kinggoken: i would be interested in watching dsp playing league of legends
[2017-03-02 00:51:43 UTC] amplitory2: @Teslawasrobbedac1 I can actually see that working. Those are games sort of more like DBD, you know, steam games.
[2017-03-02 00:51:47 UTC] tedicoz: yeah that'd be great
[2017-03-02 00:51:47 UTC] misterlightningbolt: Id wanna see DSP do a Gran Turismo game
[2017-03-02 00:52:00 UTC] capstonegaming: goood quick games
[2017-03-02 00:52:03 UTC] toblo1: He tried playing Drakengard 3. Look how that ended up.
[2017-03-02 00:52:04 UTC] tedicoz: people would flame him on LOL
[2017-03-02 00:52:05 UTC] drilbit777: He said he doesnt want to play nier because apparently the fact the game is already out in japan so theres no interest
[2017-03-02 00:52:10 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Can you imagine DSP playing H1Z1 BR. That would be memes overload.
[2017-03-02 00:52:15 UTC] startingfromscratch: I think games that could set up easy multiplayer with patreon/sub members would work. His last twitch & chill seem to indicate that his interactive streams work well. Even if he sets up a different steam account just for that purpose.
[2017-03-02 00:52:17 UTC] soulrider95: So then why is he playing Persona 5? LUL
[2017-03-02 00:52:23 UTC] valomek: The day DSP gets a job, will be a great day.
[2017-03-02 00:52:28 UTC] kinggoken: yeah Nier is out in Japan already and it has an English dub
[2017-03-02 00:52:28 UTC] goldencolts: h1z1 is cancer though
[2017-03-02 00:52:29 UTC] drilbit777: The japanese version of nier came with the english dub/text btw
[2017-03-02 00:52:31 UTC] amplitory2: Lol DSP playing h1z1 would be fun to watch and I dont even play that
[2017-03-02 00:52:31 UTC] capstonegaming: Shenmue wouldbe the MAJOR game that phil needs to play
[2017-03-02 00:52:32 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: Great suggestion H1Z1
[2017-03-02 00:52:32 UTC] cplkevlar: The Nintendo Switch comes out on my bday, I'm excited tbh
[2017-03-02 00:52:40 UTC] tedicoz: Dsp playing a moba?
[2017-03-02 00:52:44 UTC] tedicoz: imagine that /b/ros
[2017-03-02 00:52:47 UTC] capstonegaming: Cheese meets cheese
[2017-03-02 00:52:47 UTC] kinggoken: lol
[2017-03-02 00:52:49 UTC] drilbit777: So thats why alot of people imported it while P5 is japanese voices/text only
[2017-03-02 00:52:53 UTC] indahood21: @DarkSydePhil if you play final fantasy 4 u will bring in millon of views
[2017-03-02 00:52:53 UTC] amplitory2: @CapstoneGaming I was just asking this on his yakuza stream the other day! shenmue was great!
[2017-03-02 00:52:54 UTC] sonsofkojima1: he's played mobas before he didn't like them
[2017-03-02 00:52:55 UTC] soulrider95: I'm more interested in NieR than Borekuza 5
[2017-03-02 00:52:55 UTC] tedicoz: FUCKING MId CYKA
[2017-03-02 00:52:57 UTC] cplkevlar: Stop breaking the 1st rule
[2017-03-02 00:53:02 UTC] misterlightningbolt: the redemption run of ds1 did great, im not sure why he didnt roll straight into another redemption run, there tons of infamous playthroughs that would get repeat views
[2017-03-02 00:53:15 UTC] kinggoken: has dsp played Shenmue before?
[2017-03-02 00:53:18 UTC] capstonegaming: phil needs to play something diferent than everybody else cuz....everybodys gonna be playing these new games
[2017-03-02 00:53:20 UTC] cplkevlar: ^
[2017-03-02 00:53:20 UTC] tedicoz: you got the russians flaming him in chat
[2017-03-02 00:53:22 UTC] cplkevlar: Kek
[2017-03-02 00:53:23 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: I feel like these games are way more interesting then Yakuza 0. Muliplayer games are always more interesting to watch then single player games.
[2017-03-02 00:53:36 UTC] sonsofkojima1: I hope dsp plays mLB
[2017-03-02 00:53:37 UTC] tedicoz: maybe he should try DayZ
[2017-03-02 00:53:40 UTC] tedicoz: hell yeah
[2017-03-02 00:53:48 UTC] codenameone: DSP's multiplayer streams are Godlike.
[2017-03-02 00:53:48 UTC] mynameismrrobot: Whoa
[2017-03-02 00:53:52 UTC] hikerout89: has Phil considered doing vlogs outside like at arcades, and possibly doing skits for his channel?
[2017-03-02 00:53:54 UTC] majestic_seven: "nothing is going to bring in views"
[2017-03-02 00:54:00 UTC] capstonegaming: or more multiplayer streams
[2017-03-02 00:54:05 UTC] capstonegaming: THAT WOULD MAKE MONEY
[2017-03-02 00:54:06 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: DSP + the gang, vs. the detractors in Rust. 10/10.
[2017-03-02 00:54:10 UTC] kinggoken: lol
[2017-03-02 00:54:12 UTC] tedicoz: get him to play rust with fans
[2017-03-02 00:54:12 UTC] capstonegaming: book matches with DSP
[2017-03-02 00:54:14 UTC] tedicoz: ^^^^^
[2017-03-02 00:54:14 UTC] indahood21: Final Fantasy 6 will also bring in the views of he plays that his stream would be lit
[2017-03-02 00:54:17 UTC] soulrider95: majestic_seven, Borekuza Zero Views certainly won't
[2017-03-02 00:54:18 UTC] capstonegaming: charge 5$ a match
[2017-03-02 00:54:22 UTC] tedicoz: rust with fans is a instant win boyz
[2017-03-02 00:54:33 UTC] amplitory2: Rust, Dead by daylight, Blackwake, all games that would be fun to watch
[2017-03-02 00:54:36 UTC] amplitory2: imagine blackwake
[2017-03-02 00:54:37 UTC] mynameismrrobot: Prank channel
[2017-03-02 00:54:39 UTC] startingfromscratch: Plus also that could be a legitimate patreon perk - he basically did that last interactive stream where he posted the game location in an area outside of most trolls.
[2017-03-02 00:54:41 UTC] kinggoken: i wonder if dsp is reading all of this
[2017-03-02 00:54:45 UTC] capstonegaming: imagine bloodwake on xbox
[2017-03-02 00:54:50 UTC] startingfromscratch: Or sub perk, whatever.
[2017-03-02 00:55:03 UTC] amplitory2: I wanna see DSP be a pirate and control a naval ship and shoot cannons
[2017-03-02 00:55:05 UTC] mynameismrrobot: Phil could do pranks
[2017-03-02 00:55:07 UTC] goldencolts: why everyone here so late, didnt stream end like half hour ago
[2017-03-02 00:55:16 UTC] kinggoken: the conversation kept on going lol
[2017-03-02 00:55:18 UTC] misterlightningbolt: the chat was more interesting than the stream
[2017-03-02 00:55:25 UTC] capstonegaming: Dark Sector there ya go
[2017-03-02 00:55:27 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Yeah, I mean these are unconventional games for him is the problem, that have a pretty high learning curve to do well.
[2017-03-02 00:55:29 UTC] kinggoken: thats how good dsp is
[2017-03-02 00:55:35 UTC] capstonegaming: play dark sector (shrugs) just play something different
[2017-03-02 00:55:39 UTC] goldencolts: was there some spicy a/s/l talk?
[2017-03-02 00:55:40 UTC] notbeawesomeone: Look at yourself Phil - you insult people that are giving you legit feedback, you insult regular users and you act like a cock overall and you still wonder why people don't wanna watch your streams and videos?
[2017-03-02 00:55:47 UTC] notbeawesomeone: Seriously man, wake up already
[2017-03-02 00:55:51 UTC] indahood21: Dsp should talk to the stream more often
[2017-03-02 00:55:54 UTC] tedicoz: PLAY ARMA 3
[2017-03-02 00:55:56 UTC] notbeawesomeone: It's your attitude that fucks you over
[2017-03-02 00:56:11 UTC] loryuo: true
[2017-03-02 00:56:11 UTC] geoffdaniels: He's gonna crash hard.
[2017-03-02 00:56:14 UTC] misterlightningbolt: phil doesn't really talk with us though, he talks at us
[2017-03-02 00:56:16 UTC] geoffdaniels: It won't be long.
[2017-03-02 00:56:21 UTC] kinggoken: lol
[2017-03-02 00:56:25 UTC] tedicoz: PLAY ELITE DANGEROUS OR STAR CITIZEN
[2017-03-02 00:56:35 UTC] hikerout89: notbeawesomeone wrong phil always tries to reach out but just gets abuse back
[2017-03-02 00:56:41 UTC] startingfromscratch: Star Citizen only if he has all the ships. Otherwise no views.
[2017-03-02 00:56:42 UTC] indahood21: I cant belive phil is in the chat tonight lol
[2017-03-02 00:56:55 UTC] majestic_seven: Place bets how long will it take I say April 27th
[2017-03-02 00:56:59 UTC] goldencolts: i cant believe the boys are back in town
[2017-03-02 00:57:00 UTC] tedicoz: doesn't star citizen charge major g's for ships
[2017-03-02 00:57:03 UTC] loryuo: he doesn't reach out until he reaches points of distaster
[2017-03-02 00:57:10 UTC] startingfromscratch: Yes - that's the joke.
[2017-03-02 00:57:15 UTC] tedicoz: patreon goal
[2017-03-02 00:57:18 UTC] mynameismrrobot: This may be Phil's last month
[2017-03-02 00:57:20 UTC] notbeawesomeone: @hikerout89 I saw the comments that he blocked few minutes ago. They were not anything mean or abusive. They wre legit feedback that Phil decided to ignore
[2017-03-02 00:57:20 UTC] tedicoz: HELP ME BUY SHIPS
[2017-03-02 00:57:26 UTC] kinggoken: his last month??
[2017-03-02 00:57:30 UTC] geoffdaniels: He might not make it to May.
[2017-03-02 00:57:32 UTC] tedicoz: 10k GOAL
[2017-03-02 00:57:35 UTC] hikerout89: notbeawesomeone wrong
[2017-03-02 00:57:51 UTC] hikerout89: phil has reached out more than any other streamer I know
[2017-03-02 00:57:55 UTC] startingfromscratch: For $15k you can name the ship
[2017-03-02 00:57:57 UTC] notbeawesomeone: bullshit
[2017-03-02 00:57:59 UTC] sonsofkojima1: if phil IRL streams i'd donate
[2017-03-02 00:58:02 UTC] sonsofkojima1: did*
[2017-03-02 00:58:08 UTC] goldencolts: @hikerout89 lmao
[2017-03-02 00:58:09 UTC] majestic_seven: @hikerout89 stop lying

[2017-03-02 00:58:09 UTC] loryuo: i mean
[2017-03-02 00:58:19 UTC] capstonegaming: i wanna see phil with other ppl hes always alone
[2017-03-02 00:58:20 UTC] loryuo: i know many streamers that reach out
[2017-03-02 00:58:28 UTC] hikerout89: see, now I'm getting abuse from everyone
[2017-03-02 00:58:30 UTC] tedicoz: maybe he should play XCOM 2
[2017-03-02 00:58:32 UTC] geoffdaniels: I kinda don't want him touching NieR:Automata.
[2017-03-02 00:58:33 UTC] loryuo: what
[2017-03-02 00:58:37 UTC] loryuo: this isn't abuse
[2017-03-02 00:58:40 UTC] tedicoz: PLAY XCOM 2
[2017-03-02 00:58:43 UTC] loryuo: stop being thin blooded
[2017-03-02 00:58:47 UTC] hikerout89: its bullying
[2017-03-02 00:58:58 UTC] loryuo: lol
[2017-03-02 00:58:59 UTC] indahood21: Nier is a kids game its easy
[2017-03-02 00:59:02 UTC] misterlightningbolt: Does Phil ever host other streamers when he is done? If they did it in return for him he could get alot of new eyes on his twitch
[2017-03-02 00:59:10 UTC] geoffdaniels: I know, but 2Bae.
[2017-03-02 00:59:10 UTC] notbeawesomeone: hikerout89 That's not an abuse. That's just criticism.
[2017-03-02 00:59:13 UTC] codenameone: What's so special about their Nier game?
[2017-03-02 00:59:17 UTC] tedicoz: @indahood21 but its got 2b booty though
[2017-03-02 00:59:20 UTC] capstonegaming: no he doesnt host other people on twitch
[2017-03-02 00:59:22 UTC] thecrow121684: typical he can say youre wrong but say hes wrong and youre bullying him
[2017-03-02 00:59:23 UTC] codenameone: *this Nier game.
[2017-03-02 00:59:24 UTC] tophersandwich: Now I know I made the right choice in watching this instead of doing my paper
[2017-03-02 00:59:30 UTC] kinggoken: lol
[2017-03-02 00:59:35 UTC] tedicoz: it's got some girl with a butt
[2017-03-02 00:59:37 UTC] toblo1: Yoko Taro games just have a following, thats all
[2017-03-02 00:59:38 UTC] 3domshet: main problem is that he only "interacts" with the chat WHEN HE NEEDS HELP. This makes his already borin gameplay... more boring
[2017-03-02 00:59:39 UTC] kinggoken: i actually need to be working on a paper as well
[2017-03-02 00:59:45 UTC] kinggoken: got sucked into this
[2017-03-02 00:59:54 UTC] geoffdaniels: @CodenameOne It looks and plays really really fun.
[2017-03-02 00:59:58 UTC] goldencolts: >they fell for the college meme
[2017-03-02 01:00:08 UTC] loryuo: i enjoy yoko taro's games
[2017-03-02 01:00:09 UTC] indahood21: @tedicoz horizon zero dawn red head got booty and tits tho
[2017-03-02 01:00:10 UTC] toblo1: Knowing Phil he'd just play one ending of Automata and just call it his "full playthrough"
[2017-03-02 01:00:10 UTC] tedicoz: he should play Blackwake
[2017-03-02 01:00:18 UTC] toblo1: Like how he did with DW8
[2017-03-02 01:00:33 UTC] loryuo: i'm glad he's not going to play it
[2017-03-02 01:00:36 UTC] tedicoz: @indahood21 you a ginger guy? I took you as a grey haired/ white haired guy
[2017-03-02 01:00:38 UTC] capstonegaming: He needs an open party on his game so we can hear all the randos or his entourage....basically phil needs a faction like in wrestling
[2017-03-02 01:00:57 UTC] loryuo: it's like when he jumped into drakengard 3 and got confused
[2017-03-02 01:01:06 UTC] hikerout89: honestly I would love if he could invite somebody round and have a back and fourth
[2017-03-02 01:01:08 UTC] indahood21: Ginger are kinda sexy but no one really like them u feel me lol
[2017-03-02 01:01:11 UTC] drilbit777: Nier Automata has 26 endings tho lol
[2017-03-02 01:01:14 UTC] tedicoz: yeah
[2017-03-02 01:01:18 UTC] drilbit777: But most of them are joke endings btw
[2017-03-02 01:01:23 UTC] tedicoz: It takes a certain ginger
[2017-03-02 01:01:34 UTC] loryuo: dang it drillbit
[2017-03-02 01:01:42 UTC] loryuo: i didn't want to know haha
[2017-03-02 01:01:53 UTC] majestic_seven: @hikerout89 that might legit be something watchable from him
[2017-03-02 01:02:11 UTC] indahood21: @Tedicoz i live in the hood so all i see is ghetto black woman
[2017-03-02 01:02:17 UTC] tedicoz: ahhh I see
[2017-03-02 01:02:31 UTC] indahood21: Hard to find a ginger round here fam

[2017-03-02 01:03:48 UTC] tedicoz: yeah
[2017-03-02 01:04:04 UTC] mynameismrrobot: Is phil going to view quit Horizon?
[2017-03-02 01:04:09 UTC] tedicoz: @majestic_seven what did you mean by this @hikerout89 that might legit be something watchable from him
[2017-03-02 01:04:17 UTC] indahood21: Dont hate on Horizon Ginger Dawn
[2017-03-02 01:04:17 UTC] tedicoz: what might be watchable
[2017-03-02 01:04:27 UTC] loryuo: might just rush through it so it's over and done with
[2017-03-02 01:04:53 UTC] hikerout89: if he does co-commentary, maybe with leanna could be cool
[2017-03-02 01:05:03 UTC] majestic_seven: @tedicoz Dsp actually letting ppl debate with him with no censorship
[2017-03-02 01:05:03 UTC] mynameismrrobot: He should just quit it
[2017-03-02 01:05:07 UTC] loryuo: he should just stick to what he likes
[2017-03-02 01:05:13 UTC] loryuo: instead of trying to play every new release
[2017-03-02 01:05:30 UTC] indahood21: Btw mass effect adromeda going have full naked sex scenes u welcome phil
[2017-03-02 01:05:41 UTC] tedicoz: dsp should do a politics channel
[2017-03-02 01:05:51 UTC] loryuo: are you sure about that
[2017-03-02 01:05:54 UTC] loryuo: lol
[2017-03-02 01:05:56 UTC] tedicoz: THE GLOBALISTS
[2017-03-02 01:05:57 UTC] tophersandwich: We need more Cooking with the King.
[2017-03-02 01:06:04 UTC] rooksyrok: Politics will divide his fanbase, terrible idea.
[2017-03-02 01:06:07 UTC] tedicoz: THEY ARE POISIONING OUR WATER
[2017-03-02 01:06:12 UTC] mynameismrrobot: @indahood21 Eh not with those faces
[2017-03-02 01:06:23 UTC] hikerout89: actually phil is spot on with his politics so that could be fun and insightful
[2017-03-02 01:06:23 UTC] tedicoz: AHHHHHHHH WE ARE BREAKING THE CONDITIONING

[2017-03-02 01:06:53 UTC] hikerout89: alex jones is crazy though
[2017-03-02 01:07:04 UTC] loryuo: whats your point
[2017-03-02 01:07:06 UTC] indahood21: @DarkSydePhil mass effect adromeda going have full naked sex scenes that will bring in the views
[2017-03-02 01:07:06 UTC] tophersandwich: Alex Jones puts in effort. Phil doesn't
[2017-03-02 01:07:17 UTC] majestic_seven: If he makes a politics channel it'll be doa no doubt
[2017-03-02 01:07:21 UTC] tedicoz: well imagine phil in a suit
[2017-03-02 01:07:30 UTC] tedicoz: can u
[2017-03-02 01:07:34 UTC] startingfromscratch: He needs to just do a bunch of legitimate drunk streams
[2017-03-02 01:07:42 UTC] tedicoz: then imagine him with alex jones hair boom
[2017-03-02 01:07:45 UTC] jezjez321: c
[2017-03-02 01:08:10 UTC] mynameismrrobot: Phil should fix his relationship with Howard and John
[2017-03-02 01:08:19 UTC] majestic_seven: Well the real him will come out when he's drunk
[2017-03-02 01:08:20 UTC] hikerout89: he has already tried
[2017-03-02 01:08:29 UTC] hikerout89: john and Rambo are the problem
[2017-03-02 01:08:41 UTC] tedicoz: he should do a drunk marathon patreon goal my /v/ros
[2017-03-02 01:08:51 UTC] startingfromscratch: Exactly - then you get his "real review" that he could use for the actual review videos
[2017-03-02 01:09:02 UTC] majestic_seven: @hikerout89 not even lmao
[2017-03-02 01:09:18 UTC] kingjhags023: youre wrong hike
[2017-03-02 01:09:24 UTC] startingfromscratch: Real drunk reactions are the best ranking system.
[2017-03-02 01:09:29 UTC] hikerout89: majestic_seven he has talked about this, once again he reached out, abusive video in return from john
[2017-03-02 01:09:33 UTC] indahood21: Its this guy called salttiergod he is ridiculous he is insane
[2017-03-02 01:09:48 UTC] tedicoz: what do john and howard gain by lying?
[2017-03-02 01:09:56 UTC] mynameismrrobot: Wasn't Phil keeping all the money from John Howard and RTP?

[2017-03-02 18:56:02 UTC] yacherdy: Even HappyConsoleGamer says its his favorite Zelda of all time...and his favorite was the original Zelda from when he was a child.

[2017-03-02 19:05:15 UTC] deltaforce355: it depends on how many views you get jimbob
[2017-03-02 19:05:16 UTC] jojojingo122: Turning his videos back to 10 min long will be a god damn disaster

[2017-03-02 19:42:51 UTC] deathmachine23e: Cant wait to see how many dislikes the hateful truth will have on this game
[2017-03-02 19:42:52 UTC] capstonegaming: that was a threat!
[2017-03-02 19:42:53 UTC] capstonegaming: Xd
[2017-03-02 19:43:02 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Gino vs Shane for WM
[2017-03-02 19:43:04 UTC] yacherdy: Gino has spent enough time at the doctors tbh
[2017-03-02 19:43:06 UTC] aglet57: @hapticbabyman You never can tell sometimes. That's for sure.

[2017-03-02 19:43:48 UTC] where_is_zog: I wasn't trying to troll at all. I was referring to the amount of videos he already puts out. Lol
[2017-03-02 19:43:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: true neon there are rumours he and Guardiola have had words but that's probably just newspaper talk

[2017-03-02 19:45:16 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: I honestly want Aguero to prove he's better than Higua√≠n at club lvl so that he's picked over Higua√≠n in copa America and world cup. I want Argentina so badly to win for Messi

[2017-03-02 19:46:02 UTC] dukaduka: @neobornbloodmoonspartan9, Argentina lost so much that Messi decided to retire from it lol
[2017-03-02 19:46:04 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Doesn't Aguero get shifted to the wing for the national team to accommodate Higuain ?
[2017-03-02 19:46:14 UTC] blue_blur64: Small youtubers also got it early
[2017-03-02 19:46:22 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: how?

[2017-03-02 19:47:12 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Messi retired yeah, but it was because fans and his national executives didn't appreciate him, and the national team was having money stolen from them or so I heard.
[2017-03-02 19:47:19 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: he's back now.

[2017-03-02 19:50:43 UTC] darksydephil: DeltaForce355 you may be retarded, as we've discussed many times people dont watch twitch streams for the games, but the streamers. im sure the people geting 3k views aren't just playing the game like i do
[2017-03-02 19:50:46 UTC] betheboom: bobbi dont be mean
[2017-03-02 19:51:08 UTC] deltaforce355: thanks for calling me a retarded

[2017-03-02 19:51:26 UTC] betheboom: phil exactly so dont be bashing the game its not the games fault
[2017-03-02 19:51:29 UTC] ginosaji48: welcome to the family Delta
[2017-03-02 19:51:32 UTC] yacherdy: delta is not retarded :(
[2017-03-02 19:51:33 UTC] oznolasenyah91: So its not the game its the streamer???
[2017-03-02 19:51:36 UTC] darksydephil: delta, you say dumb shit like this every day
[2017-03-02 19:51:36 UTC] aglet57: Woah

[2017-03-02 19:51:56 UTC] hapticbabyman: Yeah the game seems pretty legit

[2017-03-02 19:51:59 UTC] deltaforce355: ok phil
[2017-03-02 19:52:07 UTC] betheboom: well then
[2017-03-02 19:52:10 UTC] deltaforce355: whatever
[2017-03-02 19:52:12 UTC] hippostabber: maybe try what other streamer are doing to get those 3k viewers
[2017-03-02 19:52:16 UTC] betheboom: /me hugs delta
[2017-03-02 19:52:22 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: I like how society reverted to like 5000 years after the world ended

[2017-03-02 19:52:30 UTC] dukaduka: /me gives delta a high five
[2017-03-02 19:52:30 UTC] hapticbabyman: DSP I always kinda felt you underestimate retro games and how well they do for you.
[2017-03-02 19:52:32 UTC] deltaforce355: thanks guys :(
[2017-03-02 19:52:39 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: and bethe is a worse dumbass TriHard /
[2017-03-02 19:52:40 UTC] chocobotamer: DeltaForce355, danLove

[2017-03-02 19:52:41 UTC] masternutella: a high five lol
[2017-03-02 19:52:49 UTC] hapticbabyman: Like the Crash streams did very well w/ views compared to stuff like this, Nioh and other AAA games
[2017-03-02 19:52:58 UTC] splitplaythru: Yes you did
[2017-03-02 19:53:11 UTC] bobbi_ling: nioh had good views, near 1k
[2017-03-02 19:53:15 UTC] radicaldreamer1: damn delta
[2017-03-02 19:53:17 UTC] hapticbabyman: Same w/ Sonic '06 and even Scarface
[2017-03-02 19:53:18 UTC] tigerflamessssss: im just here to watch you Dead in this game
[2017-03-02 19:53:21 UTC] splitplaythru: Longlegs is a bird-like enemy you fought already
[2017-03-02 19:53:23 UTC] soulrider95: Bobbi_Ling, on the first day cuz he had Giveaway in the title LUL
[2017-03-02 19:53:24 UTC] radicaldreamer1: shots fired Kappa
[2017-03-02 19:53:29 UTC] oznolasenyah91: Clearly not enough raging
[2017-03-02 19:53:40 UTC] radicaldreamer1: true that giveaway was lit as fuck
[2017-03-02 19:53:42 UTC] deltaforce355: i mean. im here to see some rage
[2017-03-02 19:53:42 UTC] deathmachine23e: Why i got banned u didnt even say anything hateful lol
[2017-03-02 19:53:46 UTC] kushiyakitori: yeah. im guessing people show up more often when he rages
[2017-03-02 19:53:48 UTC] easton_taylor1: Umm who hype for Zelda?
[2017-03-02 19:53:49 UTC] deltaforce355: thats why im here
[2017-03-02 19:53:49 UTC] kharimane: it used to be albert einstein
[2017-03-02 19:53:53 UTC] deathmachine23e: *i
[2017-03-02 19:53:55 UTC] deltaforce355: and you guys too
[2017-03-02 19:53:56 UTC] radicaldreamer1: and a sub won the game Dansgame
[2017-03-02 19:53:57 UTC] chocobotamer: Zelda danGasm
[2017-03-02 19:54:04 UTC] dukaduka: well its basically a youtube format on twitch
[2017-03-02 19:54:08 UTC] dukaduka: this guys hair...
[2017-03-02 19:54:09 UTC] deltaforce355: you guys are fun to talk too :)
[2017-03-02 19:54:25 UTC] aglet57: right back at you @DeltaForce355
[2017-03-02 19:54:28 UTC] yacherdy: delta is my homie
[2017-03-02 19:54:29 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: I mean, this chat is pretty stupid sometimes lol
[2017-03-02 19:54:34 UTC] messenger2009: sidequests are getting better I think
[2017-03-02 19:54:34 UTC] dukaduka: @DeltaForce355, SeemsGood
[2017-03-02 19:54:38 UTC] hapticbabyman: I think people enjoy you playing retro games more than these AAA games b/c they're harder and b/c they have nostalgia, and it's fun seeing you play them. Plus they give you a rush in commentary modern AAA games don't provide since they're so easy.
[2017-03-02 19:54:45 UTC] neon_zedword: Man that new Zelda is getting crazyyy twitch views
[2017-03-02 19:54:46 UTC] crazed_connovore: the character models in this game look so strange
[2017-03-02 19:54:54 UTC] betheboom: bobbi being mean :(
[2017-03-02 19:55:01 UTC] betheboom: and now dragin is here
[2017-03-02 19:55:14 UTC] yacherdy: better hide bethe
[2017-03-02 19:55:22 UTC] betheboom: /me hides
[2017-03-02 19:55:22 UTC] deathmachine23e: Am im the only one who hate the camera angle on her? Can you zoom out?
[2017-03-02 19:55:32 UTC] dukaduka: @hapticbabyman, agree and disagree. all games lend to some commentary, but it depends on how the player approaches the game.
[2017-03-02 19:55:34 UTC] betheboom: yacherdy this is not gunna work
[2017-03-02 19:55:35 UTC] kushiyakitori: I kinda agreen hapticbabyman. There is also something to seeing Phil play older games and commentate on them after we have played them years ago with nostalgia
[2017-03-02 19:55:42 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Mexican dude with Texan accent and blonde hair SeemsGood
[2017-03-02 19:55:42 UTC] hapticbabyman: I bet if you switched out this game for, say, Ghouls n' Ghosts, GnG would draw in more people. Games like that bring out your best commentary imo
[2017-03-02 19:55:53 UTC] bobbi_ling: this game has the worst head wear ever
[2017-03-02 19:56:08 UTC] betheboom: :(
[2017-03-02 19:56:09 UTC] blue_blur64: ugh, my sinuses seem to be really fucked up. Everywhere around my nose feels tense D:
[2017-03-02 19:56:20 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: sorry blueblur
[2017-03-02 19:56:23 UTC] yacherdy: lol bethe
[2017-03-02 19:56:27 UTC] yacherdy: :(
[2017-03-02 19:56:30 UTC] bobbi_ling: need a doctor for sinus
[2017-03-02 19:56:37 UTC] kushiyakitori: Crash 3 would probably get some strong views like the other marathons. Would probably bring rage as well
[2017-03-02 19:56:42 UTC] hapticbabyman: @dukaduka yeah like w/ this game right now, he's doing the sidequests a lot. Some people probably want to see the main story missions
[2017-03-02 19:56:43 UTC] yacherdy: rush rush get the yeyo
[2017-03-02 19:57:05 UTC] betheboom: silent i can punch your nose that will help Kappa
[2017-03-02 19:57:09 UTC] kushiyakitori: southeast
[2017-03-02 19:57:17 UTC] blue_blur64: That will absolutely NOT help
[2017-03-02 19:57:20 UTC] dukaduka: @hapticbabyman, yup and its just the side quests are forgetable, so its harder to commentate on those
[2017-03-02 19:57:25 UTC] hapticbabyman: @KushiYakitori It definitely would. Which is why it's so weird that Danganronpa game won the poll; that game's not going to bring in a lot of views
[2017-03-02 19:57:30 UTC] deathmachine23e: The lip sync in this game is plain terrible
[2017-03-02 19:57:35 UTC] ginosaji48: /me punches bethe in the dick
[2017-03-02 19:57:47 UTC] bobbi_ling: ive seen worse lip sync
[2017-03-02 19:57:53 UTC] betheboom: OWWWWWWWWW
[2017-03-02 19:58:13 UTC] tigerflamessssss: i just want to watch you die over and over phil
[2017-03-02 19:58:20 UTC] kushiyakitori: @hapticbabyman, I voted for Jak 3 myself but I agree with you. Danganronpa is what the patrons want to see though. I don't think it will get as much twitch/YT views but its patron supported so it will be fine. Personally want to see the rage for Jak 3 and Crash 3
[2017-03-02 19:58:22 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: blueblur64 place a tbsp. of turmeric into a cup of water that's been boiling for 10 mins to have a 12 percent solution. it relieves inflammation. you can get turmeric from Walmart's Mcormick stock for 4 dollars. Its a spice with an earthy taste
[2017-03-02 19:58:25 UTC] hapticbabyman: And that remaster for it comes out next month too, so why did people vote for him to play the older version when the remaster is next month, but they act like him playing Crash 3 before the remaster would be "too soon"?
[2017-03-02 19:58:29 UTC] deathmachine23e: @bobbi_ling Examples? (Dont say dark souls)
[2017-03-02 19:58:30 UTC] dukaduka: @deathmachine23e, its pretty good in the cutscenes early on but in game and in those dialogue sections it isnt good
[2017-03-02 19:58:35 UTC] betheboom: hmmmmmm
[2017-03-02 19:58:36 UTC] diobrand00: damn only 200 viewers wtf happened?
[2017-03-02 19:58:41 UTC] chocobotamer: danHmm

Alex puts the game in another level, and we will be blessed if we ever see a player with his skill and passion for the game again. mang0 breaks records. Armada breaks records. Alex19 breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics. I prefer the magic.

[2017-03-02 20:35:44 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Drilbit777 It just means a lot of people who Meta decided to count towards the average gave it high scores. Not saying the game isn't good, but Metacritic is hardly the end-all be-all in saying what makes a good game vs. a bad one
[2017-03-02 20:35:53 UTC] betheboom: bobb i am
[2017-03-02 20:35:58 UTC] bobbi_ling: lol

[2017-03-02 20:36:14 UTC] yacherdy: user ratings on Metacritic are trash
[2017-03-02 20:36:18 UTC] neuroblack77: Why isn't he removing the components?
[2017-03-02 20:36:31 UTC] hapticbabyman: Also Meta is heavily biased towards modern games. And yes @YaCherdy , they generally are.
[2017-03-02 20:36:35 UTC] toshikenzo: have stack fire into them to proc heated core. like nioh you needed to stack elements
[2017-03-02 20:36:48 UTC] deltaforce355: if bobbi would be against bethe in tekken 7
[2017-03-02 20:36:54 UTC] deltaforce355: i wonder who will win

[2017-03-02 20:37:08 UTC] deltaforce355: i guess?
[2017-03-02 20:37:08 UTC] bobbi_ling: too easy
[2017-03-02 20:37:17 UTC] drilbit777: Plus alot of big review sites have been giving it 9 or 10s

[2017-03-02 20:37:58 UTC] neuroblack77: @MasterNutella Sometimes.
[2017-03-02 20:38:01 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Drilbit777 That still doesn't mean much. It's Zelda. I'm sure some of them feel obligated to give a high score or suffer bitching from hardcore Zelda fans.
[2017-03-02 20:38:14 UTC] betheboom: gino i agree with that because one reason I WOULD NOT HIT A GIRL
[2017-03-02 20:38:19 UTC] crazed_connovore: wow dude he dodged
[2017-03-02 20:38:22 UTC] ginosaji48: sure
[2017-03-02 20:38:29 UTC] deltaforce355: just pretend its a man bethe
[2017-03-02 20:38:31 UTC] hapticbabyman: It's like how a lot of spots gave Uncharted 4 super-high scores. That game's mediocre at best in single-player.
[2017-03-02 20:38:32 UTC] deltaforce355: problem solved
[2017-03-02 20:38:43 UTC] drilbit777: @hapticbabyman, Or it could be you know a good game?
[2017-03-02 20:38:48 UTC] hapticbabyman: But I'm sure BOTW is going to be a great game
[2017-03-02 20:38:58 UTC] masternutella: BOTW?
[2017-03-02 20:39:02 UTC] kushiyakitori: breath of the wild
[2017-03-02 20:39:03 UTC] alex_dragonul: @YaCherdy it can be fun yes , but it is pretty boring exp to watch with all of those side quests , i i agree with Phil and others that where the game really shine is in those aspects that i said and graphcs , characters and story
[2017-03-02 20:39:09 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Drilbit777 I know my way around video games, let's just leave it at that.
[2017-03-02 20:39:15 UTC] ginosaji48: thank god becky doesnt have face cam so we cant see those scars and shit

[2017-03-02 20:39:37 UTC] ginosaji48: yep
[2017-03-02 20:39:38 UTC] yacherdy: @alex_dragonul Yeah fair enough...I just personally enjoy as much side quests as I can get in a game. Think Skyrim or Fallout.
[2017-03-02 20:39:44 UTC] neuroblack77: @vsevolodeliseev Freeze is good too
[2017-03-02 20:39:47 UTC] royal_phalanx91: does bex look like aloy?
[2017-03-02 20:39:52 UTC] ohtaooig: phil is doing a bow only run?

[2017-03-02 20:40:19 UTC] neuroblack77: Yup, just like the spear only run from Nioh.
[2017-03-02 20:40:27 UTC] crazed_connovore: he is mid stance spearing it
[2017-03-02 20:40:30 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I noticed he's ignoring the bombs
[2017-03-02 20:40:33 UTC] yacherdy: Oi-rish OSsloth
[2017-03-02 20:40:38 UTC] crazed_connovore: haha
[2017-03-02 20:40:39 UTC] hapticbabyman: Like, a lot of reviewers have very specific preferences for the games they like, and tend to be very ignorant about games that fall outside of that preference. But they use that preference to objectively determine if some games are better than others. That's not how you're supposed to review games.
[2017-03-02 20:40:52 UTC] deathmachine23e: This game looks so boring
[2017-03-02 20:40:53 UTC] neuroblack77: Freeze is REALLY good for stacking damage. It helps against the Corruptors
[2017-03-02 20:40:59 UTC] yacherdy: Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others...
[2017-03-02 20:41:08 UTC] masternutella: oh god lol

[2017-03-02 20:41:15 UTC] bobbi_ling: beth quit nioh on the 1st real boss after breaking his controller. a game he paid full price for. then says hes a better gamer than phil. let that sink in
[2017-03-02 20:41:24 UTC] yacherdy: from the ice cage to the dole age..there is but one concern..some girls are bigger than others

Game Dev ofr this kind of games should look more at Witcher 3 with some of its side-content imo

[2017-03-02 20:59:24 UTC] gineriella: yo
[2017-03-02 20:59:28 UTC] encelor: watchout don't make bethe mad or he'll suicide bomb you
[2017-03-02 20:59:29 UTC] therealkingghidorah: he just strolled in "Wheres the food Cellar?" Kappa
[2017-03-02 20:59:30 UTC] hapticbabyman: If it's just the raw playthrough broken up into 10-minute vids, people will skip the vids where interesting stuff (either on the game's end or his end) isn't happening. That'd be worst than just skipping around in the longer videos
[2017-03-02 20:59:30 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :( betheboom I didn't mean it
[2017-03-02 20:59:30 UTC] gineriella: how goes it folks
[2017-03-02 20:59:33 UTC] cerulean86_: I am in fact the real one I don't know how i can prove that to you, phil banned my normal account for... reasons.
[2017-03-02 20:59:41 UTC] betheboom: jimbob you still said it
[2017-03-02 20:59:44 UTC] encelor: @gineriella good how are you?
[2017-03-02 20:59:47 UTC] gineriella: i just watch Phil's playthrough of super mario galaxy
[2017-03-02 20:59:50 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: if he edits videos, content would be lost, and content is money
[2017-03-02 20:59:51 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: you can discuss phils ad fiasco thing here https://thekingofhate.com/forums/topic/3205-feedback-to-ad-fiasco-update/?page=2#comment-79922

[2017-03-02 21:00:05 UTC] gineriella: lol Phil 'that fucking weapon"
[2017-03-02 21:00:16 UTC] coffeemode: i would post on forums vidar but people are extremely hostile if you say anything negative
[2017-03-02 21:00:17 UTC] gineriella: this game looks fun
[2017-03-02 21:00:22 UTC] hapticbabyman: And if he makes the change and it doesn't work, then goes back, won't that cause some people to question his level of consistency w/ video uploads?
[2017-03-02 21:00:25 UTC] betheboom: gines errr its a bow
[2017-03-02 21:00:26 UTC] therealkingghidorah: @slingzero why is it hard?
[2017-03-02 21:00:27 UTC] popsicolo: I just watch the streams live. If I want to support Phil, I just let the playlists run while I'm out doing something else.
[2017-03-02 21:00:31 UTC] betheboom: ohhh
[2017-03-02 21:00:37 UTC] betheboom: the gun
[2017-03-02 21:00:39 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: read the thread before you talk out of your ass coffemode

[2017-03-02 21:00:59 UTC] ohtaooig: @mr_vidar_viking talking like phil :o
[2017-03-02 21:00:59 UTC] cerulean86_: Is phil against doing what other twitch streamers do? Reply to chat and take live donations?
[2017-03-02 21:01:02 UTC] betheboom: this game is fun gines might not be as fun to watch though
[2017-03-02 21:01:02 UTC] dukaduka: @Popsicolo, cool. or you could donate to his patreon ;)
[2017-03-02 21:01:04 UTC] suomi2013: this game is 30 FPS fuck PS4 it fucking sucks ass
[2017-03-02 21:01:05 UTC] lvlpower: @DarksydePhil it's not like mass effect were you tell the ai to stay in place or to come with you
[2017-03-02 21:01:10 UTC] mrviews: i think philbertus "business" will die sooner or later.

[2017-03-02 21:01:21 UTC] betheboom: gines welcome to the chat we fight everyday
[2017-03-02 21:01:21 UTC] hapticbabyman: Fact is, I don't think raw gameplay videos as a whole work for YT anymore unless it's an actual stream. And streaming on Twitch is better anyway.
[2017-03-02 21:01:24 UTC] suomi2013: how the fuck this is nextgen and still 30 fps i m upset
[2017-03-02 21:01:24 UTC] slingzero: @TheRealKingGhidorah pretty challenging and im pretty good with this games combat
[2017-03-02 21:01:26 UTC] gineriella: haha
[2017-03-02 21:01:27 UTC] mrviews: u cant even call it a business if you live of donations
[2017-03-02 21:01:28 UTC] bobbi_ling: steve is bae, what more can i say. beth is bad, he makes you mad
[2017-03-02 21:01:29 UTC] cerulean86_: I really think live donations is a revenue stream DSP is missing out on
[2017-03-02 21:01:29 UTC] royal_phalanx91: phil is against editing
[2017-03-02 21:01:33 UTC] betheboom: gines if you play it you will have tons of fun

[2017-03-02 21:01:43 UTC] lvlpower: The ai have the mind of there own
[2017-03-02 21:01:44 UTC] gineriella: i'm taking a break from twitch tho
[2017-03-02 21:01:45 UTC] coffeemode: gameplay videos are fine, lots of youtubers do raw gameplay. but they keep it interesting or edit really boring things
[2017-03-02 21:01:47 UTC] ohtaooig: raw unedited gameplay = least effort possible
[2017-03-02 21:01:52 UTC] gineriella: going solely on youtube these days
[2017-03-02 21:02:00 UTC] gineriella: raw uncut footage ;)
[2017-03-02 21:02:01 UTC] yacherdy: thank the maker Kreygasm

[2017-03-02 21:02:03 UTC] therealkingghidorah: Praise the SUN!
[2017-03-02 21:02:03 UTC] dukaduka: @ohtaooig, also most gameplay possible
[2017-03-02 21:02:04 UTC] betheboom: bobbi but i built you a steve statue :(
[2017-03-02 21:02:09 UTC] suomi2013: damn this guy is ugly

[2017-03-02 21:02:31 UTC] ollyorange: hehe womens intuition
[2017-03-02 21:02:35 UTC] gineriella: tee hee
[2017-03-02 21:02:37 UTC] hapticbabyman: So he should do less videos AND make them shorter, edit out the dead air and keep the interesting stuff in. Theme the videos if he has to. That would give people less reason to skip a given video when they know ALL of them are worth something even if they're only 10 minutes each.
[2017-03-02 21:02:48 UTC] yacherdy: men listening to their wives? LOL
[2017-03-02 21:02:49 UTC] dukaduka: i remember when SSOPHKC would just label videos of him grinding, so you could skip them if you wanted :D
[2017-03-02 21:02:54 UTC] cerulean86_: I am as autistic as they come @mitlaufer
[2017-03-02 21:02:57 UTC] betheboom: i listen to my eife
[2017-03-02 21:02:59 UTC] betheboom: wife*
[2017-03-02 21:02:59 UTC] gineriella: if Phil edited his videos people wouldn't have to make TIHYDP vids lol
[2017-03-02 21:03:02 UTC] ollyorange: alloy knows best
[2017-03-02 21:03:07 UTC] betheboom: :D
[2017-03-02 21:03:08 UTC] royal_phalanx91: gineriella what's your youtube
[2017-03-02 21:03:08 UTC] popsicolo: That's not a bad idea dukaduka
[2017-03-02 21:03:10 UTC] coffeemode: i agree haptic, but the reason phil is doing this change is to abuse ad views
[2017-03-02 21:03:11 UTC] yacherdy: you sure bethe
[2017-03-02 21:03:17 UTC] coffeemode: so he doesnt want to shorten the content
[2017-03-02 21:03:19 UTC] gineriella: really @dukaduka? Seamus did that?
[2017-03-02 21:03:21 UTC] cerulean86_: I guess I was interested in seeing if even coming here would get me banned
[2017-03-02 21:03:21 UTC] betheboom: well not all the time
[2017-03-02 21:03:22 UTC] podusmonens: and she listens to me bethe
[2017-03-02 21:03:28 UTC] gineriella: @Royal_Phalanx91 it's "gines."
[2017-03-02 21:03:28 UTC] yacherdy: NotLikeThis
[2017-03-02 21:03:31 UTC] gineriella: :)
[2017-03-02 21:03:31 UTC] dukaduka: @hapticbabyman, boring gameplay sometimes has the best commentary :D
[2017-03-02 21:03:32 UTC] alukart177: Hey phil, what do you think about the new zelda getting perfect 10s all over the internet? ü§î
[2017-03-02 21:03:36 UTC] betheboom: seamus? ssohpkc?
[2017-03-02 21:03:41 UTC] dukaduka: @gineriella, yup for dark souls i think
[2017-03-02 21:03:42 UTC] hapticbabyman: But that could mean less YT profit, but if YT is already fucking him over, he should shift the bulk of his revenue to Twitch, Patreon, and paid sponsorships. YT and Machinima aren't cutting it seems like.
[2017-03-02 21:03:45 UTC] mrviews: i think most people watching philbert on youtube use adblack
[2017-03-02 21:03:48 UTC] mrviews: block

[2017-03-02 21:03:54 UTC] ollyorange: if nothing else the game world is stunning
[2017-03-02 21:03:58 UTC] coffeemode: most in general use adblock in youtube these days
[2017-03-02 21:04:00 UTC] cerulean86_: I mean if phil sees me I'm sure im insta ban but im not being rude or anything
[2017-03-02 21:04:03 UTC] coffeemode: but his living is still ads based
[2017-03-02 21:04:05 UTC] royal_phalanx91: should check your channel out, and I realized I could have gone to your channel page to find out, how silly of me :D
[2017-03-02 21:04:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: well bans are incoming if this condinue
[2017-03-02 21:04:12 UTC] gineriella: I want Phil to hang out with me
[2017-03-02 21:04:12 UTC] hapticbabyman: @dukaduka it does if he's having a hard time with the game ;0
[2017-03-02 21:04:12 UTC] dukaduka: adblack? TriHard sorry i couldnt resist
[2017-03-02 21:04:15 UTC] betheboom: i know seamus and phil know eachother

[2017-03-02 21:04:56 UTC] dukaduka: shotgun RAIN Kreygasm
[2017-03-02 21:04:59 UTC] cerulean86_: If what continues BSV? I know this is a sensative time for phil but what kind of things should I avoid talking about here
[2017-03-02 21:05:01 UTC] yacherdy: ol' dirty BASTARDS
[2017-03-02 21:05:03 UTC] gineriella: hahah i say shotgun rain because of him

[2017-03-02 22:35:49 UTC] neuroblack77: @hapticbabyman Yeah, everyone in SF now looks weird.
[2017-03-02 22:35:59 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Dahvid_87 Urien is OP in V tho. Not as much as Guile and (maybe) Balrog, but he's easily Top 5.
[2017-03-02 22:36:19 UTC] neuroblack77: @hapticbabyman According to a certain low tier deity, he is mid tier lol

[2017-03-02 22:36:54 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Neuroblack77 It's just *really* noticeable on Kolin. Like, Chun, Cammy, Mika etc. don't look weird in the face. It's mainly just Kolin and Ken.
[2017-03-02 22:36:57 UTC] deltaforce355: enjoy the ResidentSleeper stream guys

[2017-03-02 22:37:21 UTC] ifistyourgirl: I'd even rather this game over for honor...played once and never touched it since launch
[2017-03-02 22:37:26 UTC] hapticbabyman: And LTG has no idea what he's talking about, as usual. Has to come up w/ excuses for why he gets bodied w/ his main in mirrors
[2017-03-02 22:37:29 UTC] neuroblack77: Yeah you're right. Chun doesn't look Asian though and it bothers me. But I have bigger things to gripe about lol
[2017-03-02 22:37:41 UTC] dukaduka: Mai is all boobs too LUL
[2017-03-02 22:38:22 UTC] neuroblack77: @dukaduka You can especially see that in her DOA5 model.
[2017-03-02 22:38:46 UTC] neuroblack77: Urien will almost certainly get nerfed this month.
[2017-03-02 22:38:50 UTC] codenameone: LTG's a funny ass dude. Too bad he rages over the littlest shit and bans people for no reason.
[2017-03-02 22:39:00 UTC] dukaduka: Alex getting nerfed every other week lol
[2017-03-02 22:39:19 UTC] dahvid_87: ltg is a full retard, sucks in sfv so bad
[2017-03-02 22:39:24 UTC] dahvid_87: dsp would easy beat his ass
[2017-03-02 22:39:35 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Neuroblack77 Dunno; she actually has a kind of paler skin tone in V compared to IV. It could be they based her a bit more off Kreuk's face. Still best looking SFV girl imo; Laura, Cammy and Mika are close 2nds
[2017-03-02 22:39:38 UTC] neuroblack77: Yeah. LTG would actually be a great player if not for his attitude.
[2017-03-02 22:39:44 UTC] codenameone: I do believe they played once. I think DSP won? I can't remember.
[2017-03-02 22:40:01 UTC] ohtaooig: LTG remembers me someone, i cant remember who tho
[2017-03-02 22:40:20 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Dahvid_87 I'm not so sure about that. LTG talks a lot of shit and whatnot but his Urien is pretty decent, even if it's mostly 2nd-rate Nemo
[2017-03-02 22:40:30 UTC] ohtaooig: ltg is way better than phil
[2017-03-02 22:40:36 UTC] vkronosv: hack the robot
[2017-03-02 22:40:49 UTC] codenameone: Benned.
[2017-03-02 22:40:54 UTC] neuroblack77: @hapticbabyman Good taste lol. They made Chun thicker it seems too.
[2017-03-02 22:40:58 UTC] hapticbabyman: DSP hasn't played the game in ages and doesn't know the frame data; he'd most likely have a hard time against LTG in a set
[2017-03-02 22:41:00 UTC] ifistyourgirl: Deciding whether to blow $70 or wait for my $15 I get for spending $100 lol
[2017-03-02 22:41:04 UTC] kharimane: ah shit
[2017-03-02 22:41:08 UTC] kharimane: got an arrow in my eye
[2017-03-02 22:41:21 UTC] kharimane: maybe uh
[2017-03-02 22:41:22 UTC] ifistyourgirl: Tough choice with all this gameplay I watch
[2017-03-02 22:41:24 UTC] kharimane: maybe i can wipe it off

[2017-03-02 22:41:30 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Neuroblack77 Very, *very* appreciative of that. Thicc Chun is Best Chun ;)
[2017-03-02 22:41:46 UTC] neuroblack77: @hapticbabyman LTG's biggest weakness is that he can't take pressure. Once in the corner, he folds hard under throw mixups.
[2017-03-02 22:41:56 UTC] betheboom: /me DX CHOPS
[2017-03-02 22:41:58 UTC] smward87: that didn't stop Xiahou Dun bakc in 200ad. He just plucked that shit out and ate his eye so the enemy could claim no piece of him should he die. @kharimane
[2017-03-02 22:41:59 UTC] neuroblack77: Yes on Chun!
[2017-03-02 22:42:17 UTC] kharimane: thats intense
[2017-03-02 22:42:21 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Neuroblack77 Yep, notice that a lot. Did you see the Sonicsol set against him? He blew up his Urien w/ Nash.
[2017-03-02 22:42:31 UTC] kharimane: the question is
[2017-03-02 22:42:35 UTC] kharimane: did he swallow or chew
[2017-03-02 22:42:45 UTC] kharimane: that seperates the men from they boys
[2017-03-02 22:43:11 UTC] dukaduka: plasma cannon time Kreygasm
[2017-03-02 22:43:14 UTC] hapticbabyman: And almost any pro player breaks him in a corner. ISDD, Chris G, Gllty. And he can't tech throws worth shit.
[2017-03-02 22:43:20 UTC] smward87: lol indeed. he probably chewed. He was a beast
[2017-03-02 22:43:22 UTC] neuroblack77: I did see the set. It was funny to see him break down LTG's psychology during the set lol
[2017-03-02 22:43:56 UTC] kharimane: i gotta kill you -misses a point blank shot in a narrow corridor-
[2017-03-02 22:44:16 UTC] neuroblack77: @hapticbabyman He's afraid to tech, I think. If you miss a tech, you can eat huge damage off a crush counter. Although, he didn't tech in SF4 either though lol
[2017-03-02 22:44:28 UTC] vkronosv: LOL
[2017-03-02 22:44:28 UTC] neuroblack77: It was sad to see

[2017-03-02 22:45:53 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Neuroblack77 But then he complains about people throwing being "scrubs", and he immediately starts throwing himself. He's just not very good at tech'ing in general. He should be able to see shimmies on wakeup and know not to tech when someone does them.
[2017-03-02 22:45:56 UTC] doctorzzz: LUL earplugs

[2017-03-02 22:46:49 UTC] mdres2005: is PS4 only game
[2017-03-02 22:47:03 UTC] neuroblack77: @hapticbabyman Yeah, he's single-minded in that he whiffs TONS of normals (and calls it "footsies") and then essentially waits for V-Trig for Aegis setups
[2017-03-02 22:47:08 UTC] smward87: correct. sony funded and published it @mdres2005

[2017-03-02 22:47:31 UTC] neuroblack77: LTG is not bad but he could use some work

[2017-03-02 22:47:59 UTC] dahvid_87: well ltg lost to a smash player and also got perfected, his skills sucks so hard
[2017-03-02 22:48:00 UTC] neuroblack77: @ifistyourgirl The tutorial teaches you how to heal, use Focus, etc.
[2017-03-02 22:48:14 UTC] smward87: um...this is thousands of years in the future. no shit they don't have this technology today
[2017-03-02 22:48:15 UTC] dukaduka: awww sad moment BibleThump
[2017-03-02 22:48:42 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Dahvid_87 You do realize DSP hasn't touched the game in months, right? He doesn't know the frame data or matchups that have developed since he stopped playing. LTG is nowhere near the best but he at least kind of knows that stuff, w/ Urien no less. I can't see DSP winning a set against LTG in SFV unless LTG didn't bother to play.
[2017-03-02 22:48:43 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: Has Phil had a break yet?
[2017-03-02 22:48:43 UTC] neuroblack77: @Dahvid_87 True. His excuse was that it was early and that he wasn't serious. Plus, Anti used a shoto :p In any case, he did say, "no one who plays smash can beat me in a set."
[2017-03-02 22:48:44 UTC] smward87: the whole point is technology reached a peak then humanity was wiped out and sent back to the stoneage

[2017-03-02 22:50:28 UTC] dahvid_87: oh whos his best friend?
[2017-03-02 22:50:31 UTC] neuroblack77: I didn't have many problems with Nash pre-nerf besides his ambiguous dash animation. He got punished hard. Fang's poison needs a buff too. The S2 patch seemed random.

[2017-03-02 23:01:21 UTC] neuroblack77: @hapticbabyman I think Chun is reduced to a model at this point since she has the most costumes of all the characters.
[2017-03-02 23:01:28 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Dahvid_87 I will, but still: atm LTG is probably better than DSP in SFV, since he's been playing more (and played against better people than DSP has) and know the meta more. If DSP actually played again that maybe could change but we won't know unless he plays it.

[2017-03-02 23:02:14 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Neuroblack77 Yeah that could have something to do w/ it. But some of those costumes....lawd!
[2017-03-02 23:02:31 UTC] neuroblack77: Smug is a Balrog main though and he is safe on everything lol
[2017-03-02 23:02:49 UTC] dahvid_87: dsp never replies or?
[2017-03-02 23:02:53 UTC] doctorzzz: well smugger is good tho
[2017-03-02 23:02:56 UTC] neuroblack77: @hapticbabyman Bought digital because I wanted to see those thighs
[2017-03-02 23:03:41 UTC] fatmansthong: Dahvid chat is closed during gameplay so he can solely focus on that
[2017-03-02 23:03:43 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Neuroblack77: Hope you got the PC version then. I still need to pick it up sometime. Thank goodness for Youtube in the meantime ;)
[2017-03-02 23:03:47 UTC] neuroblack77: Smug is good, I'm not doubting that. Balrog is dominant in the meta too.
[2017-03-02 23:04:09 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Dahvid_87 DSP is...not very big on SFV, let's put it that way.
[2017-03-02 23:04:20 UTC] doctorzzz: well didnt he play diddles tho but now rog since he is not in V
[2017-03-02 23:04:33 UTC] dahvid_87: the fgc speak about him all the time tho on facebook groups
[2017-03-02 23:04:37 UTC] neuroblack77: @hapticbabyman PS4 because I have a potato PC :( I took a looong break because I got bored but I practice every now and then
[2017-03-02 23:04:45 UTC] dahvid_87: he eearned his respect when he won evo

[2017-03-02 23:04:59 UTC] fullcorn: is he gonna do unboxing nintendo switch today?
[2017-03-02 23:05:04 UTC] neuroblack77: @DoctorZzZ Yes. He played Karin at first though.

[2017-03-02 23:05:36 UTC] dahvid_87: if a player who plays everyday lose o smash and mortal kombat players, somethings wrong
[2017-03-02 23:05:50 UTC] faisalking11: yo
[2017-03-02 23:05:56 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Neuroblack77 FeelsBadMan. I don't think the game's super-optimized for PC, but as long as it's semi-modern it should do. When I get a better PC I'll pick the game up. Kind of waiting until maybe (hopefully) that System Shock remake comes out (hopefully this year) tho.

[2017-03-02 23:05:59 UTC] ohtaooig: @mr_vidar_viking well the chat was talking about ltg... i was just pointing out something

[2017-03-02 23:06:24 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: imagine how ltg and dsp feel being compared to each other
[2017-03-02 23:06:28 UTC] doctorzzz: Wrong bow my friend
[2017-03-02 23:06:31 UTC] doctorzzz: use sharp shooter
[2017-03-02 23:07:08 UTC] smward87: I doubt phil cares. he hasn't been a part of the FGC for years, and even then everyone hated him anyways @vsevolodeliseev
[2017-03-02 23:07:14 UTC] neuroblack77: @hapticbabyman You probably should wait. Besides, PC players have had problems with the game, as you mentioned like the infamous rootkit from a previous patch.
[2017-03-02 23:07:17 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Dahvid_87 Just b/c someone loses to Smash/MK players doesn't mean those players are bad. fwiw DSP's lost to people not even good at those games too, doesn't mean he's worst than them.
[2017-03-02 23:07:58 UTC] dahvid_87: getting perfected as wel, thats serious shit lol. thats why i believe dsp would beat ltgs ass
[2017-03-02 23:07:59 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: Has there been a break yet?
[2017-03-02 23:08:06 UTC] neuroblack77: Some Smash players play SF as well as some MK players. SonicFox had a good run with FANG for awhile as well as Ibuki.
[2017-03-02 23:08:12 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Neuroblack77 ah yeah I remember that disaster. wtf were they thinking with that. terrible drm-like idea from them.
[2017-03-02 23:08:12 UTC] doctorzzz: nope no break
[2017-03-02 23:08:30 UTC] doctorzzz: shoot the heat vents

[2017-03-02 23:09:36 UTC] dahvid_87: sonicfox play sfv at tournaments level compared to smash player antio
[2017-03-02 23:10:20 UTC] neuroblack77: @Dahvid_87 True. I was just pointing out that there is some crossover between fighting game communities.
[2017-03-02 23:10:31 UTC] dukaduka: AI deemed humans: "unnecessary" WutFace
[2017-03-02 23:10:31 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Neuroblack77 I'm sure Shoryuken did, too. It was completely ridiculous.
[2017-03-02 23:10:58 UTC] dahvid_87: the fgc wanna see dsp back, cant he do it for the community?
[2017-03-02 23:11:02 UTC] doctorzzz: wel i think sonicfoxx is like the best fgc player he can rek in every game
[2017-03-02 23:11:13 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Any important plot elements revealed/
[2017-03-02 23:11:42 UTC] dukaduka: @neobornbloodmoonspartan9, yeah i few
[2017-03-02 23:11:46 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Dahvid_87 thing is being good a fighter requires a LOT of time and investment, and it doesn't seem like DSP has either of those things in supply much these days.
[2017-03-02 23:11:49 UTC] smward87: not really a reveal, but the woman who may or may not be Aloy
[2017-03-02 23:11:57 UTC] neuroblack77: @DoctorZzZ I do want to see him play KOF or Tekken. I know he will dominate in Injustice 2.
[2017-03-02 23:12:10 UTC] smward87: 's mother has a modern name, aka the old ones
[2017-03-02 23:12:13 UTC] hapticbabyman: Plus the FGC scene is more crowded/competitive now vs. when he was in it. He could be intimidated by that tbh.
[2017-03-02 23:12:21 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: dukaduka like what, like where the robos came from or why they're there ?
[2017-03-02 23:12:26 UTC] smward87: so likely she is from the old world
[2017-03-02 23:12:55 UTC] hapticbabyman: He's playing Tekken 7 when that comes out. I'd actually like to see DSP try VF5 or 4 tho.
[2017-03-02 23:13:01 UTC] dukaduka: @neobornbloodmoonspartan9, more about the one viking looking guys sister being captured and this weird demon AI that the shadow carja worship
[2017-03-02 23:13:06 UTC] dahvid_87: ppl would also pay dsp to hit tournaments like some kind of sponsor to see him back in business
[2017-03-02 23:13:13 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: k
[2017-03-02 23:13:17 UTC] doctorzzz: what year is the game set in ? i know i saw logs from 2062 but that prolly past for that
