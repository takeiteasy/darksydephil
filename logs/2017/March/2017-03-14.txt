[2017-03-14 00:41:46 UTC] shiro_akiama: RIP
[2017-03-14 01:52:28 UTC] darksydephil: hello. anyone around?
[2017-03-14 01:52:32 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I am
[2017-03-14 01:52:43 UTC] mantasan: same
[2017-03-14 01:52:50 UTC] darksydephil: cool! Setting up the nier stream right now
[2017-03-14 01:52:58 UTC] kingjadvcmp: alrighty then
[2017-03-14 01:53:10 UTC] elipsion: I wish you would do at least 2 playthroughs of nier :(
[2017-03-14 01:53:20 UTC] elipsion: You are missing quite a bit by not doing so
[2017-03-14 01:53:21 UTC] darksydephil: also looks like the new partnership on DSPGaming is already working, got results for Saturday's views and looks to be on part with what it was w/machinima so
[2017-03-14 01:53:43 UTC] darksydephil: i was told the 2nd playthrough is almost identical to the first except it's a new charater, that it was the 3rd thats actually different
[2017-03-14 01:54:10 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I just wish the Nintendo bashing would stop, it comes across as a bit hypocritical. Phil has been very inflammatory in past to them. If Nintendo were aware of Phil they'd think he was just a hateful detractor lol
[2017-03-14 01:54:29 UTC] elipsion: Well theres some new cutscenes and side quests but it follows the general path of the first pt
[2017-03-14 01:55:09 UTC] darksydephil: Nintendo would probably feel that way, because they're a bunch of elitists and always have been.
[2017-03-14 01:55:19 UTC] darksydephil: they don't understand valid criticism.
[2017-03-14 01:55:25 UTC] darksydephil: just like their fanboys lol
[2017-03-14 01:56:14 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I am not a nintendo fanboy but there's very easy comparisons to make here. Let's say Nintendo discover you - think 'let us view his concerns'. They see you saying 'fuck you Nintendo', binning their console, calling them all sorts of crap. They'd think 'this guy is NOT a fan'.
[2017-03-14 01:57:06 UTC] darksydephil: that would be because they chose to watch a montage of the extreme things ive done instead of the tons of game playthroughs wher ei enjoye dtheir games. just like those who only watch hateful videos about me instead of the 40k+ positive ones
[2017-03-14 01:57:16 UTC] darksydephil: you have to show some actual intelligence to get the truth onthe internet sometimes
[2017-03-14 01:57:22 UTC] darksydephil: sadly, you can't force anyone to be smart
[2017-03-14 01:58:22 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I just think there's a bit of double-standards here, is all
[2017-03-14 01:59:35 UTC] warrock333: First!

[2017-03-14 02:05:35 UTC] chem_zegarra2018: Will Play all endings of Nier? Or will he finish after ending A?
[2017-03-14 02:05:42 UTC] supatune: just ending a
[2017-03-14 02:05:49 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I think Phil said he's only doing one ending, doesn't have time

[2017-03-14 02:08:25 UTC] encelor: from what i heard they did not want to expend phil's contract
[2017-03-14 02:08:29 UTC] god_revan_ryu: I've noticed that it's just random. Either Sat or Sun really. I mostly focus on the YT Vids because I can't be on streams most of the time @KingjadVCMP
[2017-03-14 02:08:38 UTC] thechraistx: he shoul do a Q n A

[2017-03-14 02:10:13 UTC] tourwithme: wtf the developers thinking making you play this game 3x
[2017-03-14 02:10:15 UTC] terraenigmata: third playthrough character may be spoiler
[2017-03-14 02:10:18 UTC] lvlpower: Kreygasm
[2017-03-14 02:10:20 UTC] vendatus: Maybe when theres downtime during Summer?
[2017-03-14 02:10:21 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil...if you cannot play the full game, does this mean you won't be doing a review? Would be a bit harsh to review it fully if you don't fully complete it, IMO. First impressions, general impressions, definitely fine
[2017-03-14 02:10:32 UTC] kekon3: Third character playthrough is a spoiler
[2017-03-14 02:10:33 UTC] slurmdrinker: That Mass Effect looks kinda crappy honestly
[2017-03-14 02:10:39 UTC] chem_zegarra2018: IGN STILL did a review.
[2017-03-14 02:10:41 UTC] stevotatersdeep: Can get mass effect early if you has ea access...
[2017-03-14 02:10:47 UTC] encelor: @DarksydePhil i don't think i can attend mass effect andormeda streams i am gonna nolkife it :D
[2017-03-14 02:10:52 UTC] supatune: any1 watch the tv show 'the expanse' i dont usually like sci fi shows but this is great, got me in the mood for mass effect
[2017-03-14 02:10:55 UTC] hiyawent: this mass effect is gonna be full of sjw retardation, calling it Keepo
[2017-03-14 02:10:56 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, i dont demand full coverage all 3 playthroughs, but is it possible for you to remote play the 2nd playthrough on the course of a few weeks WHEn you have time to kill
[2017-03-14 02:10:59 UTC] chem_zegarra2018: I'm pretty sure IGN didn't play all endings
[2017-03-14 02:11:07 UTC] god_revan_ryu: @Slurmdrinker because of PeeBee? lmfao
[2017-03-14 02:11:16 UTC] kingjadvcmp: IGN are farcical though

[2017-03-14 02:16:22 UTC] kingjadvcmp: aye YouTube has become commercialised, but you want in on that by getting ads on all of your content to capitalise on that commercialism!
[2017-03-14 02:16:25 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: At this point, you can only get big on Youtube if you talk politics, like Anthony Brian Logan did over the last year
[2017-03-14 02:16:27 UTC] focusdakid: I like some reaction videos. But it's the ones that jump on the bandwagon & do nothing all video that ruin it
[2017-03-14 02:16:29 UTC] alexharveyconrad: It is quite difficult... Competition has increased, especially since 2013.

[2017-03-14 02:17:17 UTC] encelor: @CapstoneGaming yacherdy and you
[2017-03-14 02:17:18 UTC] might_warlock: there are plenty of YT creators that push out content for a single game that do well... Destiny, WOW, LoL all get a good following

[2017-03-14 04:35:33 UTC] yacherdy: Phil you're doing that right? Kappa
[2017-03-14 04:35:34 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: Apparently the 3rd playthrough is TOTALLY different
[2017-03-14 04:35:35 UTC] montiblanc: almost all 26 of those endings are jokes kek

[2017-03-14 04:35:45 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: dood i shouldnt have to beat the game multiple times for best ending
[2017-03-14 04:35:46 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: That sounds pretty cool
[2017-03-14 04:35:47 UTC] kekon3: Only 5 of the endings are real endings, the rest of them are short bits and special game overs
[2017-03-14 04:35:47 UTC] howlingwolfjoey: Theres 5 endings, not 3.
[2017-03-14 04:35:48 UTC] tourwithme: cant believe they make you play it 3x for full story
[2017-03-14 04:35:49 UTC] montiblanc: like do a silly thing, get ending

[2017-03-14 04:35:58 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: OK, so
[2017-03-14 04:36:00 UTC] splitplaythru: 2nd PT is also different since you play with 9S.
[2017-03-14 04:36:06 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: the 2nd ending is playing as 9S
[2017-03-14 04:36:09 UTC] montiblanc: 9S most boring playthrough
[2017-03-14 04:36:13 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: 3rd ending is a complete different story
[2017-03-14 04:36:14 UTC] montiblanc: i wud youtube the rest
[2017-03-14 04:36:15 UTC] zeroisbestgirl: There's only 5 real endings

[2017-03-14 04:36:26 UTC] sanguinenite: Square enix tries it - being a lazy hack

[2017-03-14 04:37:24 UTC] yacherdy: 2016 had some bright spots but overall down from 2015
[2017-03-14 04:37:24 UTC] mujtaba12321: we'd like to see that ass again
[2017-03-14 04:37:25 UTC] iconicmaster1: Never going to play again
[2017-03-14 04:37:29 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, despite youtube views, we all loved this coverage in the stream
[2017-03-14 04:37:29 UTC] montiblanc: this is why i hate yoko trollo games, they shoul've combined route A & B
[2017-03-14 04:37:41 UTC] howlinthedeep: downtime is scarface though right? Kappa
[2017-03-14 04:37:41 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: "Yoko Trollo" lmao so true

[2017-03-14 04:38:40 UTC] terraenigmata: Dangan Ronpa is gonna be interesting
[2017-03-14 04:38:59 UTC] lightsidephillip: What do you mean by a day off?
[2017-03-14 04:39:00 UTC] winderfiend764: So is Danga Ronda like Ace attorney ?
[2017-03-14 04:39:00 UTC] zeroisbestgirl: PBS hasn't even been announced for the west yet

[2017-03-14 04:39:31 UTC] howlingwolfjoey: tbh, ME imo is overrated.
[2017-03-14 04:39:31 UTC] bammbino: chat -- would you like it if phil did an extended mid night run of mass effect for the COST of him cutting time on the following day's stream ?
[2017-03-14 04:39:34 UTC] howlinthedeep: Bye bye everyone

[2017-03-14 04:40:12 UTC] popsicolo: Alright. See you all around.
[2017-03-14 04:40:12 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: Apparently some guy named Liam streamed the entire Nier game

[2017-03-14 04:41:26 UTC] yacherdy: damn nier or nioh? tough one
[2017-03-14 04:41:45 UTC] darthvidarviking: flip a coin
[2017-03-14 04:41:47 UTC] bammbino: @Takoyaki93, japanese games drop in prices really quickly here in the us cause their budgets arent like gta 5
[2017-03-14 04:41:48 UTC] darthvidarviking: if it is that hard
[2017-03-14 04:42:03 UTC] bammbino: both are REALLY good in their own ways with both having cons
[2017-03-14 04:42:04 UTC] takoyaki93: @bammbino , i dont have a budget but im only allowed to buy 1 game.
[2017-03-14 04:42:11 UTC] bammbino: ohhh
[2017-03-14 04:42:17 UTC] bammbino: well damn lol
[2017-03-14 04:42:24 UTC] bammbino: so let me be blunt with you
[2017-03-14 04:42:32 UTC] bammbino: nioh - no replay value
[2017-03-14 04:42:33 UTC] yacherdy: If you want more challenge go with Nioh
[2017-03-14 04:42:56 UTC] bammbino: nier - insane replay value but the total time for 3 endings is less than getting platinum trophy for nioh
[2017-03-14 04:43:19 UTC] espn78: hello
[2017-03-14 04:43:27 UTC] bammbino: nier has a demo on psn, nioh doesnt
[2017-03-14 04:43:47 UTC] bammbino: if you manage to work with the camera changing shit on nier, i'd go with nier
[2017-03-14 04:44:00 UTC] bammbino: nioh doesnt offer much when you find the wep you like and beat the game
[2017-03-14 04:44:14 UTC] takoyaki93: @bammbino okay, decision made! thanks a bunch!!!
[2017-03-14 04:44:22 UTC] yacherdy: good tips bammbino

[2017-03-14 21:19:31 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: Well I have a question that I thought you would know for sure
[2017-03-14 21:19:57 UTC] darksydephil: ok?
[2017-03-14 21:20:01 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: if a youtube channel gets 3 dmca claims, will that still lead to a ban of the channel, like what happened to you years ago?
[2017-03-14 21:20:13 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: or has that changed
[2017-03-14 21:20:56 UTC] darksydephil: yes, well, it's 3 copyright strikes that lead to the channel being suspended. if any of those strikes get cleared, the suspension is lifted
[2017-03-14 21:21:07 UTC] darksydephil: but if they dont get cleared, it basically locks the channel until they are
[2017-03-14 21:21:17 UTC] darksydephil: if you get more than 3 strikes, you're pretty fucked
[2017-03-14 21:21:21 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: ok, thanks
[2017-03-14 21:21:29 UTC] darksydephil: np
