[2017-03-18 18:10:58 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, i think EA has fucked bioware over and forced a ME:A release, you're gonna hammer the game lol
[2017-03-18 18:10:59 UTC] dagowhopper: hi phil
[2017-03-18 18:11:04 UTC] yacherdy: Nationals are in Washington D.C.

[2017-03-18 18:11:41 UTC] darksydephil: crafty: neither really lol
[2017-03-18 18:11:48 UTC] betheboom: if mass effect is bad i dont care right now, i have not played it because it is not even OFFICIALLY released yet here soooo i can judge for myself WHEN it comes out
[2017-03-18 18:11:49 UTC] ryanbibisi033: i dont understand the problem with the new mass effect. the facial animations are fucky but theyve always been hilarious in those games. the story looks really good and the gameplay looks strong. i think its going to be received nicely
[2017-03-18 18:11:51 UTC] darksydephil: ok cool, i shall tweet that we're live
[2017-03-18 18:11:57 UTC] derichloveslemur: phil can't wait for the continuation

[2017-03-18 18:13:46 UTC] yacherdy: No use in bashing Mass Effect Andromeda before I even play it.
[2017-03-18 18:13:48 UTC] podusmonens: did you stream rocket league cherd?

[2017-03-18 18:14:20 UTC] beanie5181: Good afternoon guys
[2017-03-18 18:14:21 UTC] derichloveslemur: @craftymaniak89 can we talk in whispers?
[2017-03-18 18:14:27 UTC] jackwhite2000: when i play football with my friends i always get put in the gate
[2017-03-18 18:14:35 UTC] bammbino: @YaCherdy, its not really a bandwagon when its up on EA early access for us >.>

[2017-03-18 20:16:58 UTC] thecatmaster: @jackwhite2000 ok 3 and unity were bad I will admit. Even though they were not perfect I loved 1 and 2, and black flag in the series, and i hear Rogue was pretty good

[2017-03-18 20:26:29 UTC] anondublo1: that it does
[2017-03-18 20:26:37 UTC] mxtt10589: shoot it with an arrow
[2017-03-18 20:26:42 UTC] darthvidarviking: rotating 4 times just spins it in the same direction no?
[2017-03-18 20:26:44 UTC] vendatus: just magnet the chest Kappa
[2017-03-18 20:26:45 UTC] jackwhite2000: @TheCatMaster but p2p connections and 30fps ruin it imo
[2017-03-18 20:26:46 UTC] retrothicc2b: this game also has a lot of similar repetitiveness, but the open world does add something more incentive to the overall game experience.
[2017-03-18 20:26:53 UTC] howlinthedeep: yes jackwhite
[2017-03-18 20:26:57 UTC] howlinthedeep: i think he meant 3
[2017-03-18 20:27:11 UTC] soulofeden: @darksydephil are you going to cover mass effect? Haven't heard many good things about it
[2017-03-18 20:27:18 UTC] shega_ace: @Vendatus you can't magnet most of these chests in the shrines they are designed so that you have to get it a legit way
[2017-03-18 20:27:21 UTC] encelor: thunder thunder thunder CATS!
[2017-03-18 20:27:21 UTC] thecatmaster: @jackwhite2000 it truly is, and I understand why it is more fun playing with people. I think Ubisoft may have a diamon in the rough with this game
[2017-03-18 20:27:23 UTC] howlinthedeep: p2p connections aren't the best
[2017-03-18 20:27:30 UTC] anondublo1: I don't know, I prefer well detailed areas vs empty spaces with nothing but junk loot to pick up
[2017-03-18 20:27:33 UTC] derichloveslemur: are there any positives you like about breath of the wild?
[2017-03-18 20:27:36 UTC] eternia_forever: hooooooooooooooooooooo @encelor
[2017-03-18 20:27:53 UTC] beanie5181: @encelor snaaarff
[2017-03-18 20:27:54 UTC] eternia_forever: very true phil
[2017-03-18 20:27:56 UTC] anondublo1: i don't like walking simulators with flower collecting, shit is boring to me
[2017-03-18 20:28:02 UTC] encelor: @Beanie5181 no not the snarfs
[2017-03-18 20:28:03 UTC] jackwhite2000: @TheCatMaster if the game wound have p2p and 30fps it would be one of the best games this generation
[2017-03-18 20:28:04 UTC] encelor: pls mercy
[2017-03-18 20:28:07 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Zapdos, moltres, and articuno swords. typical Nintendo MingLee
[2017-03-18 20:28:10 UTC] retrothicc2b: and delicious brown gerudo babes also.. add a bit more incentive.. Kreygasm
[2017-03-18 20:28:11 UTC] ratchefan12: @DarksydePhil you enjoying the game phil?
[2017-03-18 20:28:15 UTC] availableusername888: @anondublo1 yeah and this game looks like it got lots of those empty spaces, to make it look bigger than it is
[2017-03-18 20:28:16 UTC] mxtt10589: that was where you found the ball origianlly
[2017-03-18 20:28:28 UTC] mxtt10589: no you don't
[2017-03-18 20:28:35 UTC] megamannt125: I'm a minority in that I actually like the durability because it forces you to use different weapons, if it wasn't there I would've just used the same amazing weapon through the whole game
[2017-03-18 20:28:37 UTC] mfd4419: Balls
[2017-03-18 20:28:44 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil nice work btw

[2017-03-18 20:29:00 UTC] fatalbacura: jk
[2017-03-18 20:29:05 UTC] saintanti: @Darksydephil, isnt that kind of a silly thing to say? thats like saying "if a shooting game didn't have shooting it wouldn't be nearly as good of a game as it is"
[2017-03-18 20:29:05 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @megamannt125 SeemsGood good insigh
[2017-03-18 20:29:06 UTC] howlinthedeep: If Phil didn't like this game he would skip all these shrines
[2017-03-18 20:29:11 UTC] eternia_forever: yeah my balls need to get out there to #FemalesBeLooking
[2017-03-18 20:29:13 UTC] thecatmaster: @jackwhite2000 completely agree! Who knows, if there is a sequel we will get p2p and a better frame rate plus other needed things
[2017-03-18 20:29:13 UTC] saintanti: Breath of the wild was designed to be an exploration game.
[2017-03-18 20:29:24 UTC] supatune: the game is definitely not deserving of it's metacritic rating, but then zelda's always been a critic darling
[2017-03-18 20:29:26 UTC] retrothicc2b: AtlusCEO! Woo!
[2017-03-18 20:29:34 UTC] howlinthedeep: Nyx lol
[2017-03-18 20:29:37 UTC] encelor: @Megamannt125 if it was like fallout 3's durability would have been better 6 hits then break is kind of anoying :P
[2017-03-18 20:29:37 UTC] supatune: it's a very good game but best of all time tier? lel
[2017-03-18 20:29:37 UTC] thecatmaster: @jackwhite2000 are you going to buy the Kingdom Hearts Remaster?
[2017-03-18 20:29:38 UTC] eternia_forever: tip hype

[2017-03-18 20:29:49 UTC] jackwhite2000: @TheCatMaster if we get a sequel all i want is no p2p and 60fps
[2017-03-18 20:29:59 UTC] jackwhite2000: @TheCatMaster nahh
[2017-03-18 20:30:09 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Hope you enjoy Tekken 7 the cast is super awesome
[2017-03-18 20:30:10 UTC] sanguinenite: You dont want another persona 3
[2017-03-18 20:30:11 UTC] mxtt10589: @DarksydePhil apparently the master sword can shoot beams while at full health, can you test that out?
[2017-03-18 20:30:14 UTC] megamannt125: @encelor early game weapons maybe but endgame I hardly even had any weapons break except for combat trials and lynels
[2017-03-18 20:30:24 UTC] jackwhite2000: @TheCatMaster right now im still playing nioh horizon and ghost recon wildlands
[2017-03-18 20:30:27 UTC] mfd4419: Me two
[2017-03-18 20:30:34 UTC] supatune: i've heard it's challenging but not overly so

[2017-03-18 20:30:48 UTC] betheboom: better just play it on easy then
[2017-03-18 20:30:52 UTC] thecatmaster: @jackwhite2000 those two things would be great, but I'd also like a reason to return to the campaign and have at least ten maps
[2017-03-18 20:30:53 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @Darksydephil can you call your horse
