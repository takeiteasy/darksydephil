[2017-03-10 18:55:30 UTC] yacherdy: bethe :(
[2017-03-10 18:55:40 UTC] yacherdy: I felt the same way when I went to Hawaii for a week
[2017-03-10 18:55:45 UTC] poorlymade: Is is a relief Phil?
[2017-03-10 18:55:47 UTC] darksydephil: okay so yeah, there's nothing more to do on my part here. The new company has to do stuff internally and then DSPGaming will be with them. so just gotta wait on them. luckily this happened earlier in the day
[2017-03-10 18:55:48 UTC] capstonegaming: Machinima dieded
[2017-03-10 18:56:13 UTC] darksydephil: HOPEFULLY it processes today. would suck to have an entire weekend without monetization
[2017-03-10 18:56:13 UTC] betheboom: ok good bnews phil
[2017-03-10 18:56:21 UTC] poorlymade: Does it feel like a weight lifting to get rid of Machinima finally?
[2017-03-10 18:56:38 UTC] darksydephil: well, yes and no
[2017-03-10 18:57:02 UTC] darksydephil: for a while i had a great relationship with them and made a lot of money. it's too bad they changed so much for the worse and never recovered
[2017-03-10 18:57:17 UTC] poorlymade: Well now you're free to talk about what happened like you wanted to. You said it was killing you to have to keep it inside.
[2017-03-10 18:57:20 UTC] poorlymade: New vlog soon?
[2017-03-10 18:57:22 UTC] capstonegaming: youtube going that way too
[2017-03-10 18:57:26 UTC] darksydephil: no i'm not
[2017-03-10 18:57:34 UTC] darksydephil: i still have 2 other channels partnered with them lol
[2017-03-10 18:57:39 UTC] poorlymade: Oh
[2017-03-10 18:57:40 UTC] darksydephil: have to wait for those to expire. KOGaming doesn't until early april
[2017-03-10 18:57:48 UTC] poorlymade: Damn that sucks
[2017-03-10 18:58:02 UTC] poorlymade: KOHVlogs too?
[2017-03-10 18:58:11 UTC] darksydephil: yup but thats only for a few more days
[2017-03-10 18:58:17 UTC] poorlymade: Alright
[2017-03-10 18:58:28 UTC] darksydephil: that channel honestly does not need to be in any partnership program, its just talking to a camera. totally safe for copyright
[2017-03-10 18:58:29 UTC] retrothicc2b: dspCowboy
[2017-03-10 18:58:41 UTC] sensoji: When will you tell us the name of your new MCN?
[2017-03-10 18:59:03 UTC] retrothicc2b: Bawls energy drink AMPTropPunch
[2017-03-10 18:59:04 UTC] poorlymade: Does a non managed partnership protect you from copyright and content ID?
[2017-03-10 18:59:16 UTC] yacherdy: I drank some Bawls earlier
[2017-03-10 18:59:22 UTC] darksydephil: to some extent PoorlyMade
[2017-03-10 18:59:30 UTC] darksydephil: you get assistance with copyright issues etc
[2017-03-10 18:59:42 UTC] poorlymade: That's good!
[2017-03-10 18:59:52 UTC] darksydephil: content ID is iffy, it all depends on whose actually claiming it etc
[2017-03-10 19:00:01 UTC] poorlymade: Yeah I would assume so
[2017-03-10 19:00:02 UTC] darksydephil: ive heard that most content ID matches now get cleared up for the most part
[2017-03-10 19:00:12 UTC] darksydephil: since YouTube changed last year that is
[2017-03-10 19:00:34 UTC] darksydephil: honestly the reason im partnering DSPGaming with someone is in the hopes that in a bit i can upgrade to a managed partnership
[2017-03-10 19:00:40 UTC] poorlymade: Are you going to be a big fish in a small pond now?
[2017-03-10 19:00:55 UTC] darksydephil: i dont think id be a big fish anywhere, lol
[2017-03-10 19:01:05 UTC] poorlymade: 2 million views is a lot
[2017-03-10 19:01:12 UTC] poorlymade: a month
[2017-03-10 19:01:24 UTC] duderito2: Phil, PoorlyMade is a fredfuchs alt account the idiot in one of his recent vids was logged in on that alt account that's why he's so keen...
[2017-03-10 19:01:26 UTC] pokemon3323455: hey guys
[2017-03-10 19:01:27 UTC] jwalker70: I think it would make more sense to monitize yourself
[2017-03-10 19:01:40 UTC] laundryfiend: hi all
[2017-03-10 19:01:47 UTC] poorlymade: Who?
[2017-03-10 19:02:04 UTC] jwalker70: All a partnership would do is take a cut
[2017-03-10 19:02:13 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey laundryfiend
[2017-03-10 19:02:13 UTC] poorlymade: Yeah, sit back and collect
[2017-03-10 19:02:19 UTC] laundryfiend: Hi @theycallmejimbob
[2017-03-10 19:02:21 UTC] poorlymade: That's why they are kinda shady
[2017-03-10 19:02:21 UTC] yacherdy: Roy's keen oh, Roy's keen
[2017-03-10 19:02:22 UTC] laundryfiend: hope all is well
[2017-03-10 19:02:42 UTC] yacherdy: Morning's watch. All's well.
[2017-03-10 19:02:46 UTC] laundryfiend: MCN's are uselss these days. I've had content ID claims on my own vids and fought them successfully without an MCN
[2017-03-10 19:02:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: good thanks and yourself laundryfiend
[2017-03-10 19:02:52 UTC] laundryfiend: all they do is take a ct of your money
[2017-03-10 19:03:03 UTC] theycallmejimbob: good to hear YaCherdy
[2017-03-10 19:03:03 UTC] laundryfiend: I'm well @theycallmejimbob :)
[2017-03-10 19:03:04 UTC] darksydephil: self monetization is INCREDIBLY risky. especially for someone like me. tons of ways to fuck the system up and youtube doesn't have it. just look at what happened with THEKINGOFHATEHD in 2010. same shit can happen now
[2017-03-10 19:03:06 UTC] howlinthedeep: hi laundryfiend
[2017-03-10 19:03:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey deep
[2017-03-10 19:03:29 UTC] laundryfiend: @DarksydePhil I've done it for 3 years on gaming footage and never had a problem.

[2017-03-10 19:03:44 UTC] betheboom: hey deep
[2017-03-10 19:03:47 UTC] darksydephil: at least with a partner network you've got some clout and protection. it'd be one thing if i had a channel that was just starting, but an already established channel w/o a partner network, especially one doing gameplay, is a big risk
[2017-03-10 19:03:48 UTC] howlinthedeep: Hi bethe
[2017-03-10 19:03:56 UTC] jwalker70: just ordered my replacement laptop
[2017-03-10 19:04:09 UTC] howlinthedeep: If you can't get monetization yet you might want to hold off on uploading videos Phil until you get it
[2017-03-10 19:04:12 UTC] ornightz: bck later
[2017-03-10 19:04:17 UTC] laundryfiend: I disagree. I think you're just throwing money away personally.
[2017-03-10 19:04:20 UTC] poorlymade: Well I'm just glad things seem to working out well.
[2017-03-10 19:04:21 UTC] laundryfiend: But to each their own :)

[2017-03-10 22:40:58 UTC] podusmonens: I agree that gameplay > gfx but when the game drops under 30 fps (as it happens on switch) the gameplay goes to shit. so nintendo = FAIL
[2017-03-10 22:41:00 UTC] howlinthedeep: No way you typed it all out that quick jimbob...I've only had a couple shots
[2017-03-10 22:41:05 UTC] masternutella: The gamecube was not terrible wtf you on
[2017-03-10 22:41:11 UTC] jiv_: as a handheld, the switch is the most portable handheld ever made, and guarantees the PokÃ©mon games will come to it
[2017-03-10 22:41:12 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @podusmonens, Yup.
[2017-03-10 22:41:14 UTC] encelor: @Butter__My__Bread it was cheap tho

[2017-03-10 22:41:39 UTC] butter__my__bread: it had one good game (mario 1000 yr door). the rest were remastered on wii and made better
[2017-03-10 22:41:39 UTC] jmon_1985: been playing games around/under 30fps all my life. not a big deal
[2017-03-10 22:41:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: lol anon :D
[2017-03-10 22:41:42 UTC] vashyoyo: gameplay doesn't go to shit in this game though lol even with framerate problems...its not like its a multiplayer FPS game or anything
[2017-03-10 22:41:44 UTC] oo_gero_oo: dunno, zelda looks amazing on my tv. Also the fps drops are way less frequent after the first zone so its not a big deal
[2017-03-10 22:41:49 UTC] vashyoyo: or that you die cause of framerate probelsm you don't
[2017-03-10 22:41:53 UTC] cplkevlar: Nintendo is retarded. They pissed off third party devs during the 90's and never recovered. Why do you think they always stick to their 1st party games and Ninten-drones to stay a float. THey're like heroin dealers.

[2017-03-10 22:43:40 UTC] jiv_: once games like fire emblem, animal crossing and pokÃ©mon come to switch, people will understand the design logic behind the switch

[2017-03-10 22:47:03 UTC] podusmonens: a game like zelda commands your full attention. I wouldn't want to be on a train, for example, and be completely unaware of what's happening around me. but that's subjective
[2017-03-10 22:47:09 UTC] encelor: @Vendatus isn't that ages ago?
[2017-03-10 22:47:16 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @podusmonens, Good point.

[2017-03-10 22:48:24 UTC] jiv_: Zelda lasts about 3 hours 20 on lowest brightness and in airplane mode; other games can last 7+ hours, so that's pretty good battery life
[2017-03-10 22:48:52 UTC] cplkevlar: Implying that people that buy the Switch are healthy enough to go outside,
