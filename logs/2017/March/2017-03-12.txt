[2017-03-12 00:19:01 UTC] yacherdy: EleGiggle
[2017-03-12 00:19:06 UTC] yacherdy: uh oh jimbob
[2017-03-12 00:19:06 UTC] darthvidarviking: when are we supposed to save the daylight it is in summer or winter?
[2017-03-12 00:19:30 UTC] howlinthedeep: well the clock is being pushed back an hour tommorrow
[2017-03-12 00:19:35 UTC] podusmonens: I want big views for Chad
[2017-03-12 00:19:37 UTC] howlinthedeep: so starting in the winter i guess
[2017-03-12 00:19:51 UTC] podusmonens: big cheers
[2017-03-12 00:20:08 UTC] podusmonens: subs up the wazoo
[2017-03-12 00:20:14 UTC] darthvidarviking: interesting subject I never thought of it now I would have to read about it
[2017-03-12 00:20:51 UTC] howlinthedeep: yeah wikipedia has a nice article on it
[2017-03-12 00:21:05 UTC] yacherdy: well if it happens dragin it happens Kappa
[2017-03-12 00:21:28 UTC] darthvidarviking: during summer months by one hour so that evening daylight lasts an hour longer, while sacrificing normal sunrise times.
[2017-03-12 00:21:42 UTC] darthvidarviking: so winter is the standard time
[2017-03-12 00:21:45 UTC] darthvidarviking: how stupid
[2017-03-12 00:21:51 UTC] darthvidarviking: I though it was the other way around
[2017-03-12 00:21:56 UTC] yacherdy: blame Chris Martin's great grandfather or whatever
[2017-03-12 00:22:04 UTC] yacherdy: I think he created it
[2017-03-12 00:22:40 UTC] darthvidarviking: it would make sense to save the daylight in winter, but in sommer it is light all the fucking time. At least where i am from
[2017-03-12 00:23:43 UTC] howlinthedeep: hmmmmm yeah it was originally for farmers so they would have more time
[2017-03-12 00:23:52 UTC] howlinthedeep: ...but not that farmers care about the time anyways
[2017-03-12 00:24:14 UTC] yacherdy: Time is an illusion
[2017-03-12 00:24:15 UTC] yacherdy: Kappa
[2017-03-12 00:24:39 UTC] darthvidarviking: haha
[2017-03-12 00:24:58 UTC] yacherdy: Philosophical pothead talk Kappa
[2017-03-12 00:25:00 UTC] howlinthedeep: lol... it's a wibbly wobbly ball yacherdy
[2017-03-12 00:25:20 UTC] darthvidarviking: the reasoning for it is even to save power. We have to get up an hour earlier in summer because of that Lame
[2017-03-12 00:25:51 UTC] darthvidarviking: let's get those lazy pessants up an hour earlier in summer so they don't comsume all that energy.
[2017-03-12 00:26:03 UTC] yacherdy: damn peasants
[2017-03-12 00:26:37 UTC] darthvidarviking: now i understand why russia got rid of it
[2017-03-12 00:27:05 UTC] howlinthedeep: I think it would just be less confusing without this daylight savings stuff
[2017-03-12 00:27:18 UTC] darthvidarviking: most definentely
[2017-03-12 00:27:22 UTC] yacherdy: Well, anyways..I'm logging off for good...enjoy the rest of your day/morning/night whatever it may be.

[2017-03-12 18:23:28 UTC] yacherdy: I started late, half way through season 3 but better late than never

[2017-03-12 19:31:38 UTC] destr94: @DarksydePhil tips for cooking. In general you dont want to add more than 1 item with different status effects to a meal. Use 1 item with status effect and the other 4 should be general cooking items like meats and herbs

[2017-03-12 22:29:04 UTC] mastersaruwatari: this Zelda is so fucking monotone.
[2017-03-12 22:29:12 UTC] outinz: all are shit apart from the original pokemon red
[2017-03-12 22:29:15 UTC] kekon3: wait is that supposed to be Mipha?
[2017-03-12 22:29:16 UTC] blue_blur64: Besides the internet connectivity issues, I've had 0 issues
[2017-03-12 22:29:16 UTC] mastersaruwatari: who is this woman?
[2017-03-12 22:29:17 UTC] conky89: Lets be honest, when do Nintendo games ever have good voice acting?
[2017-03-12 22:29:19 UTC] mastersaruwatari: is this her first role?
[2017-03-12 22:29:22 UTC] betheboom: silent i would assume they are nearly the same as wii u except the d-pad
[2017-03-12 22:29:22 UTC] clonehat11: How did he ever defeat the Lynel??

[2017-03-12 22:29:37 UTC] kekon3: @Conky89 Fire Emblem is alright, Xenoblade did good
[2017-03-12 22:29:38 UTC] blue_blur64: He didn't clonehat
[2017-03-12 22:29:42 UTC] ginosaji8: you missed one more DUN somone192 you have to cheer again
[2017-03-12 22:29:46 UTC] mastersaruwatari: if so trauma center
[2017-03-12 22:29:55 UTC] encelor: even miniscap has better plot than this zelda
[2017-03-12 22:29:59 UTC] kekon3: Oh that right, they did trauma center too
[2017-03-12 22:30:05 UTC] mastersaruwatari: trauma center has amazing voice acting.
[2017-03-12 22:30:11 UTC] therealandy1: CoolStoryBob

[2017-03-12 22:30:25 UTC] conky89: I think
[2017-03-12 22:30:25 UTC] howlinthedeep: he also missed a cheer from the collecting arrows fetch quest gino
[2017-03-12 22:30:32 UTC] kekon3: Both of the ones for the wii were good
[2017-03-12 22:30:36 UTC] jiv_: @Conky89 the xenoblade chronicles games and kid icarus uprising
[2017-03-12 22:30:40 UTC] mastersaruwatari: what was the other one?
[2017-03-12 22:30:43 UTC] kekon3: actually there were three games
[2017-03-12 22:30:43 UTC] vendatus: This game would look and run better if Switch had the power of PS4 hell even Xbox Kappa
[2017-03-12 22:30:47 UTC] mastersaruwatari: i also love the translation and voice acting.
[2017-03-12 22:30:51 UTC] mastersaruwatari: there is so much science.
[2017-03-12 22:30:57 UTC] betheboom: FOR NOTHING

[2017-03-12 22:31:29 UTC] iixo: *ladder
[2017-03-12 22:31:29 UTC] outinz: the level design is so fucking atrocious in this game I want to vomit
[2017-03-12 22:31:32 UTC] mxtt10589: bomb it?
[2017-03-12 22:31:36 UTC] mattocat: It's a ladder up if you messed up and fall
[2017-03-12 22:31:43 UTC] betheboom: that dont look like a laddersorry
[2017-03-12 22:31:44 UTC] blue_blur64: we must be seeing 2 different things outinz

[2017-03-12 22:32:33 UTC] boomhouer8606: Ladder to nowhere? Sounds like the future to any Wal-Mart manager...
[2017-03-12 22:32:35 UTC] podusmonens: outinz the switch/wii u are very limited in their graphical output so even if they wanted they couldn;t pull off better desgned
[2017-03-12 22:32:37 UTC] betheboom: jimbob :O he dropped the halberd
[2017-03-12 22:32:39 UTC] howlinthedeep: yes get rid of the weapon that never broke
[2017-03-12 22:32:46 UTC] podusmonens: design*
[2017-03-12 22:32:54 UTC] doctorzzz: this is gonna take him ages
[2017-03-12 22:33:01 UTC] betheboom: dragin wii u is 720 and switch is 900
[2017-03-12 22:33:06 UTC] alsocookies: Is this his first divine beast?
[2017-03-12 22:33:06 UTC] sirgreenday: he's such a horrible gamer. Unbelievable.
[2017-03-12 22:33:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the halberd only run is over now betheboom :(
[2017-03-12 22:33:09 UTC] eternia_forever: dspHmm dspHmm dspSurpriseddsp dspSurpriseddsp
[2017-03-12 22:33:13 UTC] mademesignup: will he rage quit the dungeon or beat it?
[2017-03-12 22:33:13 UTC] mattocat: I think Phil missed the point of the map
[2017-03-12 22:33:20 UTC] blue_blur64: Zelda specifically bethe
[2017-03-12 22:33:26 UTC] betheboom: jimbob im sorry man :(
[2017-03-12 22:33:27 UTC] podusmonens: not talking abouut rezolution
[2017-03-12 22:33:30 UTC] podusmonens: the gpu itself
[2017-03-12 22:33:32 UTC] outinz: wii u and switch are as garbage as each other, not even game systems, better to stream porn off it and wank with it instead
[2017-03-12 22:33:53 UTC] jiv_: FailFish
[2017-03-12 22:34:07 UTC] mastersaruwatari: what?
[2017-03-12 22:34:13 UTC] blue_blur64: 100 silver rupees? God damn, Phil would be rich LUL
[2017-03-12 22:34:22 UTC] boomhouer8606: @outinz Haha, you can start on the TV, and finish in the bathroom. That's the power of the Switch!
[2017-03-12 22:34:40 UTC] outinz: @boomhouer8606 haha
[2017-03-12 22:34:44 UTC] podusmonens: that's what the switch will end up doing outinz, porn on the go just like the PSP (aka PSPorn)
[2017-03-12 22:34:45 UTC] mastersaruwatari: i think making it a hybrid was once trying too be to ocute.
[2017-03-12 22:34:51 UTC] betheboom: wii u and switch are shit when it comes to graphics ans such hence the low HD and 20 fps frame lock on this game
[2017-03-12 22:34:52 UTC] sirgreenday: You sword that you would NEVER go vack to Twitch. Now that nobody would give you a contract, you came to the only place thatll have you. You're such a fraud.
[2017-03-12 22:34:59 UTC] imnotme1980: kill the eyeball
[2017-03-12 22:35:00 UTC] mastersaruwatari: what was wrong with just making the a plain old console.
[2017-03-12 22:35:03 UTC] blue_blur64: bethe, there is no framelock
[2017-03-12 22:35:07 UTC] blue_blur64: what are you talking about? xD
[2017-03-12 22:35:10 UTC] outinz: yes psp was the first for porn
[2017-03-12 22:35:12 UTC] prodigy2365: There is a terminal in the small wheel
[2017-03-12 22:35:12 UTC] betheboom: nintendo need to UP there game by like 100 x to compete anymore
[2017-03-12 22:35:12 UTC] outinz: lul
[2017-03-12 22:35:18 UTC] doctorzzz: LUL lucky
[2017-03-12 22:35:18 UTC] drilbit777: @betheboom, Zelda runs at 30fps, it actually only drops during certain areas
[2017-03-12 22:35:27 UTC] iixo: the eyeball died
[2017-03-12 22:35:29 UTC] betheboom: silent i heard it locks at 20 minimum
[2017-03-12 22:35:32 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @MasterSaruwatari plain old consoles don't attract the soccer moms who are all on mobile games
[2017-03-12 22:35:34 UTC] betheboom: not max though
[2017-03-12 22:35:39 UTC] encelor: stasis and hit?
[2017-03-12 22:35:42 UTC] legendoflinq: map time
[2017-03-12 22:35:46 UTC] howlinthedeep: silent is probably playing it on the switch
[2017-03-12 22:35:47 UTC] podusmonens: 20 frames is pathetic bethe
[2017-03-12 22:35:50 UTC] boomhouer8606: @MasterSaruwatari Why do that when you can make a gimmick console but make an identical Mario game for it anyway? haha
[2017-03-12 22:35:51 UTC] podusmonens: PATHETIC
[2017-03-12 22:35:52 UTC] mastersaruwatari: @ufccurbstomp pointless to go after them.
[2017-03-12 22:35:52 UTC] blue_blur64: Guys, don't say anything :P
[2017-03-12 22:35:57 UTC] betheboom: i wonder how long it will take
[2017-03-12 22:36:03 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @MasterSaruwatari Go tell Nintendo that
[2017-03-12 22:36:05 UTC] drilbit777: I'm playing it on Wii U and the game runs fine for me
[2017-03-12 22:36:07 UTC] dezerved: ocarina of time ran at 20 fps
[2017-03-12 22:36:07 UTC] eternia_forever: chesty breasty
[2017-03-12 22:36:09 UTC] doctorzzz: if we dont say anything this is gonna take hours
[2017-03-12 22:36:11 UTC] betheboom: dragin i know but that in minimum
[2017-03-12 22:36:13 UTC] drilbit777: Only framerate issues i've had is during towns
[2017-03-12 22:36:14 UTC] howlinthedeep: So here's how you beat this dungeon
[2017-03-12 22:36:19 UTC] mastersaruwatari: @ufccurbstomp don't think English is their first language.
[2017-03-12 22:36:20 UTC] capstonegaming: hit it the wrong way
[2017-03-12 22:36:20 UTC] howlinthedeep: Get to the boss room and beat the boss
[2017-03-12 22:36:22 UTC] capstonegaming: facepalm
[2017-03-12 22:36:27 UTC] mastersaruwatari: their fanboys are insane.
[2017-03-12 22:36:40 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @MasterSaruwatari They wouldn't understand even if you told them in Japanese
[2017-03-12 22:36:42 UTC] betheboom: deep that is true but there is NO boss room
[2017-03-12 22:36:44 UTC] mastersaruwatari: they really think unique equals good.
[2017-03-12 22:36:49 UTC] eternia_forever: da fuck
[2017-03-12 22:36:50 UTC] detractorstopperphil: NotLikeThis
[2017-03-12 22:36:52 UTC] podusmonens: max: 30 fps. min: 20 fps. wow. great console.
[2017-03-12 22:36:57 UTC] betheboom: there is a BOSS
[2017-03-12 22:37:00 UTC] blue_blur64: podus, that's just Zelda
[2017-03-12 22:37:07 UTC] bernielomax517: Damn some of that merch is pretty sick there Phil
[2017-03-12 22:37:07 UTC] blue_blur64: Remember, they made the switch port in one year
[2017-03-12 22:37:20 UTC] boomhouer8606: @MasterSaruwatari Yeah, my buddy had a friend that tried to tell him Wii U was the best console BECAUSE it only had first party titles...
[2017-03-12 22:37:21 UTC] drilbit777: @podusmonens, Just cause 3 on PS4 ran at like 20fps too and drops frequently
[2017-03-12 22:37:21 UTC] blue_blur64: And the other games are 1080p 60fps
[2017-03-12 22:37:22 UTC] capstonegaming: didnt work did it
[2017-03-12 22:37:23 UTC] howlinthedeep: yeah...well I'm not gonna spoil it though
[2017-03-12 22:37:28 UTC] podusmonens: most likely newer games will require more power. so if a brand new game drops under 30, how about future onws?
[2017-03-12 22:37:32 UTC] podusmonens: just think
[2017-03-12 22:37:37 UTC] podusmonens: ones*
[2017-03-12 22:37:37 UTC] betheboom: silent only cause they wanted zelda to be released with the switch
[2017-03-12 22:37:43 UTC] mastersaruwatari: i mean not some of the games between ps4 and switch.
[2017-03-12 22:37:45 UTC] mattocat: its like a wheel... and things are turned
[2017-03-12 22:37:48 UTC] mastersaruwatari: the switch games are getting downscale.
[2017-03-12 22:37:49 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, that's what I'm saying
[2017-03-12 22:37:51 UTC] podusmonens: ps4 sucks aswell
[2017-03-12 22:37:53 UTC] sproutdelicious: chat! don't tell him :D
[2017-03-12 22:37:59 UTC] betheboom: dragin cahman now
[2017-03-12 22:37:59 UTC] mastersaruwatari: fanboys are like, "Stupid developers with the shit ports!"
[2017-03-12 22:38:00 UTC] dezerved: why are you fucking arguing it podus, jesus fuck, people want to hate on everything new/ nintendo
[2017-03-12 22:38:02 UTC] conky89: That has been the things about Nintendo Consoles as of late. Good first party games but not many third party games
[2017-03-12 22:38:03 UTC] westreamnogames: @DarksydePhil look at the map there is an new option!
[2017-03-12 22:38:04 UTC] dezerved: grab a fucking ticket
[2017-03-12 22:38:10 UTC] betheboom: calm down nintendo is one thing
[2017-03-12 22:38:16 UTC] betheboom: but calm down now
[2017-03-12 22:38:19 UTC] doctorzzz: no grapgical 3rd party game will run good on switch, its a nintendo only thing again
[2017-03-12 22:38:25 UTC] gilliumthekid: this took me a moment to figure out as well
[2017-03-12 22:38:31 UTC] blue_blur64: Zelda is a bad game to use to say that's how strong the console is
[2017-03-12 22:38:34 UTC] conky89: They just are not attractive to developers
[2017-03-12 22:38:34 UTC] aloofone: lol hes pissed
[2017-03-12 22:38:48 UTC] bomber_man_mulayim: What happened to wolf link
[2017-03-12 22:39:00 UTC] betheboom: zelda is the main reason anyone bought the console though silent
[2017-03-12 22:39:03 UTC] kekon3: He summoned him once and didn't do it again
[2017-03-12 22:39:04 UTC] ufccurbstomp: @DoctorZzZ the fact that skyrim on switch is the original version proves the switch has no real power
[2017-03-12 22:39:07 UTC] eternia_forever: "nature" is calling brb
[2017-03-12 22:39:14 UTC] hellscream112: !uptime
[2017-03-12 22:39:14 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: skyrim will be on switch
[2017-03-12 22:39:14 UTC] detractorstopperphil: OSfrog
[2017-03-12 22:39:14 UTC] betheboom: they didnt buy it for 1 2 switch or bomberman
[2017-03-12 22:39:17 UTC] mademesignup: #erecttrunk
[2017-03-12 22:39:21 UTC] supatune: when does the stream end? 20 mins?
[2017-03-12 22:39:24 UTC] jiv_: once their portble franchises, like fire emblem, pokémon, animal crossing etc come to the switch, people will understand that making a hybrid made more sense than a home console.
[2017-03-12 22:39:26 UTC] podusmonens: you don;t even know that even the most basic gaming pc doesn;t drop below 40fps if you drop the settings a bit on any game..why would you accept a brand new console that can't even do 30 fps constantly
[2017-03-12 22:39:32 UTC] gilliumthekid: hamster in a wheel
[2017-03-12 22:39:36 UTC] conky89: One only plays skyrim on the PC
[2017-03-12 22:39:43 UTC] westreamnogames: dspWowdude no shout out i see u phil
[2017-03-12 22:39:45 UTC] podusmonens: why do you accept garbage down your throat
[2017-03-12 22:39:50 UTC] capstonegaming: place a climbing brick under the window and ump in
[2017-03-12 22:39:52 UTC] betheboom: dragin i dont use pc sorry
[2017-03-12 22:40:06 UTC] mattocat: needs water
[2017-03-12 22:40:12 UTC] mastersaruwatari: but here is nintendo problem.
[2017-03-12 22:40:13 UTC] betheboom: i use nintendo a little and ps4 sorry man
[2017-03-12 22:40:14 UTC] randomron005: Embrace your inner hamster, Phil!
[2017-03-12 22:40:15 UTC] drilbit777: @podusmonens, You're talking about one game that was ported from the Wii U and using that as the basis for console.
[2017-03-12 22:40:16 UTC] blue_blur64: podus, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Splatoon 2 are 1080p/60fps
[2017-03-12 22:40:17 UTC] podusmonens: of course you don't
[2017-03-12 22:40:22 UTC] jiv_: The problem with Wii U was their internal development teams were developing for 2 completely different platform, which resulted in game droughts on both of them.
[2017-03-12 22:40:26 UTC] dezerved: if you only thing about frame rate and graphical fidelity you are looking at the wrong company, and probablt should just ignore nintendo
[2017-03-12 22:40:27 UTC] mastersaruwatari: they need something that isn't just for Nintendo fans.
[2017-03-12 22:40:28 UTC] conky89: Its not like games from the previous generations are taxing on current computers
[2017-03-12 22:40:34 UTC] betheboom: ITS A PUZZLE
[2017-03-12 22:40:35 UTC] encelor: the door open when it goes blue
[2017-03-12 22:40:39 UTC] drilbit777: Even the PS4 struggled to keep a consistent framerate at launch like with Knack or killzone
[2017-03-12 22:40:39 UTC] betheboom: figure it out
[2017-03-12 22:40:42 UTC] mastersaruwatari: SMT is a step in the right direction.
[2017-03-12 22:40:47 UTC] aloofone: yes figure it out
[2017-03-12 22:40:49 UTC] doctorzzz: FailFish
[2017-03-12 22:40:58 UTC] drilbit777: Plus if you wanna talk about launch titles Fast RMX ran at 1080p 60fps
[2017-03-12 22:41:00 UTC] iixo: *door opens* what is it doing?
[2017-03-12 22:41:01 UTC] aloofone: we came to watch you fighure it out not us tell you
[2017-03-12 22:41:03 UTC] ginosaji8: NotLikeThis
[2017-03-12 22:41:03 UTC] podusmonens: framerate should be essential fro every company, I don't care about eyecandy
[2017-03-12 22:41:04 UTC] vendatus: the gate opened LUL
[2017-03-12 22:41:10 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: pc overpowers console by so much these days
[2017-03-12 22:41:11 UTC] conky89: Oh yeah

[2017-03-12 22:41:48 UTC] conky89: If a game runs poorly on PC its because of a half-assed port

[2017-03-12 22:44:16 UTC] conky89: Yeah but it was very polarizing and sold poorly
[2017-03-12 22:44:17 UTC] blue_blur64: Phil's having better luck finding ancient cores than me lol
[2017-03-12 22:44:17 UTC] jiv_: when Pokémon Stars comes out, Switch will be flying off shelves, lol

[2017-03-12 22:44:49 UTC] conky89: Pokemon has been selling like crazy
[2017-03-12 22:44:56 UTC] drilbit777: @betheboom, It is going to be good lol It supposed to go back to the older styled games like sunshine or Mario 64
[2017-03-12 22:45:00 UTC] randomron005: It's a Mario game. Of course Nintendo's gonna put more effort into it.
[2017-03-12 22:45:02 UTC] gilliumthekid: think, Phil
[2017-03-12 22:45:02 UTC] iixo: yes you can freeze the flow

[2017-03-12 22:45:38 UTC] conky89: Man did FE make it by the skin of its ass
[2017-03-12 22:45:44 UTC] betheboom: nintendo love zelda, pokemon and mario those are there 3 main franchises
[2017-03-12 22:45:57 UTC] podusmonens: no 3rd party support = the switch fails.. it's that simple. you can talk pokemon and mario all day long
[2017-03-12 22:46:00 UTC] jiv_: all of Nintendo's franchises on one system = awesome. For everything else, I have a PC
[2017-03-12 22:46:01 UTC] conky89: Nintendo nearly stopped funding the games but Awakening saved the series

[2017-03-12 22:46:41 UTC] randomron005: Nintendo needs the 3rd party games because we know the other 1st party games won't see the light of day.
[2017-03-12 22:46:43 UTC] podusmonens: but hey, nintendo can photoshop skyrim screencaps on the switch screen to trick buyers

[2017-03-12 22:52:48 UTC] conky89: Hey at least any engines that Nintendo uses cannot be as expensive as the ones Square-Enix makes
