[2017-03-31 17:54:49 UTC] akioartorius: hi
[2017-03-31 17:54:55 UTC] darksydephil: getting set up now
[2017-03-31 17:54:58 UTC] darksydephil: not much left in zelda!
[2017-03-31 17:55:04 UTC] yacherdy: Hello
[2017-03-31 17:55:11 UTC] blue_blur64: There was a new patch that came out for the game
[2017-03-31 17:55:15 UTC] yacherdy: Will this be the 2nd to last stream of Zelda?
[2017-03-31 17:55:46 UTC] akioartorius: Truthfully, Phil I don't think it matters but you missed the shira set in the dlc. but whatever
[2017-03-31 17:56:38 UTC] yacherdy: Oh...says in title: Endgame stream
[2017-03-31 17:56:45 UTC] yacherdy: Guess that means the final one..
[2017-03-31 17:56:46 UTC] darksydephil: oh boy
[2017-03-31 17:56:47 UTC] darksydephil: a patch?
[2017-03-31 17:56:56 UTC] darksydephil: how doyou install it, let me get it going now. nintendo servers are slow as hell
[2017-03-31 17:57:21 UTC] blue_blur64: It should automatically install once you choose the game. Patches normally don't take long
[2017-03-31 17:57:44 UTC] yacherdy: I think the system updates take long but the game patches should be relatively quick.
[2017-03-31 17:57:56 UTC] sydthesquid1195: Hey Phil! Been Watching you since you started on youtube!! Belive I was in mid-jr high Have always loved the videos man!

[2017-03-31 18:04:30 UTC] bloodborne2day: and the haters :)
[2017-03-31 18:04:32 UTC] yacherdy: I think it's a common issue Silent..I'm trying to find a solution now
[2017-03-31 18:04:39 UTC] lvlpower: I want zelder dspDeath
[2017-03-31 18:04:39 UTC] darthvidarviking: yeah man. You showed that series. :)
[2017-03-31 18:04:44 UTC] blue_blur64: It's strange to see a series end naturally like this lol
[2017-03-31 18:04:45 UTC] coralguy: Yes sirrr
[2017-03-31 18:05:10 UTC] yacherdy: Some people are saying turning the Switch off and then back on fixed DNS issues Silent
[2017-03-31 18:05:35 UTC] yacherdy: not that that's some revolutionary fix
[2017-03-31 18:05:40 UTC] darthvidarviking: hahaha
[2017-03-31 18:05:52 UTC] blue_blur64: Well, I'll try that then
[2017-03-31 18:06:07 UTC] blue_blur64: I actually just saw that fix as well xD
[2017-03-31 18:06:13 UTC] yacherdy: but I guess it would maybe flush the dns? I don't know.
[2017-03-31 18:06:20 UTC] yacherdy: lol

[2017-03-31 18:07:58 UTC] yacherdy: I'm a genius.
[2017-03-31 18:08:04 UTC] blue_blur64: I think the issue with this is that there is no option to just fully turn it off unless you hold the power button down
[2017-03-31 18:08:06 UTC] yacherdy: Kreygasm
[2017-03-31 18:08:24 UTC] blue_blur64: That just doesn't make sense to me
[2017-03-31 18:08:29 UTC] yacherdy: yeah...and putting it into sleep mode would apparently not work
[2017-03-31 18:08:38 UTC] yacherdy: a full system reboot
[2017-03-31 18:08:59 UTC] blue_blur64: Nice, I got my first friend request from the Splatoon 2 Testfire Kappa
[2017-03-31 18:09:30 UTC] darksydephil: ok update is done!
[2017-03-31 18:09:33 UTC] darksydephil: turning on the stream now
[2017-03-31 18:09:42 UTC] coralguy: Woot woot
[2017-03-31 18:09:55 UTC] darthvidarviking: alright
[2017-03-31 18:10:19 UTC] bloodborne2day: anybody else order the Persona 5 steelbook from Amazon?
[2017-03-31 18:10:20 UTC] blue_blur64: So for the update, if it's the same as the switch version, does improve the framerate overall. Although dense forests and especially the korok forest will still be bad, just not as bad
[2017-03-31 18:10:34 UTC] bloodborne2day: I am hoping to get a controller skin with it
[2017-03-31 18:10:57 UTC] blue_blur64: Nope, just got it digitally since Sony gave me $100 LUL
[2017-03-31 18:11:00 UTC] jmon_1985: wow now ads taking up half of the stream chat.
[2017-03-31 18:11:08 UTC] bloodborne2day: $100 for buying a ps4?

[2017-03-31 20:46:22 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Are you hyped for WrestleMania?
[2017-03-31 20:46:35 UTC] damiennoctis: There was probably a quest that also told you how to get to the shrine.
[2017-03-31 20:46:36 UTC] voltairesurge: i finished it and its a solid 8.5
[2017-03-31 20:46:39 UTC] chappelliot: is this the guy who wanks on stream​
[2017-03-31 20:46:39 UTC] jdomican: did he beat the game yet?
[2017-03-31 20:46:41 UTC] yacherdy: 2/10 would be Superman 64 level...I don't think its that bad
[2017-03-31 20:46:44 UTC] mizorelover: Honestly it really annoys me how people put down Andromeda. I'll probably give it a 8 or 8.5 by the end.
[2017-03-31 20:46:46 UTC] scott_parker8: Goldberg
[2017-03-31 20:46:46 UTC] yacherdy: thats just me

[2017-03-31 20:47:30 UTC] breaker033: get a flute
[2017-03-31 20:47:36 UTC] thewhitedeerofficial: are you going to play the Guardians of the galaxy game by Telltale?
[2017-03-31 20:47:51 UTC] voltairesurge: do the trilogy phil
[2017-03-31 20:47:53 UTC] bloodborne2day: We had a problem processing that request (403).
[2017-03-31 20:47:54 UTC] lemonlimelukey: if only phil played this game the proper way and not the adhd autist way, but he doesnt learn so he'll never know what hes missing out on
[2017-03-31 20:48:00 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Undertaker and Roman Reigns for who's YARD
[2017-03-31 20:48:09 UTC] yacherdy: If I get to see Bayley's booty it'll be worth it
[2017-03-31 20:48:13 UTC] bloodborne2day: Goldberg rocks!!
[2017-03-31 20:48:18 UTC] anondublo1: @MizoreLover because it's a ME game, it's being held to the same standards as the previous games, gonna get railed for the missing the high bar set
[2017-03-31 20:48:22 UTC] howlinthedeep: hahaha yacherdy
[2017-03-31 20:48:29 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil You should get a hug from Bayley
[2017-03-31 20:48:30 UTC] fluttershy1970: what about triple h vs seth rollins phill that might be fun
[2017-03-31 20:48:41 UTC] betheboom: cherdy you get to see bayley, sasha, alexa, becky lynch, carmella

[2017-03-31 20:48:49 UTC] yacherdy: thats a good combo bethe
[2017-03-31 20:48:55 UTC] wolfofthedawn: honestly andromeda is 7/10 for me besides the facial animations, it's very glitchy and unpolished and has some crap dialouge and the voice acting sounds half assed, but if you like you like it, like i say too each their own
[2017-03-31 20:48:58 UTC] bobbi_ling: charlotte
[2017-03-31 20:48:58 UTC] yeahp0n: when the radar fades like that its usually above or below you
[2017-03-31 20:49:05 UTC] yacherdy: and Charlotte Kappa

[2017-03-31 20:50:13 UTC] mizorelover: @anondublo1 And that's a shame. I'll admit it isn't as good as them but it isn't bad. And most of their criticisms are stupid, like the facial animations. ME has never had wonky faces. Sure. Whatever you say. lol
[2017-03-31 20:50:13 UTC] yacherdy: but I'm guessing Sasha might win?
[2017-03-31 20:50:18 UTC] yacherdy: I'm out of the loop
[2017-03-31 20:50:19 UTC] damiennoctis: Maybe having the map will help.

[2017-03-31 20:51:31 UTC] anondublo1: @MizoreLover well, to be fair, it's a narrative heavy game, like every bioware RPG, you're going to spend a lot of time in conversations, I think it's a valid point

[2017-03-31 20:52:05 UTC] scott_parker8: Ganon is easy
[2017-03-31 20:52:12 UTC] anondublo1: then you have silly things, like the backwards gun, it kind of shows how rushed things were

[2017-03-31 20:53:42 UTC] anondublo1: it's terrible, considering every major game reviewer gives any game that's playable at 9/10, so the numbers are fucking meaningless now
[2017-03-31 20:53:43 UTC] derichloveslemur: So ganon coming up next?
[2017-03-31 20:53:47 UTC] betheboom: you just think they are
[2017-03-31 20:53:48 UTC] mizorelover: @anondublo1 Honestly, I don't see it. Some of the dialogue has been weird and some characterization is wonky but I couldn't give less of a shit about the animations. I remember some weird looking shit in ME1 but apparently everyone's forgotten about that.
[2017-03-31 20:53:52 UTC] bobbi_ling: nioh saved gaming

[2017-03-31 20:55:47 UTC] howlinthedeep: well I like games that are hard because of it's difficulty, but it's true that that's not the only thing that makes games fun
[2017-03-31 20:55:53 UTC] voltairesurge: me3 ad weird faces too dude
[2017-03-31 20:56:03 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Theres suppose to be a silver lynel near zora's domain

[2017-03-31 20:56:14 UTC] voltairesurge: was just playinh it
[2017-03-31 20:56:18 UTC] xgameofpwns: I think games should be $70. people expect more and more of games nowadays and the price hasn't changed in 10 years and then the same people complain when they're bombarded with microtransactions instead of real content
[2017-03-31 20:56:19 UTC] betheboom: deep so you want a shitty game with super hard difficulty CAAAHMAAN
[2017-03-31 20:56:24 UTC] scott_parker8: Nintendo are detractors because Phil put his Wii U in the bin
[2017-03-31 20:56:25 UTC] yacherdy: well I still think theres a wide variety of games...and thats what Nioh, Dark Souls and some indie games are for
[2017-03-31 20:56:31 UTC] mizorelover: @anondublo1 And? Did that diminish the quality of the game back then? Everyone puts too much emphasis on graphics these days and feel entitled to them.
[2017-03-31 20:56:32 UTC] easton_taylor1: @popsicolo That Lizaflo was glitch
[2017-03-31 20:56:33 UTC] akioartorius: is it the sauron eye or sauron in general
[2017-03-31 20:56:33 UTC] howlinthedeep: i want a game that will chalange me
[2017-03-31 20:56:38 UTC] fullyjuicedup: Nintendo games should be no more than $40
[2017-03-31 20:56:43 UTC] yacherdy: gaming needs that variety to succeed
[2017-03-31 20:56:56 UTC] cm0n3ymillionair: phil once you do the final laberynth you should see if you have ingredients to upgrade barbarian armor since the bonuses are good
[2017-03-31 20:56:57 UTC] yacherdy: it can't all be story games, hard games, etc
[2017-03-31 20:57:00 UTC] amplifyed: theres no way they could double the price of a game without getting a crazy amount of backlash, regardless of what you seem to think
[2017-03-31 20:57:04 UTC] howlinthedeep: game that requires skill to suceed
[2017-03-31 20:57:04 UTC] damiennoctis: Games actually were more expensive in the past anyway.
[2017-03-31 20:57:06 UTC] betheboom: bobbi sauron is a eye connected to a tower and ganon is a flying monster i think ganon has it
[2017-03-31 20:57:10 UTC] derichloveslemur: Have you ever been to Zora's Domain Phil apparently a silver lynel will be waiting there
[2017-03-31 20:57:12 UTC] scott_parker8: Why are digital games more expensive than physical?
[2017-03-31 20:57:24 UTC] bobbi_ling: sauron was a knight art the start
[2017-03-31 20:57:29 UTC] saaraikaar: Actually. I think games are becoming about the same price as theywere in the past.
[2017-03-31 20:57:43 UTC] yacherdy: Games used to be like 90 bucks
[2017-03-31 20:57:50 UTC] betheboom: bobbi it depends on how strong the RING is against gnon
[2017-03-31 20:57:53 UTC] howlinthedeep: games were never 90 bucks
[2017-03-31 20:57:54 UTC] yacherdy: master system days EleGiggle
[2017-03-31 20:57:55 UTC] betheboom: ganon*
[2017-03-31 20:58:04 UTC] errnoent: @HowlintheDeep Yeah they were, some N64 titles
[2017-03-31 20:58:06 UTC] saaraikaar: Games were close to 80 bucks in the past
[2017-03-31 20:58:08 UTC] bobbi_ling: suron wins
[2017-03-31 20:58:09 UTC] bigcrichythegoat: Phil have you found the Akkala tech lab? You can get guardian weapons and arrows there along with armor
[2017-03-31 20:58:12 UTC] yacherdy: Dynamite Dux for 100 dollars
[2017-03-31 20:58:13 UTC] lastdanne91: Im in a video on youtube by darksydephil. When he play BF3 I kill him a couple times...miss the old day :/
[2017-03-31 20:58:15 UTC] saaraikaar: Then around PS2 it dropped to around 60
[2017-03-31 20:58:21 UTC] xgameofpwns: @YaCherdy yeah but it was the correct price for the production cost at the time
[2017-03-31 20:58:34 UTC] thewhitedeerofficial: the PS2 was the best
[2017-03-31 20:58:41 UTC] betheboom: daaaaaamn
[2017-03-31 20:58:42 UTC] yacherdy: true @Xgameofpwns
[2017-03-31 20:58:45 UTC] butter__my__bread: dev kits were super cheap back then tho
[2017-03-31 20:58:47 UTC] darthvidarviking: @YaCherdy Can't remember tehm being so expensive actually
[2017-03-31 20:58:50 UTC] yacherdy: 80 dollar games were always a thing
[2017-03-31 20:58:51 UTC] jmon_1985: @xgameofpwns games aren't even finished on launch day. Buggs every where you can pay 70 but I'll just wait to go down
[2017-03-31 20:58:54 UTC] bloodborne2day: ok, sorry to be a bother but do i need TWITCHPRIME to buy bits?
[2017-03-31 20:58:59 UTC] errnoent: N64 games were fucking stupidly expensive
[2017-03-31 20:58:59 UTC] bobbi_ling: ps2 is trash
[2017-03-31 20:59:03 UTC] errnoent: Another reason why I never bought one
[2017-03-31 20:59:05 UTC] butter__my__bread: anyone literally could make a bootleg game
[2017-03-31 20:59:05 UTC] justillusionz: I just joined, has Phile defeated the Ganon yet ?
[2017-03-31 20:59:08 UTC] saaraikaar: No you dont need twitch prime @bloodborne2day
[2017-03-31 20:59:11 UTC] yacherdy: @darthvidarviking maybe it depends on the system and games
[2017-03-31 20:59:16 UTC] yacherdy: I don't think it was universal
[2017-03-31 20:59:20 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil I really did enjoyed your Grim Fandango Remastered back in January 2015 it was fabulous.
[2017-03-31 20:59:21 UTC] bobbi_ling: n64 and dreamcast probably have best games
[2017-03-31 20:59:22 UTC] stuart360: We used to get ripped off soooo bad back in the day, games cost like 100 times less than today back then
[2017-03-31 20:59:22 UTC] popsicolo: They're still $80 if you want all the content.
[2017-03-31 20:59:26 UTC] derichloveslemur: hey @Saaraikaar
[2017-03-31 20:59:31 UTC] saaraikaar: Hi
[2017-03-31 20:59:34 UTC] damiennoctis: It is basically the same thing as the N64. Where Nintendo decides to use a different storage medium and has to charge more.
[2017-03-31 20:59:34 UTC] butter__my__bread: the average aaa game costs around 60 mil
[2017-03-31 20:59:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn elitists
[2017-03-31 20:59:39 UTC] howlinthedeep: nintendo masterrace jimbobo
[2017-03-31 20:59:40 UTC] stuart360: cost less to make i mean
[2017-03-31 20:59:42 UTC] howlinthedeep: *jimbob
[2017-03-31 20:59:44 UTC] marshmelons: and whats also worse is the prices for nintendo games never go down
[2017-03-31 20:59:56 UTC] anondublo1: lmao, only caught then end of that rant
[2017-03-31 21:00:05 UTC] bigcrichythegoat: Phil go by the Akkala sea you will find a tech lab that sells guardian weapons and arrows
[2017-03-31 21:00:06 UTC] errnoent: fuck N64 man
[2017-03-31 21:00:09 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Are you getting a new switch you thinking?
[2017-03-31 21:00:10 UTC] bobbi_ling: for honor is over 700 if you buy everything
[2017-03-31 21:00:13 UTC] errnoent: and Nintendo
[2017-03-31 21:00:15 UTC] yacherdy: only 700?
[2017-03-31 21:00:15 UTC] damiennoctis: How much are Nintendo games going to be when you include DLC and Amiibos?
[2017-03-31 21:00:16 UTC] ratchefan12: @DarksydePhil what did i miss phil had to watch my nieces
[2017-03-31 21:00:37 UTC] butter__my__bread: zelda has a $20 season pass, right?
[2017-03-31 21:00:39 UTC] howlinthedeep: over 700 yacherdy
[2017-03-31 21:00:42 UTC] yacherdy: If I buy everything in For Honor will I git gud?
[2017-03-31 21:00:44 UTC] akioartorius: "Get N or get out" -Nintendo, Anyone remember that?
[2017-03-31 21:00:45 UTC] damiennoctis: Yup
[2017-03-31 21:00:46 UTC] yacherdy: @HowlintheDeep PogChamp
[2017-03-31 21:00:53 UTC] derichloveslemur: @ratchefan12 nieces?
[2017-03-31 21:00:54 UTC] bigcrichythegoat: Go by the Akkala Sea Phil you will be able to purchase guardian weapons and arrows
[2017-03-31 21:00:55 UTC] betheboom: for honnor is a RIPOFF
[2017-03-31 21:01:04 UTC] bobbi_ling: for honor is bae
[2017-03-31 21:01:08 UTC] yacherdy: oh no

[2017-03-31 21:01:12 UTC] errnoent: pls kill me
[2017-03-31 21:01:18 UTC] betheboom: bobbi for honor fucking sucks ass
[2017-03-31 21:01:22 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, You planning to get a new switch. Sad your switch bricked on Day 1.
[2017-03-31 21:01:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: isn't there some train simulator game that would cost 2,000 bucks to buy all the dlc
[2017-03-31 21:01:31 UTC] darthvidarviking: The marked is so much bigger than back in the day too. The prices should in theory fall not go up...
[2017-03-31 21:01:32 UTC] butter__my__bread: $20 a year for a bare bone online experience n shitty retro games u dont even get too keep
[2017-03-31 21:01:40 UTC] butter__my__bread: to
[2017-03-31 21:01:41 UTC] akioartorius: PHil said he is NOT getting a new switch
[2017-03-31 21:01:50 UTC] yacherdy: GTA V online credit card money EleGiggle
[2017-03-31 21:01:52 UTC] anondublo1: @MizoreLover honestly I don't think that's entitlement, it's expectations -- I'd expect better from bioware, especially for a game that's narrative heavy, with a 40 million dollar budget Kappa
[2017-03-31 21:01:54 UTC] errnoent: Is there anything else to this game other than all of these stupid shrines?
[2017-03-31 21:01:57 UTC] bobbi_ling: beth you quit the beta cause YOU sucked
[2017-03-31 21:02:00 UTC] yacherdy: uh oh
[2017-03-31 21:02:04 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh boy
[2017-03-31 21:02:07 UTC] damiennoctis: I think he specifically said he wouldn't bother with the switch unless they actually release some games for it.
[2017-03-31 21:02:12 UTC] rosie012: the switch broke on the first day! that really sucks
[2017-03-31 21:02:18 UTC] bobbi_ling: you suck at all games beth. just stop gaming MingLee
[2017-03-31 21:02:18 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Have you ever been to Zora's Domain?
[2017-03-31 21:02:23 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Oh great, more bobbi/bethe cat fighting
[2017-03-31 21:02:24 UTC] howlinthedeep: even becky couldn't carry bethe...nothing he could do
[2017-03-31 21:02:28 UTC] wolfofthedawn: yeah well before the days of DLC and season passes companies hadto release new versions of games to add content
[2017-03-31 21:02:33 UTC] yacherdy: deep NotLikeThis
[2017-03-31 21:02:34 UTC] akioartorius: No Bomberman?
[2017-03-31 21:02:34 UTC] saaraikaar: @DarksydePhil does that mean you will throw the switch in the trash bin after
[2017-03-31 21:02:39 UTC] fgabriel26: rooYahaha rooYahaha You found me
[2017-03-31 21:02:45 UTC] yacherdy: @Bobbi_Ling NotLikeThis
[2017-03-31 21:02:47 UTC] bigcrichythegoat: Theres also a secret cave full of loot and a level 50 weapon across the Gerudo tower
[2017-03-31 21:02:47 UTC] butter__my__bread: get it for mario kart online
[2017-03-31 21:02:48 UTC] anondublo1: @MizoreLover it's not really a matter or graphics, but something that important in relation to the mechanics of the game -- i'd be like a shooter with bad gunplay, or a racing game with terrible physics
[2017-03-31 21:02:52 UTC] yacherdy: dsphmmm
[2017-03-31 21:02:53 UTC] betheboom: deep cahman no fair she is pregnant
[2017-03-31 21:02:56 UTC] betheboom: :D
[2017-03-31 21:02:59 UTC] blue_blur64: @Saaraikaar, he doesn't even have a switch right now
[2017-03-31 21:03:01 UTC] iconicmaster1: Disgea 5
[2017-03-31 21:03:03 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Are you talking about Mario Odyssey?
[2017-03-31 21:03:05 UTC] butter__my__bread: id watch phil play mario kart online
[2017-03-31 21:03:05 UTC] popsicolo: If you want to play Super Mario Odyssey, just mod Mario into GTA VI.
[2017-03-31 21:03:06 UTC] bobbi_ling: shes up the duff
[2017-03-31 21:03:09 UTC] dspfandood: has phil done the shitty gyro shrines
[2017-03-31 21:03:11 UTC] bobbi_ling: bun in the oven
[2017-03-31 21:03:13 UTC] saaraikaar: @blue_blur64 Oh. Whats he playing it on?
[2017-03-31 21:03:17 UTC] howlinthedeep: So being pregnant affects your ability to play video games? she probably got too emotional
[2017-03-31 21:03:20 UTC] blue_blur64: wii u
[2017-03-31 21:03:23 UTC] xgameofpwns: I'm craving to play some PS1 games like crash and spyro or tenchu sa..I wish sony would allow backwards compatibility
[2017-03-31 21:03:23 UTC] saaraikaar: Aaah
[2017-03-31 21:03:29 UTC] errnoent: Seriously guys, is there anything more to this game?
[2017-03-31 21:03:31 UTC] errnoent: Just shrines?
[2017-03-31 21:03:36 UTC] errnoent: over and over again
[2017-03-31 21:03:36 UTC] yacherdy: When I play TWD season 1 I get emotional like a pregnant woman
[2017-03-31 21:03:43 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil Mario Odyssey looks awesome.
[2017-03-31 21:03:44 UTC] anondublo1: $60 seems fine to me tbh, but price drops seem to take for fucking ever now
[2017-03-31 21:03:45 UTC] errnoent: oh and cooking
[2017-03-31 21:03:46 UTC] xgameofpwns: @errnoent and terrible soundtrack Kappa
[2017-03-31 21:03:52 UTC] errnoent: shrines and cooking, and a stupid soundtrack
[2017-03-31 21:03:53 UTC] butter__my__bread: honestly thismgame doesn't look like a masterpiece
[2017-03-31 21:03:58 UTC] errnoent: 10/10!
[2017-03-31 21:04:00 UTC] errnoent: GOTY!
[2017-03-31 21:04:00 UTC] damiennoctis: Phil has finished pretty much everything, story wise.
[2017-03-31 21:04:06 UTC] butter__my__bread: 10/10 my ass
[2017-03-31 21:04:12 UTC] rosie012: How does a pregnancy affect on how you play game? That is just a sad excuse
[2017-03-31 21:04:13 UTC] jmon_1985: 10/100
[2017-03-31 21:04:13 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @anondublo1, Well, you'll see price drops more frequently if the game isn't doing well like Mass Effect.
[2017-03-31 21:04:14 UTC] damiennoctis: So he's just finishing up some shrines before going to fight Ganon
[2017-03-31 21:04:16 UTC] darthvidarviking: but the game seem relatively bug free @Butter__My__Bread
[2017-03-31 21:04:26 UTC] anondublo1: Kappa
[2017-03-31 21:04:35 UTC] yacherdy: that moment people sent that reviewer guy death threats because he lowered BOTW's metacritic score by one point
[2017-03-31 21:04:37 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil you need to use the magnesis and the remote bombs probably.
[2017-03-31 21:04:37 UTC] bigcrichythegoat: This game is an 8/10 from me just beta it yesterday
[2017-03-31 21:04:38 UTC] mizorelover: @anondublo1 I guess I'm old-school or something cause I don't understand that mentality. And honestly I don't think that's true. It'd be more akin to a shooter having unrealistic gun designs. Sure, the gun nuts are gonna complain about it but everyone else won't care.
[2017-03-31 21:04:40 UTC] bobbi_ling: it has bad slowdown viking
[2017-03-31 21:04:46 UTC] anondublo1: but a lot of games seem to still be $60 like a year or two later, it's fucking crazy
[2017-03-31 21:04:56 UTC] wolfofthedawn: didn't take forever with andromeda Kappa @anondublo1
[2017-03-31 21:04:58 UTC] fullyjuicedup: Is he going to fight Voldemort soon?
[2017-03-31 21:04:59 UTC] yacherdy: Nintendo games never drop in price unfortuntely
[2017-03-31 21:05:03 UTC] butter__my__bread: Nintendo are programming geniuses
[2017-03-31 21:05:04 UTC] yacherdy: unfortunately*

[2017-03-31 21:05:29 UTC] markymark52: just use magnet
[2017-03-31 21:05:31 UTC] bobbi_ling: Nintendo are nearly as evil as sony. Microsoft are like angels compared
[2017-03-31 21:05:33 UTC] capstonegaming: is this ganons dungeon?
[2017-03-31 21:05:39 UTC] howlinthedeep: why next week capstone?
[2017-03-31 21:05:40 UTC] anondublo1: @MizoreLover well, more like the guns not feeling right, the character models are there, they just don't seem like people Kappa

[2017-03-31 21:06:15 UTC] bigcrichythegoat: magnet on chest phil

[2017-03-31 21:06:22 UTC] betheboom: bobbi stop thinking

[2017-03-31 21:06:46 UTC] darthvidarviking: that is probably true @Bobbi_Ling but it seem polished except for the preformance issues in certain places. Not everyone releases games like so relatively bug and glitch free.
[2017-03-31 21:06:47 UTC] xgameofpwns: @errnoent thats what im saying he could knock out the Nioh update missions before Persona 5 comes out

[2017-03-31 21:06:55 UTC] yacherdy: oh

[2017-03-31 21:07:01 UTC] rosie012: I hope it is the 3rd episode of The Walking Dead season 3.
[2017-03-31 21:07:05 UTC] mizorelover: @anondublo1 I guess people are gonna think what they will. God knows I can't change their minds but hopefully Andromeda sees good sales despite all the bad press it's been getting.
[2017-03-31 21:07:08 UTC] markymark52: Use magnet on other chest Phil.

[2017-03-31 22:01:44 UTC] yacherdy: @VoltaireSurge It was some great sci-fi sounding, mysterious music when you were talking to the "starchild" and then great piano music when you chose the ending
[2017-03-31 22:01:53 UTC] coralguy: would be cooler enemy type if it was human bottom half, zebra top
[2017-03-31 22:01:57 UTC] errnoent: they have just like "ding ding ding" and "womp womp womp"
[2017-03-31 22:01:58 UTC] encelor: Lynel Richie hello is it me you looking for

[2017-03-31 22:06:54 UTC] yacherdy: @VoltaireSurge Yeah you can't hold it to the same standard...people expected it to be action packed right from the start but that wasn't the reality of it. Needs time to build.

[2017-03-31 22:09:04 UTC] yacherdy: @VoltaireSurge The way I see it...not to sound old and cranky but people like to jump on the hate train and hate something like everyone else does and don't give the game proper credit. Is the game the best ever? Of course not, but it's certainly not horrible.

[2017-03-31 22:27:24 UTC] markymark52: It's easier if you just use stasis on the ball.
[2017-03-31 22:27:26 UTC] kushiyakitori: why are you stepping off the elvator?

[2017-03-31 22:28:08 UTC] kushiyakitori: @Derichloveslemur, no. its not stasis at all

[2017-03-31 22:28:18 UTC] anondublo1: reminds me of the last 99 dungeons Kappa
[2017-03-31 22:28:19 UTC] markymark52: Phil just use stasis on the ball and run over there. It's easier.

[2017-03-31 22:30:09 UTC] scott_parker8: Leave the useless chest
[2017-03-31 22:30:23 UTC] derichloveslemur: Can you use magnesis on the chest?
[2017-03-31 22:30:36 UTC] derichloveslemur: would that work out or no
[2017-03-31 22:30:37 UTC] dragonjarvis: stasis the ball before it rolls in
[2017-03-31 22:30:46 UTC] blue_blur64: It takes some timing with the blocks to get that chest
[2017-03-31 22:30:53 UTC] errnoent: What Phil's doing right now is like when you gotta go to the principal's office and you start walking slower than you've ever walked in your life hoping the bell is gonna ring before you make it there
[2017-03-31 22:31:00 UTC] kushiyakitori: the chest is the only thing you'd use stasis for. otherwise you dont need it
[2017-03-31 22:31:06 UTC] anondublo1: a boy you probably don't need because it'll break in ten seconds
[2017-03-31 22:31:11 UTC] anondublo1: bow*
[2017-03-31 22:31:16 UTC] darthvidarviking: fuck the chest it is just some knights bow or useless item anyways

[2017-03-31 22:31:19 UTC] derichloveslemur: A phrenic bow is a sheikah bow Phil.
[2017-03-31 22:31:24 UTC] yacherdy: uh oh bethe
[2017-03-31 22:31:25 UTC] derichloveslemur: apparently
[2017-03-31 22:31:34 UTC] kriegal: You don't even have to do the puzzle. Put the blocks up top to make a path to the chest. Place the ball right next to where it's supposed to go and stasis it. Ta-da
[2017-03-31 22:31:38 UTC] dude_in_frames: use the block to cut the wind
[2017-03-31 22:31:39 UTC] shinjebeast: why is it that LINK looks more and more transgender from year to year
