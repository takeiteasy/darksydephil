[2017-03-09 22:11:11 UTC] yacherdy: Top level kek
[2017-03-09 22:11:35 UTC] hapticbabyman: @darthvidarviking I thought boy dysmorphia was more about constantly feeling your body is shit no matter how good it actually looks. A gender neutral kinda issue.
[2017-03-09 22:11:38 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I thought you're an elitist if you pay extra to play games early anon?
[2017-03-09 22:11:43 UTC] hapticbabyman: *body*
[2017-03-09 22:11:52 UTC] darthvidarviking: it's kind of the same
[2017-03-09 22:12:08 UTC] cplkevlar: I wish I was an elitist
[2017-03-09 22:12:21 UTC] anondublo1: @theycallmejimbob he probably does that too, getting to play games three days ahead like some e-sports legend

[2017-03-09 22:12:39 UTC] darthvidarviking: You think you are supposed to be a girl but is born a boy. IT is a mental issue. Not something you can cure with a knife, Cutting your genitals off only makes you a eunuch
[2017-03-09 22:12:43 UTC] cplkevlar: I'm only at the top 15% :( The other guys laugh at my meger 6 figure net worth

[2017-03-09 22:13:38 UTC] darthvidarviking: transgenderism and why it is linked to bodydysmorphia and a mental issue not a physical
[2017-03-09 22:13:38 UTC] hapticbabyman: @darthvidarviking It may not be a purely mental thing tho; it's possible for dudes to have too much estrogen for example, and that can affect testosterone levels
[2017-03-09 22:13:44 UTC] anondublo1: i'm in the bottom 1% and use your sales tax to feed my family via EBT

[2017-03-09 22:14:24 UTC] darthvidarviking: well some people thing they should be handicapped and want to cut their arms and legs off. That is insane, but when it is genitals it is suddenly normal. No give me a break

[2017-03-09 22:15:32 UTC] hapticbabyman: @darthvidarviking eh, it is what it is. But it may not be a purely mental thing. Some men have too much estrogen naturally, some women have too much testosterone naturally. That'd make it at least partially chemical/biological.
[2017-03-09 22:15:34 UTC] encelor: @cplkevlar in phil's bank account

[2017-03-09 22:18:51 UTC] hapticbabyman: @darthvidarviking most of the suicidal ones are usually super young tho, like under 15 and such I think. They obviously aren't old enough to make that decision, just like how they aren't old enough to consent to sex

[2017-03-09 22:21:10 UTC] hapticbabyman: @darthvidarviking I love being a dude, personally. but, if some guy wants to become a female, as long as they actually LOOK like a female when it's all said and done, and don't try to act like a guy when it's convenient for them, then I don't have a big issue with it. But I can understand why others may have an issue, I suppose.

[2017-03-09 22:40:27 UTC] bammbino: for those of you that are nintendo fans.. do you guys ACTUALLY enjoy puzzles in every single first party title from them??
[2017-03-09 22:40:32 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: people got angry that time
[2017-03-09 22:40:38 UTC] kinggoken: the puzzles are creative
[2017-03-09 22:40:41 UTC] myfellowjohnson: Porn can hurt your ability to become horny and get an erection when it's due time

[2017-03-09 22:42:59 UTC] hapticbabyman: @MosesAteMyBurrito But Nintendo and sometimes Sony hardcore fanboys are among the most obnoxious

[2017-03-09 22:44:23 UTC] bammbino: thats tough cause i consider myself a playstation fanboy but i dont press it on people
[2017-03-09 22:44:30 UTC] littlefootman: so no more story today?

[2017-03-09 22:44:41 UTC] kinggoken: the graphics remind me of wind waker
[2017-03-09 22:44:42 UTC] crbandic0ot: It's all side stuff
[2017-03-09 22:44:43 UTC] bammbino: sure, i WILL laugh/make fun of xbox one but we all know its well deserved
[2017-03-09 22:44:56 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Bammbino Dunno; my fave games are more like fighters and arcade-style platformers/action games, but a lot of Nintendo's stuff comes closer to those than some other devs out there. I think Platinum is underrated tho and Nintendo maybe kinda overrated at times.
[2017-03-09 22:44:59 UTC] kinggoken: dsp might do more story today
[2017-03-09 22:45:03 UTC] encelor: sora

[2017-03-09 22:47:08 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, i watch a certain podcast and one of the guys said "microsoft probably wants to jump into a new console generation, but if they do, wont be successful if they keep relying on halo and gears"
[2017-03-09 22:47:18 UTC] hapticbabyman: My main issue w/ Sony 1st party is most of them try to be like Hollywood movies, so they put story before gameplay. They're fun to play the first time or two but they don't hold out over extended repeat playthroughs
[2017-03-09 22:47:27 UTC] popsicolo: I hate when I run out of stamina at the peak KappaHD
[2017-03-09 22:47:30 UTC] popsicolo: Wait what
[2017-03-09 22:47:30 UTC] hapticbabyman: But they used to be really good w/ stuff like Parappa

[2017-03-09 22:48:12 UTC] kinggoken: I going to end up doing them last
[2017-03-09 22:48:15 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey DragonJarvis
[2017-03-09 22:48:18 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Bammbino They're right; those franchises are getting old, people want more than that for 1st party. So they better have some new IP cooking or bring back more of their abandoned ones.
[2017-03-09 22:48:23 UTC] bammbino: @hapticbabyman, replay value has never been a strong point with playstation exclusives.. we did it as kids cause we didnt have money for outselves

[2017-03-09 23:09:47 UTC] kill3rmandreams: @preciseradish The Wii U version typically loads faster, which is why people use it for speed runs
[2017-03-09 23:10:00 UTC] demonlord1993x: @preciseradish no switch still drops frames just in other location and a bit less frequent not worth 300 dollars dood
