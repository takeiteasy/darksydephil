[2017-03-04 00:00:02 UTC] annabac: hotels and restaurants same thing
[2017-03-04 00:00:10 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I wouldn't think so Royal_Phalanx91 they take into account your assets I presume having two places of residences would make you ineligible for payment I might be wrong with that.
[2017-03-04 00:00:23 UTC] bammbino: to a point yea, not fully covered but its not the big expense that people think it is
[2017-03-04 00:00:50 UTC] bodiebthewire: phil also tells people way to much personal info
[2017-03-04 00:01:01 UTC] phillkeked: do you guys know how much in debt he is like a ballpark number?
[2017-03-04 00:01:01 UTC] annabac: ^
[2017-03-04 00:01:06 UTC] bammbino: i never gave phil shit over the hotel vacations.. some people need an escape from their realitiy
[2017-03-04 00:01:14 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Tens of thousands I would think
[2017-03-04 00:01:17 UTC] larzionius: Like reading Text messages from Rambo
[2017-03-04 00:01:26 UTC] kingjadvcmp: he lives 45 minutes from Seattle yet spent over a thousand on the hotel there lol
[2017-03-04 00:01:35 UTC] annabac: thats fine, but where im from if you dont have money you cant take a vacation
[2017-03-04 00:01:36 UTC] bodiebthewire: problem is he did it right after he got all those views for his homefront vid
[2017-03-04 00:01:42 UTC] bammbino: @KingjadVCMP, tax write off here in amerca
[2017-03-04 00:02:02 UTC] larzionius: He had a chance on KOGaming and didn't take it
[2017-03-04 00:02:08 UTC] kingjadvcmp: big time
[2017-03-04 00:02:27 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I'm surprised he bought his house, I would have rented, but then again in the UK loads of young people rent because housing is expensive as fuck
[2017-03-04 00:02:52 UTC] kingjadvcmp: very true, I rent myself - saving up now actually with girlfriend, gonna buy one together in few years' time
[2017-03-04 00:02:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: What I don't understand was why he wasn't looking into a plan B before the rug got pulled from under him. He has been vlogging about a loss of income since October and struggling to pay his bills every month since.
[2017-03-04 00:02:58 UTC] larzionius: He moved pretty quickly. He should of waited and got his condo sold first
[2017-03-04 00:03:08 UTC] bammbino: i dont see the kogaming success guys, i dont.. his views were sky high for what his channels are about
[2017-03-04 00:03:28 UTC] kingjadvcmp: there is no plan B, Phil confirmed that long ago
[2017-03-04 00:03:31 UTC] bammbino: if you have the tme look at old reviews on dspgaming and kohvlogs.. views were good
[2017-03-04 00:03:44 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Likes were good too
[2017-03-04 00:03:47 UTC] larzionius: The 3 prong plan failed
[2017-03-04 00:03:48 UTC] bammbino: yep
[2017-03-04 00:04:10 UTC] bammbino: it may have "Failed" but we can atleast respect the fact that he tried something
[2017-03-04 00:04:19 UTC] royal_phalanx91: That was the time when phil got mostly positive comments
[2017-03-04 00:04:31 UTC] phillkeked: but it was really irresponsible of him not to have a plan b
[2017-03-04 00:04:37 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I asked this the other night to someone - do we think Phil has a 401K plan or whatever? Has he got savings for retirement that he may have to dip into as a last resort? Or is this everything he has?
[2017-03-04 00:04:39 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I didn't know that KingjadVCMP since today he was open to the possibility of getting a parttime job maybe he might of found something ideal for him if he had to start in Oct.
[2017-03-04 00:05:11 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He's making a big deal of the car issue, again, Leanna could drive him to work when she goes to work
[2017-03-04 00:05:26 UTC] kingjadvcmp: she works in retail yeah? might be odd hours
[2017-03-04 00:05:38 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: he won't get a manual job, very unlikely
[2017-03-04 00:05:51 UTC] jordanlolss: Public transportation is a thing, I know it's not preferrable, but it's still an option
[2017-03-04 00:05:57 UTC] bigmanbigdallnightlong: what ?
[2017-03-04 00:06:09 UTC] bammbino: @KingjadVCMP, without him telling us the details.. its pretty much all he has
[2017-03-04 00:06:20 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he ruled that out Jordanlolss he said the bus service was unreliable and he had to have a car
[2017-03-04 00:06:20 UTC] larzionius: I've noticed he looks very pale lately
[2017-03-04 00:06:28 UTC] annabac: when he is forced to work again he'll make it work, he has to or he would be fucked there also
[2017-03-04 00:06:37 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil is pale cos he's rarely out
[2017-03-04 00:06:40 UTC] bammbino: when he lived in CT, he bought all collector editions and outright bought statues just to have them and ordered food ALL the time
[2017-03-04 00:06:51 UTC] bigmanbigdallnightlong: DSP has a job its his youtube
[2017-03-04 00:07:02 UTC] annabac: if he has to quit**
[2017-03-04 00:07:12 UTC] larzionius: and this short sell is R.I.P to his credit
[2017-03-04 00:07:16 UTC] bammbino: KingjadVCMP, he stopped buying all that stuff but the same funds would now cover his housing costs
[2017-03-04 00:07:47 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Back then he had the money, now he doesn't
[2017-03-04 00:07:55 UTC] ambervisage: bammbino brings up a good point, he would always rush to get the most pricey version of a game
[2017-03-04 00:08:08 UTC] kingjadvcmp: living within your means is vital. Honestly, if you can figure that out that's the hardest part.
[2017-03-04 00:08:11 UTC] bammbino: well a good amount of the release day unboxing covered it
[2017-03-04 00:08:28 UTC] bammbino: so this goes right back to what i brought up earlier
[2017-03-04 00:08:35 UTC] larzionius: @Bammbino not to mention sometimes he would buy 6 games at a time
[2017-03-04 00:08:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the PSVR doesn't seem like a good investment in hindsight he said it cost him 1k including games, it is gathering some dust now
[2017-03-04 00:08:38 UTC] ambervisage: "i got the collectors edition there, got the ultimate edition that"
[2017-03-04 00:08:54 UTC] jordanlolss: Personally, I think either way Phil will need to change something. Uploading full, unedited game play throughs on YouTube just isn't something people are interested in anymore. He gained a core following and then plateaued. He can either a) focus on Youtube, get a new partnership, and begin uploading edited videos... or b) stream full time but become more interactive with chat, not focusing on completing full games, but focusing on creating enjoyable and entertaining content.
[2017-03-04 00:08:58 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He should have cancelled the switch preorder
[2017-03-04 00:08:59 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well I asked Phil about the PSVR before, he said he effectively broke even with the videos he made about it
[2017-03-04 00:09:05 UTC] annabac: if you get the views , why not , but he doesnt
[2017-03-04 00:09:30 UTC] bammbino: if phil stops shiting on game developers and he becomes a fair guy in the online world that they'd be willing to send him games for FREE/early.. he can do an unboxinb (no cost to him, only profit) and play the game and review them.. again profit, no expense
[2017-03-04 00:09:49 UTC] phillkeked: @jordanloss my toughts, i think he should go the stream route personally, make this community more like a community
[2017-03-04 00:09:51 UTC] bammbino: remember the COD fiasco? im not playing it but he played it cause a fan donated it?
[2017-03-04 00:09:57 UTC] ambervisage: can he still call out the truly bullshit in a game?
[2017-03-04 00:10:13 UTC] larzionius: Then the 4k tv he wants
[2017-03-04 00:10:34 UTC] kingjadvcmp: nobody is asking Phil to not be honest, they're just asking him to man up and stop blaming others for his own fuck-ups, whether it's in life or a video game
[2017-03-04 00:10:40 UTC] bammbino: @AmberVisage, game devs dont have issues with you criticizing the game and/or its faults.. you dont openly insult them in 2/3 of the videos lol
[2017-03-04 00:10:55 UTC] awesomebeard: unboxings aren't as popular anymore and bigger youtubers get stuff like consoles etc for free waaaay earlier than phil does for review purposes so no matter how early he buys something he can get something at 12 at night go home make a video right away and upload it and there will be already plenty of video's up of the exact same thing days before
[2017-03-04 00:10:57 UTC] ambervisage: i mean shitting on game developers is fine when its justified for?
[2017-03-04 00:11:17 UTC] annabac: it is, like no mans sky
[2017-03-04 00:11:22 UTC] kingjadvcmp: pop quiz, anyone remember the last time Phil made a mistake in a video, and admitted he fucked up massively about it, owned the mistake?
[2017-03-04 00:11:24 UTC] bammbino: earlier in nioh " amazing frame rate and controls are so good" towards the end "bullshit fucking devs and their garbage controls" THAT is the issue AmberVisage
[2017-03-04 00:11:24 UTC] phillkeked: i believe if you are a reviewer you are justified saying a game is shit if its shit lol
[2017-03-04 00:11:28 UTC] jordanlolss: I don't think Phil really enjoys spending time editing videos, which is why I think he'd be better off trying streaming full time. Phil has the personality, and is entertaining. That's why he still has a core audience. It's because we enjoy HIM, not that he plays EVERY single AAA game that comes out. Personally, I unsubbed from DSPGaming b/c he was uploading like 10 videos a day and clogging up my sub box. I still watch all of his vlog videos b/c I enjoy him as an entertainer.
[2017-03-04 00:11:33 UTC] annabac: but the silly excuses when he fails in a mp annoys me
[2017-03-04 00:11:38 UTC] ambervisage: yeah well rage does that to you.
[2017-03-04 00:11:46 UTC] awesomebeard: its fine when its justified like with no mans sky but phil does it with almost every developer even top tier like from software calling the morons etc
[2017-03-04 00:11:49 UTC] annabac: yup but people will give you shit for it
[2017-03-04 00:12:04 UTC] theycallmejimbob: KingjadVCMP, I do remember a rare occasion on Nioh when he said something was his fault :P
[2017-03-04 00:12:08 UTC] ambervisage: how many times did Phil say the game is garbage and in the end or his review he was like "Great game overall"
[2017-03-04 00:12:16 UTC] phillkeked: man phill does it when he gets salty XD
[2017-03-04 00:12:26 UTC] bammbino: is phil really the problem with the sub box filling up? or is it youtube for not having a sytem in place for us viewers to manage shit?
[2017-03-04 00:12:36 UTC] kingjadvcmp: but that just highlights his hypocrisy, AmberVisage - what Phil do we believe?
[2017-03-04 00:12:53 UTC] bigmanbigdallnightlong: what is going with phil
[2017-03-04 00:12:54 UTC] zahvone: Well you can turn off notifications
[2017-03-04 00:13:04 UTC] bammbino: its like greg and colin from ign.. they made kindafunny and i dont fucking care for their content other than the playstation podcast.. youtube doesnt let me follow just the podcast
[2017-03-04 00:13:13 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Wow Phil just tweeted"Just applied to a network that says there are 1k people in front of me and it would take weeks to be reviewed for approval. Um, nope lol" wow competition is fierce
[2017-03-04 00:13:17 UTC] ambervisage: like i have been playing league almost my entire life, which is why i have missed out on so many games (im trying to catch up and part of the reason i found Phil is that) and i still call that game a piece of shit only because of how time consuming and cancerous the community is while truth is i love the game to pieces
[2017-03-04 00:13:31 UTC] kingjadvcmp: yeah everyone wants to be next PDP or KSI
[2017-03-04 00:14:00 UTC] zahvone: Well, I mean you CAN turn off notifications for Youtubers, or alternatively just block the notifications lol
[2017-03-04 00:14:15 UTC] annabac: i think like multiplayer games like overwatch and call of duty he makes excuses why he dies
[2017-03-04 00:14:22 UTC] awesomebeard: @Bammbino kinda both youtube should have some system to cope with that shit but if you are a youtuber you live and die by the rules of youtube and how the systems are no exceptions and you need to adapt how youtube works with every change and thats the problem with phil instead of adapting to the changes over the years he just blames youtube for not being compatible with his way of work
[2017-03-04 00:14:27 UTC] annabac: rage and shit is fine, but own up to it and try to get better
[2017-03-04 00:14:29 UTC] bammbino: @Zahvone, its not about the notifications.. its about how messy tyoutube is
[2017-03-04 00:14:30 UTC] ambervisage: its not hypocrisity tho is it? if u just have a "rageful" moment in a game and call it shit cause its annoying u it doesnt mean u dont like the game
[2017-03-04 00:14:32 UTC] jordanlolss: @Bammbino, No, Phil isn't the problem with that at all. Regardless, it's still an issue with YouTube. People don't like their sub box being filled with 10 videos by one person. Again, that's not something Phil can help, but it's something that every content creator has to keep in mind when creating an uploading schedule.
[2017-03-04 00:14:54 UTC] annabac: im not talking about shit talking a game, more the commentary he is putting up
[2017-03-04 00:14:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: For anyone that missed the earlier vlog it has gone live on his vlogging channel
[2017-03-04 00:15:16 UTC] annabac: this is bs, i was around the corner w/e, lag!!
[2017-03-04 00:15:17 UTC] zahvone: Everyone gets mad at video games and blames something other than themselves lol. Unless you're a Dark Souls player
[2017-03-04 00:15:34 UTC] kingjadvcmp: personally, I used to be like Phil when I played FIFA. I raged a lot and blamed EA. Lot of anger. But truth of the matter is...nah, fuck it, it was EA lol. Seriously, I fucked up a fair bit but just lashed out at EA for their game, and while I had some merit I failed to accept the blame back then
[2017-03-04 00:15:57 UTC] annabac: right but in rage he insults like his fans playing him
[2017-03-04 00:16:13 UTC] kingjadvcmp: today, I can play FIFA and can admit I absolutely suck at it
[2017-03-04 00:16:28 UTC] bammbino: i was here when gino and bethe were talking about leanna saying shit was pregnant with morning sickness and overall being nasty
[2017-03-04 00:16:39 UTC] bammbino: phil was strugging in game and called everyone idiots
[2017-03-04 00:16:42 UTC] bammbino: when it was 2 people
[2017-03-04 00:16:49 UTC] bammbino: anger management is needed
[2017-03-04 00:17:00 UTC] ambervisage: someone mentioned that everyone wants to be the next PDP, man i swear down, i wish i could be the next DSP, only like, more successful and without all the drama with the detractors
[2017-03-04 00:17:30 UTC] annabac: try it
[2017-03-04 00:17:33 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yeah AmberVisage people would be over the moon to get his stream attendance tbh
[2017-03-04 00:17:36 UTC] ambervisage: and what i mean by more like DSP is the raw unedited gameplay, focusing mostly on the game.
[2017-03-04 00:17:44 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I would not want to be the next DSP. This is how you don't YouTube? He's made a lot of mistakes. You want to adhere to his ethos, his mindset of approaching games, fair enough, power to you
[2017-03-04 00:17:55 UTC] bammbino: AmberVisage, til this day i firmly think that phil made his haters.. no one knew what would happen when you insult kojima and and mgs.. phil was first to find out
[2017-03-04 00:18:14 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Phil needs to stop shitting on other Youtubers. Just don't talk about them. This is why Phil has a bad rep on YT
[2017-03-04 00:18:19 UTC] annabac: oh boy xD
[2017-03-04 00:18:23 UTC] jordanlolss: @Bammbino, Well, I think one of the main reasons why Phil has amassed such a huge troll following is because of how he reacts. I think that he is way better at dealing with it nowadays, but he kind of provoked it years back when he would get super angry and throws insults every which way at anyone who trolled him
[2017-03-04 00:18:26 UTC] annabac: that also
[2017-03-04 00:18:29 UTC] annabac: its so uncalled for
[2017-03-04 00:18:38 UTC] ambervisage: well for once i applaud Phil not giving a shit about all the Kojima dickriders at that point
[2017-03-04 00:18:46 UTC] kingjadvcmp: "I don't have time to watch other YouTubers" (proceeds to talk shit about what other YouTubers are supposedly doing all the time)
[2017-03-04 00:18:57 UTC] bammbino: same but i damn well dont give kojima fanboys attention lol
[2017-03-04 00:19:00 UTC] annabac: its his ego
[2017-03-04 00:19:10 UTC] ambervisage: licking Kojima's butthole so hard like he was their savior or some shit
[2017-03-04 00:19:32 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Phil has a hard time saying "I'm sorry for everything" and admitting he was wrong
[2017-03-04 00:19:59 UTC] bammbino: til this day, people are STILL butthurt of what leana said about kingdom heart fans.. its so sad to see people caught up in what a random girl said on a stream
[2017-03-04 00:19:59 UTC] ambervisage: i feel like people are not making it easy for him
[2017-03-04 00:20:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I was actually pleasantly surprised he somewhat apologised for his previous mistakes today Royal_Phalanx91
[2017-03-04 00:20:18 UTC] annabac: they arent
[2017-03-04 00:20:29 UTC] bammbino: you sure? cause trhey are getting banned every stream
[2017-03-04 00:20:34 UTC] annabac: its really annoying to see the yt comments and dislikes
[2017-03-04 00:20:39 UTC] bammbino: its almost a copy pasta these days
[2017-03-04 00:20:41 UTC] ambervisage: "going to apologize to all those trolls that hate on me daily and insult me, make livestreams solely for me, flooding my videos with dislikes, nasty comments about me, my family.
[2017-03-04 00:21:10 UTC] bammbino: he said sorry to them too many times
[2017-03-04 00:21:16 UTC] bammbino: it doesnt change shit
[2017-03-04 00:21:27 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil is not sorry, though
[2017-03-04 00:21:39 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I think he said before he could of handled the emergence of the TIHYDP montages better
[2017-03-04 00:21:58 UTC] bammbino: League of Legends, a game that has nothing to do with phil for ANY reason.. has people mocking him with their name
[2017-03-04 00:22:12 UTC] bammbino: i met a group of 4 haters on my team.. like wow of all the people i get
[2017-03-04 00:22:18 UTC] ambervisage: LOL
[2017-03-04 00:22:33 UTC] bammbino: no matter what he does or says, they grow like roaches
[2017-03-04 00:22:47 UTC] crazed_connovore: SUO
[2017-03-04 00:22:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: why do you think that KingjadVCMP ?
[2017-03-04 00:22:52 UTC] ambervisage: "But Visage, why did u stop playing League man? You've been playing since season 1" Gee, i dont know?!?!?
[2017-03-04 00:22:52 UTC] bammbino: 1 will turn into a fan in the YT comments, another will take its place
[2017-03-04 00:23:25 UTC] bammbino: i got my main account perma'd on purpose last year lol
[2017-03-04 00:23:32 UTC] bammbino: fuck dynamic queue
[2017-03-04 00:23:56 UTC] ambervisage: i should have done the same but my mind is still trying to trick me into playing
[2017-03-04 00:24:34 UTC] bammbino: i do regret it and wish i was strong enough to stop playing til they removed it
[2017-03-04 00:24:43 UTC] bammbino: but i was addicted and couldnt stand premades
[2017-03-04 00:24:52 UTC] bammbino: so i ran it down mid
[2017-03-04 00:26:13 UTC] ambervisage: i regret losing out on so many games in the past, games like the last of us, bioshock franchise, uncharted games, sly games, L.A noire, gta 5, red dead redemption and the list never ends
[2017-03-04 00:26:47 UTC] ambervisage: people play all the hot releases and im literally buying ALL the games i missed out and play them while watching Phil's old playthroughs lmao
[2017-03-04 00:26:50 UTC] annabac: be glad, you can still play em for a cheaper price then when they got out
[2017-03-04 00:27:20 UTC] ambervisage: yeah but money wasnt an issue, i just wish i could play them when all the hype around them was hot
[2017-03-04 00:29:14 UTC] annabac: well who knows, phil might be around for a long time still
[2017-03-04 00:29:32 UTC] annabac: time will tell, and you can enjoy the games then
[2017-03-04 00:31:59 UTC] phillkeked: tbh playing a game when its hot doesnt make that much of a difference i played re7 when it was hot and sotn 10+ years after realease and sotn was more enjoyable for me
[2017-03-04 00:33:50 UTC] annabac: ^ the formula from most tripple A games are the same nowadays in a new skin
[2017-03-04 00:35:30 UTC] ambervisage: its not the enjoyable part that is lacking, but like all the discussion about a game that a lot of people are playing atm and you being able to partake in that conversation is awesome
[2017-03-04 00:39:55 UTC] phillkeked: yeah being there for the start of a games community is enjoyable
[2017-03-04 01:00:22 UTC] darksydephil: Test
[2017-03-04 01:00:34 UTC] darksydephil: Testing
[2017-03-04 01:01:09 UTC] darksydephil: Can anyone see this?
[2017-03-04 01:01:11 UTC] zahvone: Ayyy
[2017-03-04 01:01:26 UTC] annabac: yes sir
[2017-03-04 01:01:29 UTC] zardmander: haHAA
[2017-03-04 01:01:44 UTC] darksydephil: Ok cool im on my phone so its a bit wonky
[2017-03-04 01:02:03 UTC] zahvone: Yeah Phil, whatsup man? I literally haven't left since the stream, lol.
[2017-03-04 01:02:30 UTC] darksydephil: Well im thinking about stuff more while i wait for my switch to arrive
[2017-03-04 01:03:05 UTC] zahvone: You're going to stress yourself to death. Go outside and let the smell of weed relax you on the way to subway or something lmao
[2017-03-04 01:03:21 UTC] annabac: the wait is real ^^
[2017-03-04 01:03:30 UTC] darksydephil: Almost thinking at this point that i could do my gaming exclusively on twitch but then use youtube for vlogging only since the gaming thing isnt working there anymore
[2017-03-04 01:04:18 UTC] darksydephil: Im having serious doubts about getting DSPGaming partnered again
[2017-03-04 01:04:35 UTC] jdomican: Hey Phil, I've been watching for years
[2017-03-04 01:04:36 UTC] annabac: you can try it, see how it goes, how it works understand twitch community and grow from there
[2017-03-04 01:04:45 UTC] alexander_rossi: vlogging about politics/news/current events is a lot more lucrative to watch then just talking about movies like you used to vlog about. I really only clicked on the news related vlogs
[2017-03-04 01:04:52 UTC] zahvone: Well, I mean you really could just try streaming as much as you can. If you ever did decide to do edits or something, I would even look into letting fans make funniest moment montages and uploading them to the channel.
[2017-03-04 01:04:59 UTC] cainmasters: When's Zelda blud??
[2017-03-04 01:05:24 UTC] jdomican: I hope it works out for you, I've always rooted for you even though I don't comment much
[2017-03-04 01:05:31 UTC] cainmasters: Waiting to watch Phil play it don't wanna see anyone else play it
[2017-03-04 01:05:31 UTC] zahvone: Same.
[2017-03-04 01:05:43 UTC] darksydephil: If i streamed here all the time and then focused on reaction vlogs, news stories and more maybe the balance could work, but id have to figure out how to make way more here on twitch for sure
[2017-03-04 01:05:57 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: watching the video now, yeah fuck machima, who the fuck still partners with them in 2017
[2017-03-04 01:06:21 UTC] zahvone: Well, Phil have you thought about trying to get sponsored by a company? Other I know you'd get a lot of shit for it but - I mean literally everyone does it if they can.
[2017-03-04 01:06:27 UTC] cainmasters: Fuck Mach fuck YouTube fuck the haters
[2017-03-04 01:06:29 UTC] darksydephil: I dont even know if machinima accepts new partners anymore lol
[2017-03-04 01:06:52 UTC] yuichimccry: whats changed?
[2017-03-04 01:06:57 UTC] faisalking11: probably not
[2017-03-04 01:07:07 UTC] cainmasters: How long till Zelda my g? @darksydephil
[2017-03-04 01:07:28 UTC] darksydephil: The switch has to arrive first for me to do anything with it, lol
[2017-03-04 01:07:45 UTC] cainmasters: They're taking long innit?
[2017-03-04 01:07:46 UTC] zahvone: Can't you just cut the sides off of the wii u and stream that? Lol
[2017-03-04 01:08:15 UTC] alexander_rossi: should've pre-ordered from gamestop cmonBruh
[2017-03-04 01:08:28 UTC] annabac: its all in the subs and bits, but you have to earn them, be entertaining, interact with chat, if it goes well, you will see subs all day, itll be hard to see the haters all day in the chat hope thats over soon
[2017-03-04 01:08:32 UTC] cainmasters: You're godlike at ST @darksydephil
[2017-03-04 01:08:58 UTC] zahvone: Just remember that getting a viewership on this platform is going to take a little bit of time.
[2017-03-04 01:09:07 UTC] darksydephil: Annabac do you watch any full-time streamers?
[2017-03-04 01:09:14 UTC] annabac: right and yes
[2017-03-04 01:09:23 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, hey i am a really long time fan of your full playthroughs and i think it needs to continue but in order to be good on twitch, i seriously think you need to stop shitting on game devs and viewers(both fans and haters) i pretty much live my life on this website watching people and know how they are successful
[2017-03-04 01:09:25 UTC] darksydephil: Ok cool
[2017-03-04 01:09:27 UTC] faisalking11: I do to
[2017-03-04 01:09:37 UTC] annabac: i know a good 2 for example, there main base is from destiny
[2017-03-04 01:09:44 UTC] annabac: but play a lot of big
[2017-03-04 01:09:47 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, not shitting on thegame devs will get you early/free copies of the game which translate to profit
[2017-03-04 01:09:48 UTC] annabac: other games also on release
[2017-03-04 01:10:08 UTC] darksydephil: So how typically would they interact with tbe stream exactly?
[2017-03-04 01:10:13 UTC] cainmasters: You're good money Phil don't worry fam. Someone will be happy to sign you up
[2017-03-04 01:10:23 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, being nice and getting to know people in chat from time to time is how they get subs
[2017-03-04 01:10:41 UTC] zahvone: Generally speaking they look at the chat and answer questions they might get. Other than that it's really just talking about literally anything until a notification comes up on stream.
[2017-03-04 01:10:45 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: Why do I feel like machima withhold a lot of the youtube ad earnings, and just looking out for themselves
[2017-03-04 01:10:58 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, i followed lirik and towelliee since justin . tv and they have had nothing but success with being positive to their fans
[2017-03-04 01:11:03 UTC] bammbino: both have 10k + subs
[2017-03-04 01:11:04 UTC] annabac: they will read some good questions about the game, answer them, answer questions about things in life while playing
[2017-03-04 01:11:21 UTC] alexander_rossi: you're kind of in a tough spot because you said for tax purposes you don't accept paypal donations. Streamers I watch are like 75% paypal, 25% bits in terms of support
[2017-03-04 01:11:37 UTC] annabac: have subs notice, and bit notice
[2017-03-04 01:11:50 UTC] annabac: and thanking them briefly for it
[2017-03-04 01:11:58 UTC] zahvone: @DarksydePhil If you ever have downtime I would also highly recommend playing games with subscribers or viewers as much as possible.
[2017-03-04 01:11:59 UTC] radicaldreamer1: my only suggestion for you to get better on twitch would be by using similar scripts like most twitchstreamers do - I'm sure theres some kind of a database for that stuff
[2017-03-04 01:12:03 UTC] cainmasters: You already built a big platform. You got a lot of eyes that watch your stuff. Companies will want to put their stuff next to your stuff trust me
[2017-03-04 01:12:23 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, Sodapoppin accidentally leaked that he got 262k from donations lol not counting the 10k+ subs per month and bits
[2017-03-04 01:12:33 UTC] bammbino: just from 2016
[2017-03-04 01:12:43 UTC] sasuke2745: dsp gone?
[2017-03-04 01:12:44 UTC] annabac: if you want you could check and see as example how they do it
[2017-03-04 01:12:52 UTC] cainmasters: People make mad doe from twitch still
[2017-03-04 01:13:11 UTC] bammbino: yep Cainmasters they dont even have debt now with big houses
[2017-03-04 01:13:14 UTC] darksydephil: So it really is all about the donations? That's surprising
[2017-03-04 01:13:22 UTC] bammbino: not just donations
[2017-03-04 01:13:31 UTC] bammbino: the subs are the donators
[2017-03-04 01:13:42 UTC] cainmasters: Subs is the ting
[2017-03-04 01:13:53 UTC] bammbino: i.e lets say Annabac loves you so much that he subs and donates $500 to you
[2017-03-04 01:14:00 UTC] bammbino: hes the big donator this month
[2017-03-04 01:14:00 UTC] annabac: donations could come on screen with message for few secs etc
[2017-03-04 01:14:00 UTC] zahvone: Think of Twitch.tv as a Cabaret club, Phil
[2017-03-04 01:14:00 UTC] nightbot: Zahvone -> I kill bugs...DEAD! [stop posting links] [warning]
[2017-03-04 01:14:13 UTC] cainmasters: 1000 subs is a wage
[2017-03-04 01:14:14 UTC] bammbino: Cainmasters, may be that other sub that joins in with $600
[2017-03-04 01:14:25 UTC] icureditwithmybrain: I recently saw a twitch streamer receive $1,500 in 30 minutes of streaming.
[2017-03-04 01:14:35 UTC] zahvone: Think of Twitch (I typed the twitch url, sorry) as a Cabaret club, Phil
[2017-03-04 01:14:50 UTC] bammbino: Mrhappy1227 made his incom off of youtube and is pretty much giving up on it as twitch has TRIPLED that income
[2017-03-04 01:14:51 UTC] alexander_rossi: having a dedicated group of people that regularly donate and support you is just as viable as being huge. a guy I watch on twitch (broughy1322) has less followers than you on twitch and less youtube subs, yet he makes as much money from twitch as people with 100k+ followers because he has such a passionate, dedicated group of supporters
[2017-03-04 01:15:02 UTC] darksydephil: What happens when people donate? On-screen popups? How does it factor into the stream?
[2017-03-04 01:15:10 UTC] sasuke2745: o hai phil =)
[2017-03-04 01:15:19 UTC] hippostabber: you just say thxs and move on
[2017-03-04 01:15:23 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: example of fun donation stream is Maximilian Dood
[2017-03-04 01:15:32 UTC] zahvone: So, you can look into things like Muxy, or streamlabs. You'll have donation notifications that show up, you can customize every aspect of it.
[2017-03-04 01:15:51 UTC] annabac: people like to be noticed or have influence , it pops up, and the streamer will say, Hey thanks for the donation, you are awesome! and move on or just thanks ''name'' for the donation
[2017-03-04 01:15:55 UTC] darksydephil: I have streamlabs but its kind of wonky
[2017-03-04 01:15:57 UTC] alexander_rossi: you can set it so that they can accompany text with their donation to show on stream as well purpleCx
[2017-03-04 01:16:03 UTC] jdomican: Some have text to speech setup that reads the donations out loud lol
[2017-03-04 01:16:04 UTC] darksydephil: Sometjmes it doesnt work properly
[2017-03-04 01:16:06 UTC] bammbino: DarksydePhil, well man sucks to say it but you're in a really fucked up part of this online world since haters will abuse you via donations -- you need to figure out how to filter ANY and ALL forms of hate and racism
[2017-03-04 01:16:11 UTC] cainmasters: Just be you Phil I swear it'll work lol
[2017-03-04 01:16:13 UTC] annabac: dont do text to speach
[2017-03-04 01:16:28 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, iceposeidon got banned for 1 month cause someone donated the nword on stream
[2017-03-04 01:16:44 UTC] icureditwithmybrain: @annabac lol
[2017-03-04 01:16:50 UTC] cainmasters: People will donate just to hate on you it's maaad funny lol
[2017-03-04 01:16:57 UTC] zahvone: Try to think about Twitch as playing with friends and shit talking each other instead of it being a business, if you can. I mean really the less you stress about it the happier you'll be? I know it's easy said than done but you really should try it.
[2017-03-04 01:17:11 UTC] radicaldreamer1: yeah give it a shot
[2017-03-04 01:17:11 UTC] darksydephil: Well obviously you shouldnt let racist words be said, you can set up banned words and the like
[2017-03-04 01:17:13 UTC] annabac: but it's about creating an envirment people want to be in, enjoy the game, enjoy interaction with chat, and try to create your place on twitch
[2017-03-04 01:17:24 UTC] alexander_rossi: speaking of ice poseidon, he's literally walking around los angeles on stream right now and making thousands of dollars in donations just by being entertaining
[2017-03-04 01:17:38 UTC] annabac: yeah but speaking donations is cancer people will find ways to bypass censor
[2017-03-04 01:17:53 UTC] darksydephil: I wouldnt do speaking donations lol
[2017-03-04 01:18:07 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, lirk(biggest streamer) uses stream labs for donations but you have to be clear and not use "donations" you have to call it "Tips"
[2017-03-04 01:18:17 UTC] yuichimccry: can someone catch me up real quick on everything?
[2017-03-04 01:18:18 UTC] zahvone: don't do that, for sure. If I were you Phil? I would have the donations show up on stream though - and after maybe 15-30 minutes or so, thank those people
[2017-03-04 01:18:21 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: its not even about the gameplay content anymore for big twitch streamers, is about the streamer being entertaining and interacting with the chat
[2017-03-04 01:18:23 UTC] cainmasters: Still play street fighter? @darksydephil
[2017-03-04 01:18:24 UTC] hippostabber: you have to find balance between the game and interaction with the fans
[2017-03-04 01:18:39 UTC] bammbino: towelliee, lirik and so many more used to get fucked with taxes calling it donations.. something with them being tips wont fuck you with the irs
[2017-03-04 01:19:15 UTC] alexander_rossi: i recommend checking out ice poseidon to see how he works the chat, its like an art form tbh purpleW
[2017-03-04 01:19:33 UTC] bammbino: they also get in direct contacts with game development companies and get keys for their games cause they dont bash the studio, they only talk about the game
[2017-03-04 01:19:35 UTC] annabac: as someone wih a following you could ask some streamers to help you set up , explain some standard stuff, think some are more than willing to help
[2017-03-04 01:19:54 UTC] royal_phalanx91: problem is his rep
[2017-03-04 01:19:57 UTC] hippostabber: i suggest checking at grand poobear
[2017-03-04 01:20:03 UTC] zahvone: Reputation can always be fixed.
[2017-03-04 01:20:03 UTC] darksydephil: Tips not donations. Hmm. Yes my accountant specifically told me not to take "donations" bc of the irs
[2017-03-04 01:20:08 UTC] cainmasters: Fuck dem fake guys man. I don't like them. Just keep it real like you always done Phil
[2017-03-04 01:20:11 UTC] bammbino: nope not his rep they want money and publicitiy
[2017-03-04 01:20:21 UTC] annabac: doesnt matter, there are a lot who dont care about that, they deal with good bad rep themselfs
[2017-03-04 01:20:36 UTC] annabac: it isnt called donation but
[2017-03-04 01:20:38 UTC] zahvone: Hey can you take the chat out of slow mode? There isn't many people here.
[2017-03-04 01:20:44 UTC] yawgmoth0: Phil, do you think its funny you kept making fun of twitch streamers asking for donations and pausing game play to talk with chat. Yet, you will be doing the same exact thing shortly.
[2017-03-04 01:20:50 UTC] bammbino: doesnt matter what phil said in the past, if he changes and criticizes the games and not the people that make them he WILL get copies of games for free (not all, but will get games)
[2017-03-04 01:21:14 UTC] zahvone: Oh my god I made it worse. LOL
[2017-03-04 01:21:23 UTC] cainmasters: Don't wanna see Phil turn into one of these wacky fake streamers who don't even know how to play a game
[2017-03-04 01:21:27 UTC] darksydephil: I cant turn off slow mode on my phone lolol
[2017-03-04 01:21:37 UTC] bestkill100: TheIlluminati
[2017-03-04 01:21:38 UTC] royal_phalanx91: get on the pc :P
[2017-03-04 01:21:48 UTC] darksydephil: Give me a sec, ill run to the office to fix it
[2017-03-04 01:22:09 UTC] zahvone: Jesus that was quick.
[2017-03-04 01:22:12 UTC] abortionpill: "run to the office" lel
[2017-03-04 01:22:13 UTC] bammbino: @Cainmasters, thats not what im trying to get here.. phil needs to be in a spot where he no longer has to pay for every game, and he should be able to get games earlier
[2017-03-04 01:22:20 UTC] faisalking11: he ran lol
[2017-03-04 01:22:24 UTC] darksydephil: oh
[2017-03-04 01:22:29 UTC] darksydephil: its off now?
[2017-03-04 01:22:31 UTC] zahvone: Yes
[2017-03-04 01:22:32 UTC] darksydephil: who turned it off?
[2017-03-04 01:22:33 UTC] darksydephil: lol
[2017-03-04 01:22:34 UTC] cainmasters: He can get that easy I think
[2017-03-04 01:22:36 UTC] darksydephil: it wasn't me i just got here
[2017-03-04 01:22:36 UTC] icureditwithmybrain: I turned it off
[2017-03-04 01:22:47 UTC] darksydephil: oh okay!
[2017-03-04 01:22:47 UTC] zahvone: What I think you need Phil - you need some way to get a sponsorship.
[2017-03-04 01:22:48 UTC] cainmasters: Hit capcom up or something
[2017-03-04 01:22:49 UTC] bammbino: @Cainmasters, for example.. alot of us hated waiting for the horizon zero dawn stream on tuesday when everyone had it from the devs on sunday/monday
[2017-03-04 01:22:50 UTC] darksydephil: thanks Icureditwithmybrain
[2017-03-04 01:22:51 UTC] darksydephil: lol
[2017-03-04 01:22:56 UTC] radicaldreamer1: yea thats better :)
[2017-03-04 01:23:05 UTC] icureditwithmybrain: I had to google the command because I forgot it
[2017-03-04 01:23:10 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I'm freeeeeee SwiftRage damn you slow mode SwiftRage
[2017-03-04 01:23:12 UTC] hippostabber: maybe try a game you have played before when you try to interact may make it easyier
[2017-03-04 01:23:19 UTC] cainmasters: Yea like now I wish Phil had a switch and Zelda
[2017-03-04 01:23:26 UTC] bammbino: exactly
[2017-03-04 01:23:26 UTC] annabac: i'd have to look up, but they are not donations, but gifts or something, some other streamers lawyer told him to say it's '' gifts or w/e'' would have to look it up
[2017-03-04 01:23:37 UTC] zahvone: You need some kind of drink sponsor. If you're using a webcam in your stream it'd be a smart play. Mostly because you drink on stream a lot, and it just makes sense.
[2017-03-04 01:23:39 UTC] faisalking11: play silent hill here you will get lots of people
[2017-03-04 01:23:41 UTC] sasuke2745: phil needs that switch
[2017-03-04 01:23:45 UTC] annabac: tips maybe
[2017-03-04 01:24:05 UTC] darksydephil: Ok back
[2017-03-04 01:24:06 UTC] bammbino: a DIVISION game youtuber got the switch and zelda for FREE from nintendo lol.. no holds barred, he can say w/e about the game
[2017-03-04 01:24:15 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: all donations are income so they are taxed
[2017-03-04 01:24:25 UTC] cainmasters: How much followers you got on twitter phil?
[2017-03-04 01:24:26 UTC] jonsnow23456: Isn't Zelda on WIIU as well ?
[2017-03-04 01:24:30 UTC] annabac: thats why they are called something else
[2017-03-04 01:24:33 UTC] sasuke2745: it is
[2017-03-04 01:24:37 UTC] sasuke2745: zelda is on wii u
[2017-03-04 01:24:52 UTC] darksydephil: So let me see if i get the gist of full time streaming
[2017-03-04 01:25:02 UTC] jonsnow23456: I thought Phil had ordered the Switch
[2017-03-04 01:25:03 UTC] radicaldreamer1: yeah silent hill 2 HD would be cool :P
[2017-03-04 01:25:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: MGS redemption run would be cool too
[2017-03-04 01:25:23 UTC] sasuke2745: mgs 3 =)
[2017-03-04 01:25:24 UTC] zahvone: I've got to say this though, Phil. I really have been watching your stuff for, forever man. Literally 7+ years. I don't know if it's the gameplay, or your reactions and comedy but you definitely have something.
[2017-03-04 01:25:25 UTC] faisalking11: do it phil !! play silent hill 2
[2017-03-04 01:25:29 UTC] darksydephil: More interaction, talking eith stream chat, having notifications for subs/bits/tips
[2017-03-04 01:25:31 UTC] sasuke2745: id watch a mgs runthrew
[2017-03-04 01:25:46 UTC] zahvone: It's mostly about stroking your streamchat's e-peens
[2017-03-04 01:25:48 UTC] darksydephil: Making it social like hanging with friends, and being positive
[2017-03-04 01:25:50 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you're right Sasuke2745 MGS 3 would be fun
[2017-03-04 01:25:51 UTC] radicaldreamer1: Kreygasm sounds like a plan
[2017-03-04 01:25:51 UTC] zahvone: Exactly.
[2017-03-04 01:25:54 UTC] bammbino: EXACTLY
[2017-03-04 01:25:54 UTC] annabac: enjoy the game you are playing, the envirement is important
[2017-03-04 01:26:05 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: the stream also need donators name on screen
[2017-03-04 01:26:05 UTC] yuichimccry: @DarksydePhil I watched every Nioh, RE7, and Dark Souls redemption you put up. People focus on you raging. Embrace it and turn it into a gimmick like you did with you know what.
[2017-03-04 01:26:05 UTC] bammbino: we want to be your best friend w/o being your best friend
[2017-03-04 01:26:08 UTC] annabac: interact, have fun
[2017-03-04 01:26:19 UTC] faisalking11: and a lil rage here and there is cool!!
[2017-03-04 01:26:25 UTC] annabac: ofcourse
[2017-03-04 01:26:25 UTC] sasuke2745: just lay back and chill
[2017-03-04 01:26:25 UTC] darksydephil: How do streamers handle the on demand stuff? Leave it up as archives?
[2017-03-04 01:26:28 UTC] mtsaint: Record your gameplay with no commentary and upload that to YT. Keep your commentary for Twitch
[2017-03-04 01:26:30 UTC] icureditwithmybrain: Most important is having a fun positive atmosphere imo
[2017-03-04 01:26:39 UTC] bammbino: most dont give a fuck
[2017-03-04 01:26:40 UTC] cainmasters: Real talk Phil just play a game and rage, make jokes you know the usual and it should pop
[2017-03-04 01:26:42 UTC] zahvone: Some of them record it, some leave on archive and turn them into the funniest stream moment clips.
[2017-03-04 01:26:42 UTC] jonsnow23456: Fuck no
[2017-03-04 01:26:44 UTC] abortionpill: lmao
[2017-03-04 01:26:44 UTC] hippostabber: maybe older games you are we versed in to make it easier to begin
[2017-03-04 01:26:55 UTC] bammbino: they leave it up for all, not just subs
[2017-03-04 01:26:57 UTC] jonsnow23456: MTsaint Fuck no
[2017-03-04 01:27:03 UTC] bammbino: only the tittle streamers have it locked to subs
[2017-03-04 01:27:06 UTC] darksydephil: Gaming on youtube may be completely out of the question so im talking about here
[2017-03-04 01:27:08 UTC] annabac: the one i check, they do archive because they dont really do youtube unless they edit stuff for the yt
[2017-03-04 01:27:09 UTC] bammbino: tittie*
[2017-03-04 01:27:21 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: people do watch the archive on twitch because the chat is saved
[2017-03-04 01:27:26 UTC] cainmasters: You could have sub only vods
[2017-03-04 01:27:34 UTC] boxman222: some do but many dont
[2017-03-04 01:27:39 UTC] bammbino: yeah for here, they dont care about the vods much cause the experience is almost like live
[2017-03-04 01:27:48 UTC] cainmasters: But I don't know if anyone does that other than capcomfighters
[2017-03-04 01:28:00 UTC] boxman222: and some just upload selective sessions to youtube
[2017-03-04 01:28:02 UTC] zahvone: @DarksydePhil So, I bought some editing software about a year ago with the intent to record and edit my own videos. That never happened so - I was wondering if you'd be okay with me editing stream clips that I find funny and uploading them?..
[2017-03-04 01:28:04 UTC] bammbino: for example.. if i missed your coverage on zelda, i can come to your vod and there will be the gameplay WITH chat since its recorded
[2017-03-04 01:28:07 UTC] darksydephil: Yeah i wouldnt do sub only vods
[2017-03-04 01:28:24 UTC] darksydephil: Yes i saw that with the christmas stream actually
[2017-03-04 01:28:25 UTC] bammbino: so if you talk to boxman222 during a playthrough i can see what he asked
[2017-03-04 01:28:29 UTC] bammbino: and what you said to him
[2017-03-04 01:28:30 UTC] icureditwithmybrain: @Bammbino Agreed 99% of people on twitch watch it live
[2017-03-04 01:28:35 UTC] darksydephil: Chat was preserved
[2017-03-04 01:28:38 UTC] mtsaint: @jonsnow23456 Why not?
[2017-03-04 01:29:10 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, theres one BIG thing that has been known on twitch since its inception and its: EU is the primary supporters on this site
[2017-03-04 01:29:11 UTC] mtsaint: YT could be more of a hobby he could continue whereas Twitch would be the job that makes him money
[2017-03-04 01:29:12 UTC] boxman222: i am probably one of the few people who use the archive feature
[2017-03-04 01:29:20 UTC] boxman222: usually not many views on those even for big streamers
[2017-03-04 01:29:27 UTC] mtsaint: Plus Twitch is much better than YT now
[2017-03-04 01:29:32 UTC] jonsnow23456: Because not everyone can watch the streams live,also his audience on twitch isn't as big as on youtube,it's youtube who made him well known
[2017-03-04 01:29:42 UTC] mtsaint: Adapt or perish
[2017-03-04 01:29:43 UTC] royal_phalanx91: would you consider doing sub and patreon participation only twitch and chill sessions? It's really hard for many of us to participate, and it'll reward subs and patrons
[2017-03-04 01:29:45 UTC] cainmasters: Why they taking long with the switch bro I got a tournament tomorrow need to sleep lol
[2017-03-04 01:29:48 UTC] bammbino: DarksydePhil, 90% of the streamers have a time that is EU friendly cause of the high viewership and potential subs/donation and a stream that suits USA too
[2017-03-04 01:29:53 UTC] mtsaint: Most youtubers stream on Twitch, almost exclusively
[2017-03-04 01:30:15 UTC] mtsaint: They'll post a video on YT to let subs know they're streaming and if anything, they upload highlight
[2017-03-04 01:30:19 UTC] darksydephil: What would be considered a EU friendly time to stream??
[2017-03-04 01:30:22 UTC] mtsaint: that's it lol
[2017-03-04 01:30:29 UTC] bammbino: AM lol
[2017-03-04 01:30:38 UTC] jonsnow23456: It's not as simple as you think it is
[2017-03-04 01:30:39 UTC] cainmasters: Now
[2017-03-04 01:30:39 UTC] annabac: it's 2:30 am netherlands now
[2017-03-04 01:30:43 UTC] cainmasters: I'm in the eu
[2017-03-04 01:30:44 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Yep, lots of your viewers live in the EU, do some streams in the morning and another in the evening
[2017-03-04 01:30:50 UTC] annabac: england 1 or 2 hour differance
[2017-03-04 01:30:51 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: 8 am - 12 pm pst is prime time EU
[2017-03-04 01:30:51 UTC] radicaldreamer1: even the reviewtechusa guy streams gamingcontent on twitch ;)
[2017-03-04 01:30:56 UTC] royal_phalanx91: It's 1:31 AM UK time now
[2017-03-04 01:30:57 UTC] cainmasters: 130 in the uk
[2017-03-04 01:30:58 UTC] bammbino: annabarc whats the noon time frame for eu viewers?
[2017-03-04 01:31:00 UTC] mtsaint: Also streaming full time for Phil would mean he makes his own schedule, streaming at any time he wants brings in different viewers every time
[2017-03-04 01:31:21 UTC] bammbino: 10am EU is best right?
[2017-03-04 01:31:28 UTC] yuichimccry: @DarksydePhil cut back on some of the jokes too. Like for example Horizon I really wanted to watch it, but the first 10min of your first part turned me off. You got gauge the audience in chat. If youre the only one laughing and stream isnt, its not that funny.
[2017-03-04 01:31:44 UTC] cainmasters: I dunno people are at work and that
[2017-03-04 01:31:45 UTC] jonsnow23456: Not really,in fact it can backfire
[2017-03-04 01:31:48 UTC] annabac: thats early, people work then
[2017-03-04 01:31:51 UTC] darksydephil: Im very interested in trying out the full time streaming thing this week, if nothing works out partnering dspgaming again
[2017-03-04 01:32:01 UTC] mtsaint: You don't know that until you try, now do you?
[2017-03-04 01:32:07 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: 10 am EU is like 12 am PST, everyone is sleep here in america, and people got work and school in EU
[2017-03-04 01:32:16 UTC] zahvone: Check to see if the switch is there lol
[2017-03-04 01:32:17 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, i'd suggest you "wheen" it out rather than going cold turkey
[2017-03-04 01:32:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: 10am EU time wont people have school/work you stream at the moment at 7pm UK time Phil maybe 1 or 2 hours earlier
[2017-03-04 01:32:36 UTC] cainmasters: Won't YouTube just partner you based off your views and that??
[2017-03-04 01:32:39 UTC] annabac: ^
[2017-03-04 01:32:53 UTC] hippostabber: it wouldnt hurt to find a genre of games you like and play alot
[2017-03-04 01:33:00 UTC] royal_phalanx91: maybe start at 5pm EU time, people get off work then
[2017-03-04 01:33:00 UTC] darksydephil: Bammbino, if there are no ads on dspgaming, what is there to ween out? It's not making anything lol
[2017-03-04 01:33:11 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :D
[2017-03-04 01:33:14 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, oh and people take schedules seriously here.. when the stream is say starting at 8am, they want it on 8am not build up or nothing lol its weird
[2017-03-04 01:33:19 UTC] jonsnow23456: Wait he's not with Machinima anymore ? Sorry not in the loop
[2017-03-04 01:33:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: nope jonsnow23456
[2017-03-04 01:33:39 UTC] mtsaint: Watch the vlog when you get the chance
[2017-03-04 01:33:40 UTC] radicaldreamer1: not anymore
[2017-03-04 01:33:41 UTC] darksydephil: Jonsnow is way behind lol
[2017-03-04 01:33:43 UTC] mtsaint: he explains it
[2017-03-04 01:33:51 UTC] royal_phalanx91: all is explained in the vlog
[2017-03-04 01:34:04 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, i meant by your style to wheen out from focusing from only gameplay to having chat involved
[2017-03-04 01:34:19 UTC] darksydephil: Oh i gotcha
[2017-03-04 01:34:21 UTC] jonsnow23456: Sorry,haven't kept up,i was busy with school this week
[2017-03-04 01:34:36 UTC] bammbino: it'll be a big learning experience for fans and you.. we have to adjust to how you incorporate chat and vice versa
[2017-03-04 01:34:36 UTC] cainmasters: The machinima thing isn't related to the previous ad revenue thing is it?
[2017-03-04 01:34:58 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Also I suggest doing more Fan Appreciations like you used to
[2017-03-04 01:35:02 UTC] bammbino: ^^^^^
[2017-03-04 01:35:07 UTC] radicaldreamer1: yeah
[2017-03-04 01:35:07 UTC] bammbino: those are big on twitch
[2017-03-04 01:35:25 UTC] bammbino: only the giant streamers avoid it cause theres too many fans
[2017-03-04 01:35:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yup Royal twitch and chill was a success something along the lines of that would be welcomed
[2017-03-04 01:35:30 UTC] darksydephil: I think i can have streamlabs do the popups and such automatically but i have to figure out how to get them to show up on stream
[2017-03-04 01:35:34 UTC] cainmasters: Stream SFV I bet you'll get a lot of attention
[2017-03-04 01:35:35 UTC] jdomican: I used to watch the 9pm - 12am stream each night and missed the 3am stream because it was too late, im on Ireland time
[2017-03-04 01:35:39 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Have fun with the viewers and chat to them, don't turn off comms like you did with overwatch, engage and chat
[2017-03-04 01:35:46 UTC] mtsaint: Twitch is about streamer and fans first and foremost, but the game doesn't have to take a backseat at all
[2017-03-04 01:36:03 UTC] radicaldreamer1: you can make a test stream :)
[2017-03-04 01:36:15 UTC] mtsaint: Something as easy as discussing where the game's story is headed or whatever goes a long way
[2017-03-04 01:36:25 UTC] mtsaint: with the viewers
[2017-03-04 01:36:27 UTC] bammbino: Mtsaint, is right! even games like dragon age some streamers will focus on the game but will keep up with chat as much as they can
[2017-03-04 01:36:29 UTC] annabac: test it out, or check tutorial from yt
[2017-03-04 01:36:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: if you did go down the full time streamer route Phil how many hours would you be up to streaming each day?
[2017-03-04 01:36:56 UTC] yuichimccry: @DarksydePhil right now you're taking a step in the right direction. You're getting feedback. What if instead of having 3 different channels you condence them into just DSP gaming.
[2017-03-04 01:37:14 UTC] royal_phalanx91: suggest taking a look at voicesfromthedark streams, he's a small time streamer but look at how he does it
[2017-03-04 01:37:17 UTC] cainmasters: Are the biggest streamers ones who play all the new games or ones who are dedicated to one game??
[2017-03-04 01:37:29 UTC] zahvone: Phil, with streamlabs you just have to get the URL and put that into a browser plugin for OBS
[2017-03-04 01:37:33 UTC] rpogaming: The fulltime streaming would be in my humble opinion very benificial for you phill just my 2 cents bud but keep up the good work
[2017-03-04 01:37:34 UTC] bammbino: biggest streamers are variety with a specialty
[2017-03-04 01:37:45 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: They do always play the newest game, but most of them have that 1 game they go back to
[2017-03-04 01:37:48 UTC] rpogaming: btw EU fan here
[2017-03-04 01:37:52 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I think the big streamers play multiple games but not every single one, play what you want to play
[2017-03-04 01:38:02 UTC] boxman222: i hope when you try out streaming you try to cover something different than just the plain regular AAA games.. like maybe some indies or even early access pc games
[2017-03-04 01:38:03 UTC] cainmasters: Seagull had 20k viewers playing ranked overwatch lol
[2017-03-04 01:38:29 UTC] bammbino: yep, even for phil, EU is the biggest fan base
[2017-03-04 01:38:31 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: seagull is not a variety streamer, hes esport person
[2017-03-04 01:38:33 UTC] bammbino: and im okay w/ that
[2017-03-04 01:38:37 UTC] darksydephil: Yeah i dunno if ill be playing full playthroughs of every game doing it this way but if people enjoy the streams and they pay my bills then who cares lol
[2017-03-04 01:38:47 UTC] boxman222: dont even have to finish the games.. just test a few and see if you enjoy them or if viewers does
[2017-03-04 01:39:00 UTC] darksydephil: It just means this will be more about having fun than judging the games and reviewing them i guess
[2017-03-04 01:39:04 UTC] royal_phalanx91: yep, should have also mentioned-try competitive overwatch with your patrons and stuff, make a team and play, esports attracts huge audiences
[2017-03-04 01:39:06 UTC] annabac: its all about the energy
[2017-03-04 01:39:11 UTC] icureditwithmybrain: @DarksydePhil It would be good make friends with other twitch streamers, I often see twitch streamers sending their viewers to other channels when they go offline, thus constant exposure to new fanbases.
[2017-03-04 01:39:22 UTC] annabac: you can make every game good, or not, quit one, play another in the same stream
[2017-03-04 01:39:39 UTC] hippostabber: When do you think you might try to implement some of these suggestions?
[2017-03-04 01:39:43 UTC] cainmasters: Esports competitive gaming is where it's at you know Phil
[2017-03-04 01:39:51 UTC] annabac: be fun to hang around with, from the plebs perspective
[2017-03-04 01:40:02 UTC] darksydephil: Exactly, if im not recording a full playthrough for youtube then it wont matter if i finish anything etc
[2017-03-04 01:40:06 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, your reviews have always been a smash hit with me and many viewers.. do you think the old style will be viable on dspgaming? you, the cam, and the review?
[2017-03-04 01:40:08 UTC] cainmasters: SFV OW LoL
[2017-03-04 01:40:20 UTC] bbt_2017: I hope phil plays Zelda in portable mode. Docked has bad fps dips.
[2017-03-04 01:40:25 UTC] bammbino: the editing takes you away from the games in all honesty
[2017-03-04 01:40:25 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Dunno if Phil will like SF V and LoL lol
[2017-03-04 01:40:32 UTC] bbt_2017: like down to 20fps
[2017-03-04 01:40:39 UTC] annabac: people will come to your stream for you, not the games
[2017-03-04 01:40:50 UTC] zahvone: Why don't you play games like Choice Chamber and Enter the Gungeon a little more often?
[2017-03-04 01:40:52 UTC] abortionpill: "I can be good at games if I want to"
[2017-03-04 01:40:55 UTC] mtsaint: The editing could work for DSPGaming more than anything, especially if KO and TKOHV will be dead
[2017-03-04 01:40:55 UTC] zahvone: People would really eat that shit up
[2017-03-04 01:40:58 UTC] cainmasters: Who wouldn't wanna see Phil play SFV and rage? lol
[2017-03-04 01:41:13 UTC] bammbino: exactly Annabac! i hate yakuza but i was here for chat and to support the new schedule
[2017-03-04 01:41:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he doesn't like doing pogo boomer runs Zahvone :(
[2017-03-04 01:41:15 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I still say you should try competitive overwatch, playing with patrons and subscribers, you already enjoy overwatch so this would be a good fit for you
[2017-03-04 01:41:25 UTC] zahvone: Hahah. But the chat loves it! They eat it up man
[2017-03-04 01:41:27 UTC] boxman222: bbt_2017 why the fuck would it have a lower frame rate when docked?? it is supposed to run at full power then
[2017-03-04 01:41:28 UTC] mtsaint: Edited moments from a Twitch stream or something could be easy
[2017-03-04 01:41:41 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Yeah, everyone loves twitch and chill
[2017-03-04 01:41:42 UTC] zahvone: If you can't look at the chat as much as you'd like - playing games the stream can interact with with go a long, LONG way.
[2017-03-04 01:41:42 UTC] darksydephil: I dont think people are getting it lol, i wont be doing gaming on youtube ANY more. Because i probably cant get dspgaming partnered again
[2017-03-04 01:41:43 UTC] annabac: right :)
[2017-03-04 01:41:57 UTC] cainmasters: I think you can
[2017-03-04 01:42:12 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Try applying to networks anyway
[2017-03-04 01:42:13 UTC] darksydephil: Dunno why some keep bringing up youtube, it could literally be dead this week lol
[2017-03-04 01:42:13 UTC] bbt_2017: @boxman222 It's due to higher resolution combined with lazy port job
[2017-03-04 01:42:13 UTC] cainmasters: Everyone has haters
[2017-03-04 01:42:26 UTC] darksydephil: I already did apply
[2017-03-04 01:42:43 UTC] boxman222: so nintendo completely fucked up their flagship launch game then..
[2017-03-04 01:42:44 UTC] mtsaint: I get it, but if you still wanna use it as a hobby, like it used to be, the people still subbed would probably appreciate it
[2017-03-04 01:42:50 UTC] boxman222: great way to sell the switch
[2017-03-04 01:42:51 UTC] zahvone: Did they?
[2017-03-04 01:42:58 UTC] cainmasters: You'll get through I think. Not everyone gets million views a month
[2017-03-04 01:43:00 UTC] royal_phalanx91: ah ok, just don't write them off just yet, it's just like job applications, you have to keep trying
[2017-03-04 01:43:11 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: full time streamer with highlights of the playthrough on youtube seem like everyone is doing
[2017-03-04 01:43:11 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, cause i am positive and i believe in you.. i dont give into negativity ever since my 2 car accidents and motorcycle accident in 1 years time.. i always hold out and think you will find success on both YT and twitch
[2017-03-04 01:43:18 UTC] icureditwithmybrain: is google adsense really a significant reduction in income?
[2017-03-04 01:43:20 UTC] bbt_2017: @boxman222 Great digital foundry video on it is out
[2017-03-04 01:43:22 UTC] zahvone: It is, yes.
[2017-03-04 01:43:34 UTC] zahvone: Google Adsense is terrible. Unless you can get your CPM way up
[2017-03-04 01:43:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Are there many channel partners out there Phil?
[2017-03-04 01:44:03 UTC] darksydephil: Google adsense will take away ad rights for a lot of gameplay vids sadly
[2017-03-04 01:44:15 UTC] icureditwithmybrain: ah
[2017-03-04 01:44:17 UTC] cainmasters: I got an idea phil
[2017-03-04 01:44:21 UTC] bammbino: cause of nintendo and rockstar right?
[2017-03-04 01:44:35 UTC] dargaine: Phil, some advice from a long time viewer. You've got to stop insulting viewers and game devs, etc. You need good PR to succeed on Twitch.
[2017-03-04 01:44:43 UTC] cainmasters: Hit up capcom and try get in with them with usf2
[2017-03-04 01:44:58 UTC] royal_phalanx91: ^
[2017-03-04 01:45:02 UTC] darksydephil: Thats why i said: full time game streams here, vlogging on youtube. I could easily use adsense for just vlogging as theres nothing they can flag
[2017-03-04 01:45:06 UTC] annabac: you can have some 5 minute breaks, and run ads for the whole time , seen some do that
[2017-03-04 01:45:07 UTC] zahvone: Oh! Phil you could totally play some retro games on Twitch man. HUGE following with that stuff.
[2017-03-04 01:45:13 UTC] cainmasters: ST is your MAIN game really
[2017-03-04 01:45:23 UTC] annabac: once every 1- 2 hours or so
[2017-03-04 01:45:31 UTC] cainmasters: Revive your sf2 stuff
[2017-03-04 01:45:37 UTC] mtsaint: Revisiting Earthbound
[2017-03-04 01:45:55 UTC] abortionpill: finish parasite eve
[2017-03-04 01:46:00 UTC] bammbino: i mean that can work but you would need to change your 2 stream times.. it'd work out cause you'd have all evening with leanna
[2017-03-04 01:46:00 UTC] mtsaint: Mario, Mega Man, etc. etc.
[2017-03-04 01:46:05 UTC] cainmasters: Body all the newbies online in usf2 the stream would be big
[2017-03-04 01:46:18 UTC] radicaldreamer1: just play your favorite game :)
[2017-03-04 01:46:23 UTC] rpogaming: rip dspgaming man. sad to see it go like that
[2017-03-04 01:46:29 UTC] darksydephil: What would be ideal stream times here then?
[2017-03-04 01:46:42 UTC] dweebenheimer20: @Rpogaming nothing he could do man!
[2017-03-04 01:46:47 UTC] royal_phalanx91: 5-6 PM GMT for EU viewers
[2017-03-04 01:46:49 UTC] zahvone: Most streamers start at about 10 AM to 8 PM
[2017-03-04 01:46:54 UTC] zahvone: 12 AM*
[2017-03-04 01:47:04 UTC] bammbino: its hard to say cause EU's timing is very different, but streamers always have peak early and low attendance at nights
[2017-03-04 01:47:21 UTC] localvampyre: do weed smoking videos
[2017-03-04 01:47:24 UTC] theycallmejimbob: 5 might be a little early Royal_Phalanx91 but then again I dunno what is Phil's demographic
[2017-03-04 01:47:44 UTC] cainmasters: Gamers lol
[2017-03-04 01:47:47 UTC] darksydephil: I could easily stream earlier, especially if theres no reason to stay up and babysit videos etc
[2017-03-04 01:47:51 UTC] icureditwithmybrain: @localvampyre wtf lol
[2017-03-04 01:47:51 UTC] boxman222: it is kind of what he did already anyways.
[2017-03-04 01:48:01 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I meant age group Cainmasters :P
[2017-03-04 01:48:02 UTC] zahvone: Get a damn sponsor man lol
[2017-03-04 01:48:10 UTC] radicaldreamer1: dsp doesn't smoke weed :)
[2017-03-04 01:48:10 UTC] boxman222: maybe start a couple of hours earlier
[2017-03-04 01:48:11 UTC] royal_phalanx91: right now your streams start 7PM my time
[2017-03-04 01:48:11 UTC] bammbino: lirik is seriously the only guy on twitch that is well known to come late on his 12pm est streames and EU guys flip out over it
[2017-03-04 01:48:32 UTC] bammbino: but for the most part people love that time frame or a bit earlier
[2017-03-04 01:48:33 UTC] localvampyre: review weed bro, get hella views
[2017-03-04 01:48:39 UTC] boxman222: or one hour earlier than present schedule change
[2017-03-04 01:48:47 UTC] zahvone: "Darksyde Kush"
[2017-03-04 01:48:49 UTC] zahvone: LOL
[2017-03-04 01:48:49 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: EU always going to flip their shit when they dont release their daylight saving comes before america
[2017-03-04 01:48:55 UTC] codenameone: Can you imagine if Phil did smoke weed? It IS legal in his state.
[2017-03-04 01:48:55 UTC] radicaldreamer1: Kappa
[2017-03-04 01:49:05 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: realize*
[2017-03-04 01:49:09 UTC] zahvone: So many DSP tries it videos
[2017-03-04 01:49:15 UTC] cainmasters: Well I guess phils demographic will be like late 20s seeing as we been watching for 8 years lol
[2017-03-04 01:49:18 UTC] bammbino: he starts at 2pm now box so it'd be anywhere from 2-3 hours earlier than current and lets him sleep at night instead of baby sitting videos like he said
[2017-03-04 01:49:26 UTC] bammbino: 29 here in aug
[2017-03-04 01:49:46 UTC] darksydephil: I could start 9-10am my time no problem
[2017-03-04 01:49:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yeah Cainmasters if people have work/college some wont be finished till 5 so no point starting then if he is aiming for a UK audience
[2017-03-04 01:50:02 UTC] localvampyre: use clickbait titles like hot girl smokes weed with girl friends hahahahah
[2017-03-04 01:50:06 UTC] cainmasters: 6pm GMT
[2017-03-04 01:50:23 UTC] abortionpill: lmao who's going to watch your fatass at 9am?
[2017-03-04 01:50:37 UTC] annabac: that would be great
[2017-03-04 01:50:39 UTC] boxman222: you missed the part about this being for europeans?
[2017-03-04 01:50:41 UTC] annabac: eu guys
[2017-03-04 01:50:51 UTC] boxman222: that is when peak numbers are
[2017-03-04 01:51:07 UTC] cainmasters: And by the end of the stream US guys will walk in
[2017-03-04 01:51:17 UTC] darksydephil: So again, what times pst would be the best to stream?
[2017-03-04 01:51:29 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, im gonna do a copy and paste of a schedule, im not trying to plug anyone its for reference only
[2017-03-04 01:51:34 UTC] bammbino: "Cohh is streaming every single day, starting at 8am EST ( 1pm GMT / 2pm CET )"
[2017-03-04 01:51:39 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: 8 am - 12 pm pst seems good
[2017-03-04 01:51:41 UTC] royal_phalanx91: 10 am PST?
[2017-03-04 01:51:44 UTC] cainmasters: West coast is 8 hours behind GMT??
[2017-03-04 01:51:47 UTC] bammbino: He usually streams between 6 and 10 hours, most of the time split into a morning stream and then another afternoon stream after a lunch break. If you want to know when Cohh will be back you can use the !lunch command, which gets updated with the time we expect Cohh to be back from his lunch break.
[2017-03-04 01:51:52 UTC] royal_phalanx91: 10am is a good time to start
[2017-03-04 01:51:52 UTC] abortionpill: 8AM lmao
[2017-03-04 01:52:09 UTC] darksydephil: I could do 10am pst but not est lol
[2017-03-04 01:52:11 UTC] hippostabber: how many days a week bamm
[2017-03-04 01:52:12 UTC] annabac: 10 is good
[2017-03-04 01:52:13 UTC] bammbino: its only an example abortionpill
[2017-03-04 01:52:16 UTC] darksydephil: Thats 7am here
[2017-03-04 01:52:17 UTC] rpogaming: 10 am much better than 8 man no one would watch you at 8am lol
[2017-03-04 01:52:28 UTC] royal_phalanx91: the time converters say gmt is 8 hours behind
[2017-03-04 01:52:52 UTC] bammbino: i think you might need a twitter poll
[2017-03-04 01:52:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yeah 10am would be a good time. Just before Emmerdale
[2017-03-04 01:52:58 UTC] bammbino: thats your best outreach to eu fans
[2017-03-04 01:53:06 UTC] cainmasters: lol emmerdale
[2017-03-04 01:53:10 UTC] zahvone: Phil did your UPS guy actually drown
[2017-03-04 01:53:14 UTC] zahvone: Or did they steal your switch LOL
[2017-03-04 01:53:17 UTC] hippostabber: @Bammbino how many days a week does that guy stream
[2017-03-04 01:53:19 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: 8 am is 1 hour before lirik, maybe people rather not wait for him to stream the newest release game and just watch phil instead
[2017-03-04 01:53:22 UTC] noobrydar: Youtube is constantly getting worse and worse while Twitch gets better. Full time streaming on twitch might be the best move you ever made!
[2017-03-04 01:53:22 UTC] royal_phalanx91: they're late I guess
[2017-03-04 01:53:34 UTC] rpogaming: and yeah EU fan here as i said and you have really legit following here in my country at least not troll fags
[2017-03-04 01:53:38 UTC] bammbino: @Hippostabber, the general thing on twitch is 6 days a week and 1 day off
[2017-03-04 01:54:03 UTC] royal_phalanx91: does anyone deliver at 5pm? you might get the switch next week
[2017-03-04 01:54:33 UTC] noobrydar: I use to have as many subscribers as DSP on youtube but hackers ruined my channel
[2017-03-04 01:54:37 UTC] darksydephil: They deliver until 8pm here lol
[2017-03-04 01:54:37 UTC] bammbino: 6-10 hours a day is also the general per day, but with phil's previous injuries, he cant do it in one sitting
[2017-03-04 01:54:52 UTC] theycallmejimbob: if they have a set time Royal_Phalanx91 they'll usually deliver later on in the day
[2017-03-04 01:54:53 UTC] annabac: ouch
[2017-03-04 01:54:54 UTC] recklessbiscuit1234: what time is it there now?
[2017-03-04 01:55:02 UTC] bammbino: 5:54 for him
[2017-03-04 01:55:19 UTC] royal_phalanx91: lol, the mail here stops deliveries at 5pm
[2017-03-04 01:55:21 UTC] recklessbiscuit1234: oh ok i really wanna see him play the switch
[2017-03-04 01:55:23 UTC] bammbino: i got horizon zero dawn CE delivered at 7:30pm.. like wtf
[2017-03-04 01:55:38 UTC] royal_phalanx91: at least the companies that aren't couriers
[2017-03-04 01:55:44 UTC] noobrydar: support on youtube is horrendous unlike twitch who actually respond to their partners
[2017-03-04 01:55:46 UTC] theycallmejimbob: for DHL and UPS too Royal_Phalanx91?
[2017-03-04 01:56:01 UTC] bammbino: yes, twitch staff is always full of nice people
[2017-03-04 01:56:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah gotcha
[2017-03-04 01:56:50 UTC] royal_phalanx91: not sure, I think couriers will deliver late if you paid them to regardless, only have had Royal and DPD deliver stuff to me
[2017-03-04 01:56:56 UTC] royal_phalanx91: *Royal Mail
[2017-03-04 01:57:26 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, in all honesty man, with positive changes on all accounts here, you will get to a point where you can have leanna be your manager and contact all the gaming companies for copies to show on stream or review(which ever they offer)
[2017-03-04 01:57:27 UTC] darksydephil: Oh boy, the switch apparently gives out your ip on certain screens!!! LOL
[2017-03-04 01:57:34 UTC] darksydephil: Is nintendo for real
[2017-03-04 01:57:42 UTC] bammbino: oh god lol
[2017-03-04 01:57:58 UTC] annabac: blackscreen twitch
[2017-03-04 01:57:58 UTC] radicaldreamer1: wow
[2017-03-04 01:58:01 UTC] royal_phalanx91: lol that is bad
[2017-03-04 01:58:02 UTC] annabac: at those times
[2017-03-04 01:58:08 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you'll have to use a proxy Phil
[2017-03-04 01:58:10 UTC] boxman222: who cares... is not like it works anyways with the sync issues
[2017-03-04 01:58:17 UTC] boxman222: released a patch for it today and it fixed nothing
[2017-03-04 01:58:18 UTC] bammbino: another fucking anti-content creator method from nindendo!
[2017-03-04 01:58:26 UTC] radicaldreamer1: put the facecam over the IP Kappa
[2017-03-04 01:58:26 UTC] royal_phalanx91: use a good VPN
[2017-03-04 01:58:38 UTC] bammbino: @radicaldreamer1, not bad
[2017-03-04 01:59:00 UTC] radicaldreamer1: giving out your IP is always a bad thing
[2017-03-04 01:59:03 UTC] renastella: it really leaks IP?? wow o.o
[2017-03-04 01:59:19 UTC] noobrydar: I think the Switch will be successful console as long as Nintendo promote and focus on the handheld side. Its awesome as next gen handheld, but sucks as a console competing against PS4!
[2017-03-04 01:59:34 UTC] bammbino: yeah but radical is spot on with his ideas.. people on twitch always want streamer cams on
[2017-03-04 01:59:35 UTC] cainmasters: Not during gameplay tho right!? lol
[2017-03-04 01:59:36 UTC] darksydephil: I think the switch is being delivered right now actually
[2017-03-04 01:59:48 UTC] annabac: hype!
[2017-03-04 01:59:50 UTC] boxman222: i think it is too big and clumsy for a handheld
[2017-03-04 01:59:51 UTC] codenameone: Hype
[2017-03-04 01:59:51 UTC] hippostabber: i seen streamlabs fuck up yesterday and leak ip but not the switch it self where did you see that at dsp jw
[2017-03-04 01:59:52 UTC] radicaldreamer1: yea :)
[2017-03-04 01:59:56 UTC] cainmasters: Lesss gooo
[2017-03-04 02:00:03 UTC] darksydephil: Let me check brb
[2017-03-04 02:00:03 UTC] boxman222: and they already had success with DS, so why risk it?
[2017-03-04 02:00:18 UTC] boxman222: they shoud just have made a good console
[2017-03-04 02:00:19 UTC] radicaldreamer1: its time to switch!
[2017-03-04 02:00:34 UTC] annabac: :<
[2017-03-04 02:00:34 UTC] cainmasters: Is it a hand held primarily?
[2017-03-04 02:00:39 UTC] noobrydar: YES DSP please use a VPN! Dont let haters ruin your Twitch channel
[2017-03-04 02:01:12 UTC] annabac: if he knows where it will be displayed cover it, or just vpn yeah
[2017-03-04 02:01:17 UTC] 007blaine: yes and Zelda Breath of The Wild is good
[2017-03-04 02:01:47 UTC] royal_phalanx91: only problem is vpn can slow your connection
[2017-03-04 02:01:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Is there a comparison between the wii u and switch version of BOTW yet?
[2017-03-04 02:02:06 UTC] rpogaming: not can it will slow it
[2017-03-04 02:02:11 UTC] annabac: then be smart about it and very carfull
[2017-03-04 02:02:40 UTC] 007blaine: no
[2017-03-04 02:02:55 UTC] cainmasters: What could someone do with an IP address??
[2017-03-04 02:03:09 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Find out where you live
[2017-03-04 02:03:09 UTC] hippostabber: really
[2017-03-04 02:03:15 UTC] annabac: ddos
[2017-03-04 02:03:17 UTC] radicaldreamer1: terrible things :o
[2017-03-04 02:03:24 UTC] annabac: dox
[2017-03-04 02:03:43 UTC] bammbino: man.. this day feels good
[2017-03-04 02:03:46 UTC] rpogaming: use your pc as a slave peer to peer cp uploader in a botnet
[2017-03-04 02:03:55 UTC] royal_phalanx91: People are guaranteed to call the SWAT team in if they knew where he was
[2017-03-04 02:04:16 UTC] bammbino: phil getting good feedback and hes gonna blow some steam off on this garbage ass console they call switch
[2017-03-04 02:04:33 UTC] annabac: :)
[2017-03-04 02:04:34 UTC] bammbino: $80 for a controller, what the hell
[2017-03-04 02:04:51 UTC] cainmasters: lol peak
[2017-03-04 02:04:51 UTC] simonrez: $80 is too much for a controller. Nonsensical.
[2017-03-04 02:05:12 UTC] tifftafftofftuff: but BoTW
[2017-03-04 02:05:17 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: if you think $80 is too much for a controller, do not look at arcade sticks prices
[2017-03-04 02:05:24 UTC] bammbino: he said he wont buy it but i fucking bet he will! people have complained that the things hurt your hands and need a pro controller
[2017-03-04 02:05:42 UTC] cainmasters: Arcade sticks are different
[2017-03-04 02:05:56 UTC] annabac: silly nintendo with their silly gimmicks :<
[2017-03-04 02:06:09 UTC] rpogaming: remember when the wii was a silly gimmick? XD
[2017-03-04 02:06:17 UTC] annabac: it still is
[2017-03-04 02:06:17 UTC] rpogaming: and then sold massively
[2017-03-04 02:06:19 UTC] cainmasters: Gimmicks keeps them minted lol
[2017-03-04 02:06:20 UTC] bammbino: did they not see the sony press conferences at E3??
[2017-03-04 02:06:21 UTC] bbt_2017: I use the joycons in their grip feels like a 360 controller with small sticks and 4 buttons instead of a dpad
[2017-03-04 02:06:25 UTC] annabac: and never got good games on it
[2017-03-04 02:06:26 UTC] darksydephil: Ok its here
[2017-03-04 02:06:30 UTC] bammbino: no gimmicks sells your system
[2017-03-04 02:06:44 UTC] cainmasters: Jeez let's go
[2017-03-04 02:06:45 UTC] annabac: it just sold and was cheaper
[2017-03-04 02:06:46 UTC] darksydephil: Im gonna try to set up streamlabs to work with the stream tonight, a good test
[2017-03-04 02:06:54 UTC] annabac: cool man
[2017-03-04 02:07:06 UTC] zahvone: You got the switch!?
[2017-03-04 02:07:17 UTC] zahvone: Phil you got it?! Oh shit. Dude I've been waiting for this all day.
[2017-03-04 02:07:19 UTC] rpogaming: nice one streamlabs
[2017-03-04 02:07:33 UTC] recklessbiscuit1234: he got it?
[2017-03-04 02:07:36 UTC] renastella: phil, make sure you do the taste test with botw XD
[2017-03-04 02:07:39 UTC] zahvone: Also if you need help with Streamlabs, let me know. I'll try to help you out.
[2017-03-04 02:07:54 UTC] bammbino: despite knowing hes gonna be mad, i still hope he has fun with this system
[2017-03-04 02:08:06 UTC] bammbino: fun phil is the best phil
[2017-03-04 02:08:17 UTC] bbt_2017: Yes phil taste test the cartridge lol all the journalists have been doing it
[2017-03-04 02:08:26 UTC] bammbino: LOL you saw it too?
[2017-03-04 02:08:33 UTC] annabac: kek
[2017-03-04 02:08:45 UTC] cainmasters: What does it taste like?
[2017-03-04 02:08:50 UTC] darksydephil: ok im here
[2017-03-04 02:08:50 UTC] cainmasters: lol
[2017-03-04 02:08:54 UTC] darksydephil: let me take a look at steamlabs
[2017-03-04 02:08:59 UTC] darksydephil: see how this works exactly lol
[2017-03-04 02:08:59 UTC] noobrydar: @DarksydePhil, I have something very IMPORTANT to tell you.....
[2017-03-04 02:09:04 UTC] codenameone: The carts taste like desperation.
[2017-03-04 02:09:09 UTC] darksydephil: whats that NoobRydar
[2017-03-04 02:09:14 UTC] codenameone: Nintendo's desperation.
[2017-03-04 02:09:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the cartridges are the same size as the ds/3ds :D
[2017-03-04 02:09:42 UTC] bbt_2017: smaller actually @theycallmejimbob
[2017-03-04 02:09:43 UTC] hippostabber: you better lick that cart on stream
[2017-03-04 02:09:59 UTC] cainmasters: So it's basically a ds?
[2017-03-04 02:10:12 UTC] darksydephil: okay anyone know how to do this with steamlabs?
[2017-03-04 02:10:14 UTC] darksydephil: it seems confusing
[2017-03-04 02:10:16 UTC] bammbino: anyone want a link to a YT video of cartridge licking for switch
[2017-03-04 02:10:25 UTC] zahvone: Yeah I use Streamlabs, to an extent
[2017-03-04 02:10:32 UTC] noobrydar: @DarksydePhil, There is a thing on youtube where sometimes people leave there MCN and discovered that their montezation tab is permanently turned off
[2017-03-04 02:10:47 UTC] bammbino: idk how to use it but when the streamers use it they take time off stream to set it up as it takes a bit of a process
[2017-03-04 02:10:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ty bbt_2017 I was just looking at a pic of it.
[2017-03-04 02:10:57 UTC] bbt_2017: @cainmasters It's way stronger than a DS it's portable though and stronger than Wii U slightly weaker than Xbox one
[2017-03-04 02:10:58 UTC] bammbino: change thing
[2017-03-04 02:11:02 UTC] darksydephil: oh wait i think i see it
[2017-03-04 02:11:25 UTC] codenameone: HYPE
[2017-03-04 02:11:54 UTC] codenameone: "I think I see it" = waiting for package blue balls.
[2017-03-04 02:11:57 UTC] zahvone: What do you need help with, Phil?
[2017-03-04 02:12:03 UTC] theycallmejimbob: do you think it's a risky move bbt_2017 given the piracy issues they had with ds/3ds cartridges
[2017-03-04 02:12:11 UTC] annabac: xD
[2017-03-04 02:12:30 UTC] noobrydar: @DarksydePhil, I know that you had an issue with your adsense some years ago being disabled. Was that disabled adsense ever connected to your dspgaming channel? If so, you may not ever be able to run ads on your channel again after leaving the mcn
[2017-03-04 02:12:31 UTC] boxman222: i wonder rif he is going to use a greenscreen now for facecam
[2017-03-04 02:12:34 UTC] darksydephil: ok i think ive got this figured out
[2017-03-04 02:12:46 UTC] darksydephil: no it wasnt noobrydar
[2017-03-04 02:12:48 UTC] darksydephil: no worries
[2017-03-04 02:13:01 UTC] zahvone: Yeah, all you have to do is find the url for the notification you want to use, and in OBS you paste it in a browser source.
[2017-03-04 02:13:06 UTC] zahvone: It's literally copy paste
[2017-03-04 02:13:41 UTC] darksydephil: yeah im messing with it now
[2017-03-04 02:13:44 UTC] darksydephil: making sure sounds are OFF lol
[2017-03-04 02:14:03 UTC] zahvone: Definitely.
[2017-03-04 02:14:06 UTC] noobrydar: @DarksydePhil, ok good, then you have nothing to worry about. But whatever you do, never partner directly with adsense. Your haters will click bomb you and permanently ruin that channel.
[2017-03-04 02:14:15 UTC] zahvone: Down the line you should be able to add custom images and soundclips, as well though
[2017-03-04 02:14:20 UTC] bbt_2017: @theycallmejimbob I'm sure they've thought of something this time. If I were Nintendo I'd be tired of every game getting pirated
[2017-03-04 02:14:30 UTC] zahvone: Generally speaking streamers will keep the notification sounds ON, but the voice to text feature off.
[2017-03-04 02:14:52 UTC] chem_zegarra2018: What's with the stream title?
[2017-03-04 02:15:03 UTC] zahvone: It was an earlier stream.
[2017-03-04 02:15:04 UTC] darksydephil: anyone have like 1 bit? because iw ant to test this quickly, dont do it YET but let me know if you can
[2017-03-04 02:15:15 UTC] zahvone: I have some.
[2017-03-04 02:15:25 UTC] darksydephil: ok give me a sec, thanks
[2017-03-04 02:16:00 UTC] bbt_2017: 👍
[2017-03-04 02:16:09 UTC] noobrydar: I can buy some bits for you @DarksydePhil
[2017-03-04 02:16:12 UTC] zahvone: Oh, also they have preview features so you can "test" notifications. It'll pretend someone sent you bits or tips etc
[2017-03-04 02:16:15 UTC] darksydephil: okay, can you cheer 1 bit?
[2017-03-04 02:16:28 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you need to cheer 10 since that's the min
[2017-03-04 02:16:31 UTC] zahvone: cheer10
[2017-03-04 02:16:38 UTC] zahvone: The minimum is 10 but there you go
[2017-03-04 02:16:46 UTC] darksydephil: cool it worked but it still played the fucking sound lolol
[2017-03-04 02:16:48 UTC] darksydephil: and it was loud as shit
[2017-03-04 02:17:03 UTC] zahvone: You can turn that down. Generally streamers keep the sound on so they know when they get a cheer, etc
[2017-03-04 02:18:29 UTC] darksydephil: oh, i didnt save the settings
[2017-03-04 02:18:30 UTC] darksydephil: stupid me lol
[2017-03-04 02:18:34 UTC] zahvone: lol
[2017-03-04 02:19:09 UTC] zahvone: Yo so, are you going to play the switch on it's handheld or?
[2017-03-04 02:19:22 UTC] fffffasdfasdas: you cant stream the switch in handheld mode
[2017-03-04 02:19:35 UTC] annabac: you can set cheer minimum on like 60 or 100 also, so not every 1 or 5 cheer will be played
[2017-03-04 02:19:45 UTC] darksydephil: the default picture is a zombie, wtf
[2017-03-04 02:19:47 UTC] zahvone: mmm
[2017-03-04 02:19:51 UTC] zahvone: lol
[2017-03-04 02:19:55 UTC] darksydephil: i wonder if i can do this without a picture at all for now
[2017-03-04 02:19:57 UTC] zahvone: It's a zombie running
[2017-03-04 02:20:03 UTC] zahvone: You could.
[2017-03-04 02:20:11 UTC] zahvone: You should try to embrace all of the features though, honestly.
[2017-03-04 02:20:43 UTC] royal_phalanx91: try changing it
[2017-03-04 02:20:46 UTC] jwalker70: I really hope you dont give up on KOGaming
[2017-03-04 02:21:07 UTC] darksydephil: there may shortly be no way for me to make money on anything but vlogs on youtube
[2017-03-04 02:21:11 UTC] darksydephil: its not a matter of giving up
[2017-03-04 02:21:23 UTC] doctorzzz: my body is ready
[2017-03-04 02:21:31 UTC] boxman222: you will still make money from the videos that are not claimed though?
[2017-03-04 02:21:38 UTC] boxman222: through normal youtube adsense or whatever they call it
[2017-03-04 02:21:55 UTC] jwalker70: But I still want to see reviews and countdowns
[2017-03-04 02:22:13 UTC] darksydephil: normal adsense will not work, as people have said
[2017-03-04 02:22:19 UTC] darksydephil: people will click the fuck out of them just to get me kicked out
[2017-03-04 02:22:21 UTC] boxman222: weird
[2017-03-04 02:23:01 UTC] failystone: Sorry I just bought some bits how can I give them?
[2017-03-04 02:23:08 UTC] jwalker70: but that was 6 years ago maybe they're better about it
[2017-03-04 02:23:10 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil, how big is your European audience? Might wanna consider doing first stteam at 9am
[2017-03-04 02:23:17 UTC] failystone: cheer 500
[2017-03-04 02:23:26 UTC] popsicolo: Phil will being doing onscreen notifications tonight.
[2017-03-04 02:23:29 UTC] failystone: "cheer" 500
[2017-03-04 02:23:36 UTC] popsicolo: "/cheer#"
[2017-03-04 02:24:01 UTC] failystone: cheer500
[2017-03-04 02:24:08 UTC] pasc4l: VapeNation
[2017-03-04 02:24:18 UTC] annabac: dspWowdude
[2017-03-04 02:24:42 UTC] failystone: Never give up Phil. GOodnight all for now
[2017-03-04 02:24:44 UTC] blue_blur64: Well I'm finally taking a break from Zelda lol
[2017-03-04 02:25:13 UTC] annabac: gn man
[2017-03-04 02:25:15 UTC] popsicolo: If I knew Phil was doing onscreen notifications, I would waited to resub.
[2017-03-04 02:25:33 UTC] cplkevlar: We about to see a new Switch today?
[2017-03-04 02:25:41 UTC] darksydephil: ok so i got th enotifications working supposedly, and no pics with it, just text for now as this is a test
[2017-03-04 02:25:42 UTC] zahvone: lol
[2017-03-04 02:25:53 UTC] cplkevlar: Very well then
[2017-03-04 02:26:01 UTC] zahvone: is there sound
[2017-03-04 02:26:04 UTC] blue_blur64: I would recommend having a higher minimum for notifications that way people can't spam with like 1-10 bits every few seconds
[2017-03-04 02:26:16 UTC] doctorzzz: dont need to be perfect for now, that evolves over time
[2017-03-04 02:26:18 UTC] darksydephil: what about the messages? leave them for bits or no?
[2017-03-04 02:26:18 UTC] annabac: ^
[2017-03-04 02:26:22 UTC] darksydephil: good call blue_blur64 changing that now
[2017-03-04 02:26:36 UTC] popsicolo: If I was a streamer, my notification would either be Tom from Tom and Jerry screaming, or "Loud Nigra"
[2017-03-04 02:26:40 UTC] blue_blur64: Messages don't need to pop up either, you can just read them if you want
[2017-03-04 02:26:51 UTC] doctorzzz: 100 bits for message seems reasonable
[2017-03-04 02:26:52 UTC] darksydephil: i made the minimum 25 bits
[2017-03-04 02:27:08 UTC] darksydephil: should i do more? 100?
[2017-03-04 02:27:14 UTC] zahvone: no
[2017-03-04 02:27:15 UTC] doctorzzz: well whats your average
[2017-03-04 02:27:18 UTC] annabac: nah see how it works out
[2017-03-04 02:27:18 UTC] pasc4l: no
[2017-03-04 02:27:24 UTC] alexander_rossi: 100 is too high
[2017-03-04 02:27:24 UTC] jwalker70: 100 is good
[2017-03-04 02:27:25 UTC] popsicolo: Maybe it's best to play it by ear.
[2017-03-04 02:27:25 UTC] undeadwill88: When is stream?
[2017-03-04 02:27:27 UTC] alexander_rossi: 25 seems around right
[2017-03-04 02:27:30 UTC] popsicolo: See what works first
[2017-03-04 02:27:32 UTC] zahvone: keep it open for now
[2017-03-04 02:27:35 UTC] annabac: its just so it wont be a hindrance to a stream for spam
[2017-03-04 02:27:36 UTC] ziibrah: It should be 25-50 imo
[2017-03-04 02:27:41 UTC] pasc4l: normal twitch streamers get like 25 at a time
[2017-03-04 02:27:46 UTC] doctorzzz: yeah keep it low and if it gets to spammy just raise it
[2017-03-04 02:27:47 UTC] darksydephil: ok ill do 25 then
[2017-03-04 02:27:51 UTC] pasc4l: <
[2017-03-04 02:27:53 UTC] pasc4l: <3
[2017-03-04 02:27:53 UTC] darksydephil: it seems to still play msuic sometimes and i dunno why lol
[2017-03-04 02:27:57 UTC] darksydephil: i turned the sound to 0 for everything
[2017-03-04 02:28:10 UTC] darksydephil: bit messages on or off?
[2017-03-04 02:28:16 UTC] bigbadskonk: hey phil!
[2017-03-04 02:28:18 UTC] zahvone: on
[2017-03-04 02:28:19 UTC] ziibrah: on
[2017-03-04 02:28:22 UTC] bigbadskonk: on
[2017-03-04 02:28:22 UTC] pasc4l: i would say on
[2017-03-04 02:28:31 UTC] darksydephil: ok
[2017-03-04 02:28:33 UTC] darksydephil: prepare for insults
[2017-03-04 02:28:34 UTC] undeadwill88: SMOrc What is going on?
[2017-03-04 02:28:34 UTC] darksydephil: lol
[2017-03-04 02:28:37 UTC] doctorzzz: on but dont use text to speech, thats gonna end in cancer
[2017-03-04 02:28:38 UTC] pasc4l: yeah
[2017-03-04 02:28:39 UTC] bigbadskonk: lol
[2017-03-04 02:28:44 UTC] twitchnotify: FailyStone just subscribed!
[2017-03-04 02:29:00 UTC] austinthekootz: lol
[2017-03-04 02:29:00 UTC] annabac: yeah maybe and maybe it will be less in the future
[2017-03-04 02:29:05 UTC] doctorzzz: well if the hater cheer to insult, its free money
[2017-03-04 02:29:08 UTC] jwalker70: So do the messages appear on screen too?
[2017-03-04 02:29:10 UTC] blue_blur64: From the only 2 I watch, one person has it where they've only acknowledged at 100 bits or more but left the sound on, and neither of them have messages appear besides the name of the person who donated or subbed
[2017-03-04 02:29:12 UTC] undeadwill88: So phil is is true that you aren't with machiniama anymore? :c
[2017-03-04 02:29:18 UTC] zahvone: you streaming yet ?
[2017-03-04 02:29:18 UTC] bigbadskonk: have you gotten the switch yet phil?
[2017-03-04 02:29:29 UTC] annabac: sub hype dspSexy
[2017-03-04 02:29:30 UTC] doctorzzz: he has it yes
[2017-03-04 02:29:31 UTC] ziibrah: FailyStone, <3
[2017-03-04 02:29:32 UTC] popsicolo: If Phil used text to speech, I would probably type "AEIOU AEIOU JOHN MADDEN"
[2017-03-04 02:29:35 UTC] noobrydar: dspWowdude dspWowdude dspWowdude
[2017-03-04 02:29:43 UTC] pasc4l: if you ban haters that are sending bits, then you are losing a guaranteed source of income
[2017-03-04 02:29:44 UTC] noobrydar: sub hype
[2017-03-04 02:30:00 UTC] royal_phalanx91: It's the trolls' loss, they decided to give money to someone they hate
[2017-03-04 02:30:15 UTC] pasc4l: its mutually beneficial
[2017-03-04 02:30:24 UTC] darksydephil: okay i think we're good to go, lets see how this turns out lol. could be spam city
[2017-03-04 02:30:27 UTC] pasc4l: one side gets money, the other gets a cheap laugh
[2017-03-04 02:30:38 UTC] popsicolo: This is a brave new world for Phil, so we gotta see what happens.
[2017-03-04 02:30:44 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Thats a good thing though lol
[2017-03-04 02:30:44 UTC] blue_blur64: Well, I guess we can talk about the Switch for those that used it so far :P
[2017-03-04 02:30:47 UTC] doctorzzz: you should use some sound clips of your own later, like nozhing i could do for resub or something
[2017-03-04 02:30:48 UTC] ziibrah: just increase it to 50-100 minimum if it gets too spammy
[2017-03-04 02:30:55 UTC] annabac: a whole new wooooorld
[2017-03-04 02:30:55 UTC] hippostabber: just roll with it
[2017-03-04 02:30:58 UTC] zahvone: indeed
[2017-03-04 02:31:06 UTC] popsicolo: BRAAAAVE NEW WOOOOORLD
[2017-03-04 02:31:08 UTC] darksydephil: LOL it could say nothing i coudl do or SON OF A BITCH when people do thsi
[2017-03-04 02:31:11 UTC] darksydephil: thats pretty funny man
[2017-03-04 02:31:13 UTC] bigbadskonk: Iis text to speech on phil?
[2017-03-04 02:31:27 UTC] zahvone: exactly
[2017-03-04 02:31:31 UTC] bigbadskonk: is*
[2017-03-04 02:31:32 UTC] annabac: lol
[2017-03-04 02:31:39 UTC] infinitysnake293: if at all possible is there a filter for word on cheers you can add? just in case people want to make rude or unethical cheers?
[2017-03-04 02:31:43 UTC] zawarud00: whats up guys
[2017-03-04 02:31:45 UTC] popsicolo: Notifications sounds are a good way to be creative.
[2017-03-04 02:31:48 UTC] radicaldreamer1: just say "wow dude"
[2017-03-04 02:31:49 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Text to speech is ideal
[2017-03-04 02:31:54 UTC] snortburnell: yo phil how is it going
[2017-03-04 02:31:57 UTC] royal_phalanx91: "cahmaan d00d"
[2017-03-04 02:31:58 UTC] bbt_2017: Man...it's gonna be so weird seeing phil do "proper" streaming stuff...
[2017-03-04 02:32:06 UTC] codenameone: How about "Here we go, ladies and gentlemen, woot woot woot woot" from the Crash Bandicoot playthrough as the sub notification sound?
[2017-03-04 02:32:07 UTC] zawarud00: dont do text to speech or else a bunch of racist fucks wil;l use the n word and get the channel insta ban
[2017-03-04 02:32:07 UTC] darksydephil: people will be doing rude cheers i msure lol
[2017-03-04 02:32:10 UTC] ziibrah: using text to speech is a terrible idea lol
[2017-03-04 02:32:13 UTC] bigbadskonk: text to speech will probably get abused
[2017-03-04 02:32:18 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Ok course, most of them will lul
[2017-03-04 02:32:20 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh yeah, having different sounds depending on how high of a bit donation there is would be incentive :P
[2017-03-04 02:32:22 UTC] doctorzzz: text to speech is cancer, would not recommend, while it might make some money, it can end really bad
[2017-03-04 02:32:33 UTC] annabac: thanks for the mony iggnore message
[2017-03-04 02:32:34 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: DSP you could also listen to music now when you play games if you wanted
[2017-03-04 02:32:35 UTC] pasc4l: text to speech can be a ton of fun
[2017-03-04 02:32:38 UTC] royal_phalanx91: would text cheers show up on screen?
[2017-03-04 02:32:46 UTC] zahvone: yes
[2017-03-04 02:32:59 UTC] jwalker70: will the notifications play the messages to?
[2017-03-04 02:33:01 UTC] blue_blur64: That is true, if you do go 100% twitch they don't care about any music until the stream ends
[2017-03-04 02:33:01 UTC] failystone: cheer1500 also gonna become patreon. We will get through this
[2017-03-04 02:33:03 UTC] bigbadskonk: yea playing music inthe backround would be nice
[2017-03-04 02:33:17 UTC] annabac: PogChamp
[2017-03-04 02:33:22 UTC] zawarud00: i also recommend him to open up paypal donations
[2017-03-04 02:33:23 UTC] darksydephil: thanks faily but wtf
[2017-03-04 02:33:27 UTC] ziibrah: FailyStone, what a nice guy
[2017-03-04 02:33:27 UTC] darksydephil: it made another LOUD NOISE when you did that
[2017-03-04 02:33:29 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: wow faily stone nice
[2017-03-04 02:33:30 UTC] popsicolo: FailyStone, you might want to wait.
[2017-03-04 02:33:31 UTC] darksydephil: how the fuck do i turn it off lol
[2017-03-04 02:33:34 UTC] bigbadskonk: he cant do paypal
[2017-03-04 02:33:38 UTC] diegot15: Good luck man, havent seen your footage in years!
[2017-03-04 02:33:42 UTC] blue_blur64: dem noises Kappa
[2017-03-04 02:33:49 UTC] popsicolo: Hold onto your bits until we get started.
[2017-03-04 02:33:53 UTC] royal_phalanx91: deafening Phil Kappa
[2017-03-04 02:33:58 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Look to see if there are different sounds for different amounts
[2017-03-04 02:33:59 UTC] fizzedoff: Bits for days tbh.
[2017-03-04 02:34:01 UTC] annabac: haha
[2017-03-04 02:34:07 UTC] skysands2017: @zawarud00 he can't do paypal. he already stated why he can't do that
[2017-03-04 02:34:08 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Well now that you have enabled it your stuck with it forrever Kappa
[2017-03-04 02:34:09 UTC] ziibrah: there are probably different sound volumes for different amounts?
[2017-03-04 02:34:10 UTC] skysands2017: Hello everyone
[2017-03-04 02:34:17 UTC] snortburnell: hello
[2017-03-04 02:34:19 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh yeah, I finally figured out why there's certain days where I can't watch an ad for bits
[2017-03-04 02:34:21 UTC] zahvone: keep the sounds lol
[2017-03-04 02:34:23 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: hello skysands
[2017-03-04 02:34:28 UTC] bigbadskonk: When is the stream gonna start phil?
[2017-03-04 02:34:33 UTC] jmon_1985: whats the holdup? lets do this
[2017-03-04 02:34:34 UTC] doctorzzz: you can turn down the sound in the sound mixer , just look for the browser tab
[2017-03-04 02:34:35 UTC] blue_blur64: They only have a limited amount of ads to use per day this way LUL
[2017-03-04 02:35:09 UTC] darksydephil: OKAY i found what the problem was
[2017-03-04 02:35:14 UTC] darksydephil: muting that shit now
[2017-03-04 02:35:19 UTC] blue_blur64: @Bigbadskonk, @jmon_1985, he's testing out different notifications for bits and subs. Once he's set the stream will start
[2017-03-04 02:35:20 UTC] darksydephil: it's hidden in a special alerts menu
[2017-03-04 02:35:34 UTC] bigbadskonk: ok
[2017-03-04 02:35:42 UTC] skysands2017: good
[2017-03-04 02:36:11 UTC] blue_blur64: Phil, I think you're gonna love Zelda
[2017-03-04 02:36:16 UTC] zahvone: when will you start?
[2017-03-04 02:36:39 UTC] blue_blur64: The freedom you get in it shits all over FF15 and Horizon's LUL
[2017-03-04 02:36:46 UTC] skysands2017: Zelda is beautiful, but I regret ordering the Switch. Saw many people reporting issues with day 1 models
[2017-03-04 02:36:56 UTC] zawarud00: Zelda might be overhyped we will see
[2017-03-04 02:37:02 UTC] blue_blur64: I haven't had any issues so far
[2017-03-04 02:37:03 UTC] ducksydephil: 0__0
[2017-03-04 02:37:04 UTC] pasc4l: phil isnt going to hear anything?
[2017-03-04 02:37:18 UTC] blue_blur64: Besides my awful internet when I tried setting it up, it's been smooth sailing
[2017-03-04 02:37:23 UTC] skysands2017: I'm kinda afraid since there's no customer service for Nintendo stuff here. Have to ship it to US if anything gone wrong
[2017-03-04 02:37:28 UTC] noobrydar: @skysands2017, what kind of issues is the switch having?
[2017-03-04 02:37:52 UTC] bigbadskonk: @skysands2017 where do you live
[2017-03-04 02:37:58 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm guessing it deals with the Joycon mostly? Which btw I love using
[2017-03-04 02:38:02 UTC] zawarud00: you know nintendo is sweating
[2017-03-04 02:38:10 UTC] zawarud00: if the switch faills its all over for nintendo
[2017-03-04 02:38:15 UTC] bigbadskonk: YUP
[2017-03-04 02:38:25 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm surprised at how comfortable the joycons are when not on the grip
[2017-03-04 02:38:30 UTC] skysands2017: Stuttering and it messes up when turning the device on. Joy-Con desyncing a lot. @Bigbadskonk Saudi Arabia
[2017-03-04 02:38:30 UTC] capcom_vsnk2_onlinedition: got ***
[2017-03-04 02:38:30 UTC] jmon_1985: they refuse to adapt, they need to die
[2017-03-04 02:38:34 UTC] thepastryarchy: Stoked! I've been looking forward to this all day, as dorky as that sounds.
[2017-03-04 02:38:35 UTC] ziibrah: nah they will probably survive as long as mobile games make money
[2017-03-04 02:38:36 UTC] philtheboss2367: Hi
[2017-03-04 02:38:38 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: let's just hope the thing isn't a frirea hazzard or some shit
[2017-03-04 02:38:43 UTC] doctorzzz: did you get a procontroller phil ?
[2017-03-04 02:38:47 UTC] blue_blur64: I haven't seen any stuttering
[2017-03-04 02:38:48 UTC] bbt_2017: @zawarud00 Not all over. they'll go 3rd party and become bigger than ever.
[2017-03-04 02:38:54 UTC] ziibrah: DoctorZzZ, very sure that he did not
[2017-03-04 02:39:09 UTC] pasc4l: Kappa
[2017-03-04 02:39:33 UTC] darksydephil: oh hmm
[2017-03-04 02:39:38 UTC] darksydephil: should i record at 720p? probably
[2017-03-04 02:39:41 UTC] blue_blur64: And they barely ever desync for me, I just had to move my hand a little to get it back in range and not be blocked. It's like blocking your tv remote
[2017-03-04 02:39:44 UTC] noobrydar: The Switch wont fail. Pokemon and monster hunter fans will flock in huge amounts to buy a switch just to play those games. Wii U didnt have that advantage
[2017-03-04 02:39:48 UTC] zahvone: no
[2017-03-04 02:39:50 UTC] darksydephil: no need for 1080p here. wait is the switch 1080p? i dont even know lol
[2017-03-04 02:39:58 UTC] blue_blur64: Switch is 1080p 60fps
[2017-03-04 02:39:59 UTC] vendatus: 900p
[2017-03-04 02:40:02 UTC] zawarud00: the switch about to be 360p
[2017-03-04 02:40:04 UTC] bigbadskonk: @DarksydePhil the game is only 720p so probably record at 720p
[2017-03-04 02:40:04 UTC] zawarud00: LOL
[2017-03-04 02:40:05 UTC] bbt_2017: Switch is 1080p
[2017-03-04 02:40:06 UTC] skysands2017: 720 is good
[2017-03-04 02:40:08 UTC] blue_blur64: Zelda is 900p 30fps
[2017-03-04 02:40:12 UTC] darksydephil: ill do 720p and 60fps
[2017-03-04 02:40:15 UTC] blue_blur64: When docked to be specific
[2017-03-04 02:40:16 UTC] darksydephil: so the dashboard will look good
[2017-03-04 02:40:17 UTC] bigbadskonk: yes
[2017-03-04 02:40:17 UTC] ziibrah: its not 60fps tho
[2017-03-04 02:40:19 UTC] doctorzzz: its only 30fps game
[2017-03-04 02:40:20 UTC] zahvone: switch is 1080 on the dock
[2017-03-04 02:40:21 UTC] capcom_vsnk2_onlinedition: jiyuDaigasm jiyuDaigasm
[2017-03-04 02:40:21 UTC] skysands2017: yeah. Zelda is 900p.
[2017-03-04 02:40:27 UTC] doctorzzz: mitght do 1080 30
[2017-03-04 02:40:30 UTC] zawarud00: wow so they couldnt even get zelda at 60 eh? Mario better be 60
[2017-03-04 02:40:35 UTC] doctorzzz: fot better visuals
[2017-03-04 02:40:35 UTC] blue_blur64: Well Phil you don't want to record at first because the setup starts in handheld
[2017-03-04 02:40:39 UTC] bigbadskonk: wait is zelda 900p or 720p?
[2017-03-04 02:40:41 UTC] skysands2017: BARELY 30fps
[2017-03-04 02:40:46 UTC] onorub: Well, if Phil likes streaming twitch style and decides to do it full time this is the last time i'm watching him, so might as well make a account to sit through it
[2017-03-04 02:40:49 UTC] ziibrah: yeah its 20-30fps docked
[2017-03-04 02:40:50 UTC] bbt_2017: @zawarud00 Zelda drops to 20
[2017-03-04 02:40:53 UTC] noobrydar: switch is 720p undocked and 900p while docked @DarksydePhil
[2017-03-04 02:40:53 UTC] blue_blur64: Zelda is 900p when docked
[2017-03-04 02:40:54 UTC] skysands2017: 720 undocked, 900 docked
[2017-03-04 02:41:01 UTC] alexander_rossi: xbox scorpio and ps4 pro are already doing 4K and nintendo can barely touch 1080p cmonBruh
[2017-03-04 02:41:01 UTC] zawarud00: I heard people getting massive frame drops on Wii U Zelda
[2017-03-04 02:41:12 UTC] blue_blur64: No Noob, Switch is 1080p 60fps when docked, it's just Zelda that's 900p
[2017-03-04 02:41:26 UTC] doctorzzz: switch has the same frame drops, in some areas its really bad
[2017-03-04 02:41:29 UTC] vendatus: Zelda dips alot in certain places
[2017-03-04 02:41:31 UTC] bbt_2017: @zawarud00 big drops on switch (docked only) and Wii U
[2017-03-04 02:41:41 UTC] skysands2017: Can't wait for Switch PRO Kappa
[2017-03-04 02:41:42 UTC] darksydephil: ok stream will start shortly
[2017-03-04 02:41:45 UTC] bigbadskonk: cool
[2017-03-04 02:41:46 UTC] skysands2017: You know it's gonna happen
[2017-03-04 02:41:48 UTC] blue_blur64: Honestly I don't get many drops on the Switch version when docked
[2017-03-04 02:41:49 UTC] zahvone: sweet
[2017-03-04 02:41:52 UTC] annabac: nice
[2017-03-04 02:41:55 UTC] zahvone: let me know when
[2017-03-04 02:41:58 UTC] blue_blur64: I had one bad freeze but that's it
[2017-03-04 02:42:10 UTC] blue_blur64: Maybe I'm just lucky with my Switch LUL
[2017-03-04 02:42:18 UTC] twitchnotify: 1 viewer resubscribed while you were away!
[2017-03-04 02:42:23 UTC] bigbadskonk: at least there arnt any trolls here yet
[2017-03-04 02:42:27 UTC] ziibrah: the open areas have drops to 20fps, but its not as bad as soulsborne games lol
[2017-03-04 02:42:29 UTC] annabac: so interaction is cool for stream phil, this was good
[2017-03-04 02:42:36 UTC] zahvone: yes
[2017-03-04 02:43:08 UTC] shadowmonstergaming: Hey EveryOne
[2017-03-04 02:43:12 UTC] jowey5: Sup 👋🏼👋🏼
[2017-03-04 02:43:13 UTC] nightbot: Jowey5 -> Please do not spam symbols, thanks. [warning]
[2017-03-04 02:43:13 UTC] blue_blur64: Here's basically my day 1 experience. In large patches of tall grass, the framerate can drop. But other than that, it's a silky smooth 30fps
[2017-03-04 02:43:16 UTC] skysands2017: Hey @ShadowMonsterGaming
[2017-03-04 02:43:19 UTC] kinggreen: so this will just be unboxing and setup, right?
[2017-03-04 02:43:23 UTC] blue_blur64: yes King
[2017-03-04 02:43:25 UTC] bigbadskonk: yes
[2017-03-04 02:43:27 UTC] shadowmonstergaming: I Belive So
[2017-03-04 02:43:27 UTC] iamkurla249: yep
[2017-03-04 02:43:28 UTC] kinggreen: k
[2017-03-04 02:43:28 UTC] popsicolo: Silky smooth 30fps Kreygasm
[2017-03-04 02:43:30 UTC] leokira997: >silky smooth 30fps
[2017-03-04 02:43:34 UTC] ziibrah: LOL
[2017-03-04 02:43:40 UTC] blue_blur64: It does look great though
[2017-03-04 02:43:41 UTC] shadowmonstergaming: And Hey @skysands2017
[2017-03-04 02:43:42 UTC] retroparasite: On screen bits and subs PogChamp PogChamp
[2017-03-04 02:43:45 UTC] bbt_2017: @blue_blur64 same with me big drops when fighting near a lot of tall grass
[2017-03-04 02:43:46 UTC] noobrydar: @blue_blur64, Switch is always 720p when not docked. I suspect the only games doing 1080p will be remakes of old games. I doubt true new titles will push 1080p
[2017-03-04 02:43:57 UTC] kinggreen: we talking about Zelda fps cause lol at 30fps
[2017-03-04 02:44:08 UTC] blue_blur64: Mario Odyssey is 1080p. Splatoon 2 is 1080p
[2017-03-04 02:44:10 UTC] zawarud00: fuck zelda im more hyped for 1 2 punch
[2017-03-04 02:44:12 UTC] cutelittlegirl: zelda is 20 fps when its not in portable so l o l
[2017-03-04 02:44:17 UTC] skysands2017: Dark Souls 1-2 on Switch are gonna happen
[2017-03-04 02:44:20 UTC] darksydephil: stream live for everyone?
[2017-03-04 02:44:20 UTC] snortburnell: Mario oddesey looks awful
[2017-03-04 02:44:23 UTC] blue_blur64: it is
[2017-03-04 02:44:23 UTC] zahvone: Yes
[2017-03-04 02:44:23 UTC] retroparasite: Arms fisting PogChamp
[2017-03-04 02:44:24 UTC] onorub: yep
[2017-03-04 02:44:26 UTC] kinggreen: yes
[2017-03-04 02:44:26 UTC] iamkurla249: yep
[2017-03-04 02:44:27 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: yep
[2017-03-04 02:44:32 UTC] darksydephil: ok cool ill tweet that we're live then
[2017-03-04 02:44:33 UTC] thepastryarchy: I see live
[2017-03-04 02:44:34 UTC] zahvone: Hey Phil, seriously man I do appreciate it.
[2017-03-04 02:44:36 UTC] zawarud00: Mario in GTA what on earth was Nintendo THINKING
[2017-03-04 02:44:37 UTC] bigbadskonk: @DarksydePhil yes its live phil
[2017-03-04 02:44:38 UTC] cutelittlegirl: the wiiu version is 720p like switch portable, the game has problems at 900p
[2017-03-04 02:44:39 UTC] annabac: :D
[2017-03-04 02:44:56 UTC] bbt_2017: @zawarud00 that's only the hub world
[2017-03-04 02:44:59 UTC] sakuraa98: StrawBeary
[2017-03-04 02:45:09 UTC] popsicolo: From the moment we met you could see that I was filled with desire.
[2017-03-04 02:45:10 UTC] popsicolo: Only one thing in common, ooh baby, but our love is pure fire Kreygasm
[2017-03-04 02:45:10 UTC] kinggreen: So I've been out of the loop for a few weeks, what's this about Phil losing his job?
[2017-03-04 02:45:11 UTC] blue_blur64: Tomorrow I'm gonna do a test by lowering the resolution that the console shows
[2017-03-04 02:45:15 UTC] johny_alumni: hello
[2017-03-04 02:45:26 UTC] popsicolo: It just happened last night KingGreen
[2017-03-04 02:45:35 UTC] kinggreen: reasons?
[2017-03-04 02:45:38 UTC] ziibrah: KingGreen, he is no longer contracted to machinima
[2017-03-04 02:45:41 UTC] annabac: lets turn it into a twitch job
[2017-03-04 02:45:43 UTC] blue_blur64: So instead of being automatic, I'll set it 720p and see if framedrops happen less (even though it doesn't happen much for me)
[2017-03-04 02:45:44 UTC] johny_alumni: wassup phil really excited for the switch
[2017-03-04 02:45:50 UTC] zawarud00: he finna become a full time strermer
[2017-03-04 02:46:04 UTC] theyesmovement: twitch is the way forward phil
[2017-03-04 02:46:06 UTC] gosoxtim: hey blue do think zelda is a 10/10
[2017-03-04 02:46:19 UTC] goldencolts: he finna do that fam tqbh
[2017-03-04 02:46:20 UTC] dragonjarvis: puh I did not miss it xD
[2017-03-04 02:46:21 UTC] blue_blur64: So far, I think so. I was addicted to the game
[2017-03-04 02:46:26 UTC] skooma_dealer: rolling for dud
[2017-03-04 02:46:32 UTC] kinggreen: can't be a 10/10 with constant framedrops
[2017-03-04 02:46:34 UTC] skooma_dealer: LOL rolling for BSOD
[2017-03-04 02:46:37 UTC] dragonjarvis: I played botw and totally forgot the time
[2017-03-04 02:46:38 UTC] zawarud00: Eventually the detractors will get kicked out of their mothers basement and he'll be able to go back to youtube
[2017-03-04 02:46:40 UTC] blue_blur64: It's not constant though
[2017-03-04 02:46:42 UTC] zawarud00: untill then twitch is the only way
[2017-03-04 02:46:43 UTC] kinggreen: 9.5/10 maybe
[2017-03-04 02:46:46 UTC] stinkinburrows: So, is Phil gonna be a full time streamer now?
[2017-03-04 02:46:47 UTC] blue_blur64: Again, for me it rarely happens
[2017-03-04 02:47:00 UTC] cutelittlegirl: hes going to get a SHITTY job in retail
[2017-03-04 02:47:01 UTC] torgorr: its a 10/10
[2017-03-04 02:47:02 UTC] bigbadskonk: @Stinkinburrows he is gonna try it out
[2017-03-04 02:47:03 UTC] dragonjarvis: @KingGreen I would rate it at least 9.999/10
[2017-03-04 02:47:04 UTC] eddo799: BibleThump
[2017-03-04 02:47:11 UTC] amocoru: Unboxing HYPE!
[2017-03-04 02:47:17 UTC] stinkinburrows: If he does and interacts with chat, I will sub for sure
[2017-03-04 02:47:25 UTC] noobrydar: Ad revenue on youtube is so horrible these days, that I would bet DSP could easily make more money on twitch
[2017-03-04 02:47:27 UTC] dragonjarvis: I also have some framedrops but they are rare
[2017-03-04 02:47:27 UTC] skysands2017: Yeah. Bloodborne got 9.5 and what hold it from getting a 10/10 is the framerate issue. Zelda is way worse with framerate and it got 10/10. Bloodborne is 10/10 in my heart anyway lol
[2017-03-04 02:47:30 UTC] blue_blur64: And honestly, even with framedrops, it doesn't hinder my experience at all
[2017-03-04 02:47:30 UTC] doctorzzz: Oh yeah and phil i know you dont want to, but its time to enable donations probably,
[2017-03-04 02:47:35 UTC] bigbadskonk: he says he will become more interactive withtchat
[2017-03-04 02:47:52 UTC] onorub: the depressing thing to me is that being fulltime on twitch in the most logical thing to do, taking longer to do games due to interaction is gonna lower costs
[2017-03-04 02:47:53 UTC] kinggreen: he kinda have to if he really is making this his main source of income now @Stinkinburrows
[2017-03-04 02:48:07 UTC] dragonjarvis: I love botw so far. I do exact the same thing I do in skyrim though, which is picking flowers and catching bugs xD
[2017-03-04 02:48:10 UTC] blue_blur64: Like, if it happened during combat and you weren't able to react effectively because of it, then it would be a problem. But it hasn't been yet
[2017-03-04 02:48:15 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: is there no sound or is something fuck at my end?
[2017-03-04 02:48:20 UTC] blue_blur64: Jarvis, I've done so much of that LUL
[2017-03-04 02:48:21 UTC] stinkinburrows: He would have to turn on notifications and get a shit ton of mods lol
[2017-03-04 02:48:29 UTC] echofoxtokido: 어어 나라처럼
[2017-03-04 02:48:32 UTC] the_fire_rises_: gameplay in Zelda is great. I finally found a house and it so much traversing through the world than just running around
[2017-03-04 02:48:33 UTC] trakooma: H
[2017-03-04 02:48:44 UTC] annabac: wooo
[2017-03-04 02:48:44 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: never mind. Now it is very live :)
[2017-03-04 02:48:48 UTC] bigbadskonk: Hey Phil
[2017-03-04 02:48:50 UTC] trakooma: full time streamer would be great.

[2017-03-04 02:48:58 UTC] dragonjarvis: @blue-blur64 haha but it is kinda addicting isnt it? I really like the coocking system and so on
[2017-03-04 02:49:00 UTC] jmon_1985: omg
[2017-03-04 02:49:04 UTC] trakooma: it seems that twitch is the new future
[2017-03-04 02:49:06 UTC] noobrydar: I remember watching DSP streams on twitch back in 2013 and 2014. I was furious when he stopped streaming on twitch
[2017-03-04 02:49:08 UTC] blue_blur64: I even watched Bokoblins hunt down a boar, kill it, and then eat its meat after dancing for joy LUL
[2017-03-04 02:49:10 UTC] skysands2017: ayy. Hey Phil

[2017-03-04 03:03:32 UTC] owenage55: @darksydephil in order to take twitch seriously, here's what I recommend. Work on making the quality of your stream the best it can be. So get tons of cool emotes for subs to use that revolve around you, cool sound cues when people sub/donate. allow for donations that pop up on screen and people can write messages that pop up on stream that you can see and acknowledge. cool overlays, etc.

[2017-03-04 05:19:47 UTC] agoodrpg: Yeah he did i wish he would try to change more. It would be for the better for him to have a more chill and longer stream and do irl stuff and some video game. He would't be so stressed i feel either
[2017-03-04 05:19:54 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: @Bammbino For Ice Poseidon he left his stream on and went swiming for like 20 minutes, and people were spamming racist words, this is a lot different situation, phil will be right there the whole time
[2017-03-04 05:20:00 UTC] soulrider95: I was actually looking forward to seeing him legitimately change without Machinima but oh well, guess we're back to weekly schedules and 15m Youtube videos. Dissapointing.
[2017-03-04 05:20:18 UTC] bammbino: @soulrider95, we let him know that mornings are the best times on twitch no mater what and he asked us what is the best time for EU but i canntot say since im in USA
[2017-03-04 05:20:35 UTC] sp00nerism_: @soulrider95 this
[2017-03-04 05:20:50 UTC] bammbino: so this is why i keep asking chat to give feedback
[2017-03-04 05:21:04 UTC] bammbino: better schedule, better behaviour = better entertainment for haters and fans
[2017-03-04 05:21:13 UTC] a_lern: Phil has a comfort zone he doesn't want to step too far out of... but the current situation was forcing his hand.
[2017-03-04 05:21:26 UTC] soulrider95: His stream times are ass for most people anyways, for most of America he's streaming during work and school hours. I'm busy during then, of course I'm not gonna show up
[2017-03-04 05:21:47 UTC] bammbino: @A_lern, he was in offline chat for over one hour and said he is willing to change the schedule if he doesnt need to baby sit videos uploading over night
[2017-03-04 05:21:50 UTC] oscotron: the old way wont work anymore he sees that now.he will adapt. he will change. i belive in him.
[2017-03-04 05:22:05 UTC] sp00nerism_: He was so set for twitch full time yet, oh look an email!!
[2017-03-04 05:22:08 UTC] bammbino: if he reduces DSPGAMING content then the twitch stream schedule will prolly go to 9am his time
[2017-03-04 05:22:11 UTC] sp00nerism_: Hmmmm
[2017-03-04 05:22:23 UTC] eternia_forever: nite everyone
[2017-03-04 05:22:24 UTC] sp00nerism_: really gets your noggin a joggin
[2017-03-04 05:22:31 UTC] deadshot130: damn offliine?
[2017-03-04 05:22:36 UTC] sp00nerism_: So much for twitch full streamer
[2017-03-04 05:22:38 UTC] soulrider95: Anyways I'm gonna go watch some other streamers who actually know how to do Day 1 hype, and have been playing the game all day
[2017-03-04 05:22:39 UTC] soulrider95: cya
[2017-03-04 05:22:42 UTC] sp00nerism_: back to lame schedules
[2017-03-04 05:22:47 UTC] bammbino: sp00nerism_, just wait it out my friend, keep letting him know how you feel
[2017-03-04 05:22:51 UTC] oscotron: its 6am in central EU greetings from hungray fellas
[2017-03-04 05:22:55 UTC] blue_blur64: He was never gonna change the schedule @sp00nerism_
[2017-03-04 05:22:58 UTC] sp00nerism_: I'm blocked on his twitter though
[2017-03-04 05:23:02 UTC] eternia_forever: Phil listen you need to announce cheering As they come in
[2017-03-04 05:23:03 UTC] sp00nerism_: so
[2017-03-04 05:23:03 UTC] agoodrpg: @soulrider95 Same here I'm disappointing in him :(
[2017-03-04 05:23:06 UTC] blue_blur64: And even then he's still gonna be streaming full time
[2017-03-04 05:23:07 UTC] soulrider95: Bammbino, I'd like to tell him excatly how I feel but knowing him I'd just get banned
[2017-03-04 05:23:09 UTC] bammbino: @blue_blur64, you werent here man, he said so troday
[2017-03-04 05:23:15 UTC] skysands2017: Hey. So Phil is playing Zelda tomorrow?
[2017-03-04 05:23:25 UTC] soulrider95: Yeah, two days late.
[2017-03-04 05:23:34 UTC] deadshot130: Twitch is more lucrative than YouTube so he needs to use it more
[2017-03-04 05:24:05 UTC] bammbino: we even told him that if hes positive and doesnt bash fans/viewers and game devs, he'd be getting free/early game copies
[2017-03-04 05:24:05 UTC] shimmernuts: how'd the unboxing go
[2017-03-04 05:24:10 UTC] bammbino: its just how twitch works
[2017-03-04 05:24:10 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm gonna go play more Zelda soon, but I'm gonna do a test by setting the TV resolution to 720p
[2017-03-04 05:24:12 UTC] darksydephil: hey question all!
[2017-03-04 05:24:25 UTC] darksydephil: if i put the joycons on the switch while docked over night, that's how you charge them right?
[2017-03-04 05:24:27 UTC] skysands2017: Most YouTubers went to Twitch. EpicNameBro is now fll streamer, and he uploads the footage to YT. 3 hours videos
[2017-03-04 05:24:31 UTC] blue_blur64: Correct Phil
[2017-03-04 05:24:37 UTC] skysands2017: Yeah I think
[2017-03-04 05:24:42 UTC] darksydephil: ok cool thats what im doing righ tnow then
[2017-03-04 05:24:43 UTC] bammbino: @skysands2017, im w/ you
[2017-03-04 05:24:44 UTC] blue_blur64: And the joycons have quite a long battery life
[2017-03-04 05:24:47 UTC] darksydephil: hopefully it works or ill be boned tomorrow lol
[2017-03-04 05:24:49 UTC] shimmernuts: good luck Phil, woth change comes uncertainty, but also hope
[2017-03-04 05:24:57 UTC] sp00nerism_: Phil, what happened to full time streamer
[2017-03-04 05:25:01 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, sleep well man! you had good news today
[2017-03-04 05:25:07 UTC] sp00nerism_: The whole forget YouTube attitude
[2017-03-04 05:25:11 UTC] imskobra: good luck flipping burgers at mcdonalds in 2 months phil
[2017-03-04 05:25:12 UTC] jaddf: is the stream over ?
[2017-03-04 05:25:17 UTC] skysands2017: Hey Phil. Can you mod me please? :)
[2017-03-04 05:25:19 UTC] smittenkitten95: have a great night phil
[2017-03-04 05:25:34 UTC] sp00nerism_: So much for that fuck YouTube attitude
[2017-03-04 05:25:40 UTC] agoodrpg: @DarksydePhil, I hope you read some of the chat tonight. You can learn from it how to do this full time
[2017-03-04 05:26:09 UTC] bammbino: @skysands2017, a FF14 youtuber rarely makes videos now cause twitch gets him more than 3 times what youtube gives cause of the changes
[2017-03-04 05:26:42 UTC] skysands2017: Yeah. It's fucking insane how YT screwed over the channels.
[2017-03-04 05:26:54 UTC] bammbino: its all about what goes into googles wallets
[2017-03-04 05:27:01 UTC] bammbino: i dont blame them, but man its fucked up
[2017-03-04 05:27:04 UTC] soulrider95: Running youtube isn't cheap
[2017-03-04 05:27:14 UTC] sp00nerism_: What was the point of him doing these twitch exclusive things if he is still gonna be a YouTube drone
[2017-03-04 05:27:28 UTC] bammbino: @sp00nerism_, hes not thats the point man
[2017-03-04 05:27:34 UTC] sp00nerism_: Really?
[2017-03-04 05:27:40 UTC] skysands2017: I saw a Tweet from LonelyGoomba on twitter, he males animations and video game reviews with unique style, he says " I would make more selling socks on the corner of the city than making money off of YT" LOL
[2017-03-04 05:27:43 UTC] bammbino: @sp00nerism_, he said kogaming and vlogs dont bring much income
[2017-03-04 05:27:44 UTC] sp00nerism_: him setting up the bits to appear on screen?
[2017-03-04 05:27:47 UTC] bammbino: he said so today
[2017-03-04 05:28:00 UTC] bammbino: @sp00nerism_, thats because we told him to over 1 hour
[2017-03-04 05:28:01 UTC] sp00nerism_: Huh?
[2017-03-04 05:28:13 UTC] sp00nerism_: I watched his 2 hour rant btw
[2017-03-04 05:28:16 UTC] soulrider95: Last year Youtube made a 4 billion dollar Revenue stream. It made almost 0% profit from that. Running the site isn't cheap at ALL
[2017-03-04 05:28:30 UTC] bammbino: @sp00nerism_, its after that, he was in offline chat for near 2 hours
[2017-03-04 05:28:40 UTC] bammbino: chatting with us as we told him how twitch operates
[2017-03-04 05:28:46 UTC] bammbino: and how to be successful w/ it
[2017-03-04 05:28:48 UTC] sp00nerism_: I'm saying is, he shouldn't do the shit with bits appearing on the screen if he is still gonna be on YouTube
[2017-03-04 05:29:36 UTC] bammbino: @sp00nerism_, again you are missing the point.. before this stream ended, he said "im going do to this stream intereaction with my playthrough for a month or more" to see how it goes
[2017-03-04 05:29:46 UTC] bammbino: @sp00nerism_, you saw 5% of the changes
[2017-03-04 05:29:53 UTC] skysands2017: Nah he should do that. All the YTbers now upload the videos from Twitch straight to YT with all the popups and subs and all of that
[2017-03-04 05:30:00 UTC] sp00nerism_: Mate
[2017-03-04 05:30:00 UTC] bammbino: YEP
[2017-03-04 05:30:11 UTC] bammbino: read what sky said
[2017-03-04 05:30:14 UTC] sp00nerism_: Tell me something
[2017-03-04 05:30:16 UTC] bammbino: thats phil's new plan
[2017-03-04 05:30:30 UTC] skysands2017: And I fully support that.
[2017-03-04 05:30:37 UTC] sp00nerism_: so, Phil went from exclusively all on twitch. Fuck YouTube to oh let's do both
[2017-03-04 05:30:45 UTC] sp00nerism_: You see?
[2017-03-04 05:31:04 UTC] bammbino: when you get bad news you sometimes expect the worse
[2017-03-04 05:31:06 UTC] bammbino: for example
[2017-03-04 05:31:13 UTC] skysands2017: No I don't see what you're trying to imply
[2017-03-04 05:31:34 UTC] sp00nerism_: He was acting completely different before he got that email
[2017-03-04 05:31:35 UTC] bammbino: in offline chat he said "why cant some of you get it that my youtube career might wash away if things dont work out"
[2017-03-04 05:31:46 UTC] sp00nerism_: telling him his channel got partnered
[2017-03-04 05:32:01 UTC] bammbino: and i told him "i am positivie and dont give into negativity, you will be successful using twitch and youtube together"
[2017-03-04 05:32:02 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, and it would only be side money compared to twitch
[2017-03-04 05:32:11 UTC] bammbino: blue_blur64, gets its
[2017-03-04 05:32:31 UTC] skysands2017: It's simple. Stream on Twitch, upload the archived streams here to YT, do vlogs and reviews on YT.
[2017-03-04 05:32:35 UTC] sp00nerism_: And I don't get it ?
[2017-03-04 05:32:50 UTC] bammbino: @sp00nerism_, no matter who he signs with on YT, it will be less than he ever made so he can no longer rely soleyl on dspgaming channel
[2017-03-04 05:32:57 UTC] blue_blur64: He's still going to be on twitch full time, at least for now. The YouTube videos will be able to make some extra money, but because the channel isn't partnered it won't be his main source of income
[2017-03-04 05:32:58 UTC] sp00nerism_: Yeah
[2017-03-04 05:33:03 UTC] bammbino: its stream on twitch and put vods on BOTH twitch and youtube
[2017-03-04 05:33:29 UTC] blue_blur64: And wouldn't it be better to at least make a little money on YouTube but not care about the status of the videos instead of no money on YouTube at all?
[2017-03-04 05:33:29 UTC] sp00nerism_: But I thought the yt viewers weren't gonna like the vod's
[2017-03-04 05:33:32 UTC] bammbino: we get rechat on twitch, we get just the gameplay w/ him talking to chat on YT
[2017-03-04 05:33:43 UTC] bammbino: they arent, thats the point
[2017-03-04 05:33:55 UTC] bammbino: twitch vods is better cause of chat replay
[2017-03-04 05:33:58 UTC] sp00nerism_: Yeah
[2017-03-04 05:33:58 UTC] bammbino: for example:
[2017-03-04 05:34:11 UTC] bammbino: if he talks to skysands2017 , we can read what he typed and hear phil
[2017-03-04 05:34:14 UTC] sp00nerism_: I get making twitch archives
[2017-03-04 05:34:19 UTC] bammbino: on YT, there will be a disconnect
[2017-03-04 05:34:24 UTC] sp00nerism_: but uploading twitch vod's to YouTube?
[2017-03-04 05:34:38 UTC] bammbino: well all streamers do it w/ success
[2017-03-04 05:34:46 UTC] bammbino: look up datguylirik on youtube
[2017-03-04 05:34:53 UTC] bammbino: 30-75k views per vid
[2017-03-04 05:34:56 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, most people do the same thing as what we're describing
[2017-03-04 05:35:07 UTC] sp00nerism_: Radbrad gets like a million on each vid
[2017-03-04 05:35:20 UTC] sp00nerism_: gets shit hella early
[2017-03-04 05:35:24 UTC] bammbino: the only thing you're seeing different spoon is that phil is FINALLY listening to us and adopting a plan that works
[2017-03-04 05:35:26 UTC] sp00nerism_: It's like come on now
[2017-03-04 05:35:36 UTC] sp00nerism_: Getting games two weeks early
[2017-03-04 05:35:38 UTC] bammbino: hes giving up on his old ways as they dont work in 2017
[2017-03-04 05:35:53 UTC] blue_blur64: Just look up BrownMan and Nappythegreat on youtube. All of BrownMan's videos are just twitch archives and highlights. Nappy's videos are normally directly from twitch and those get plenty of views
[2017-03-04 05:35:54 UTC] bammbino: @sp00nerism_, i hammered that part to him with others
[2017-03-04 05:36:08 UTC] bammbino: he has to stop bashing gaming devs and they'll be open to sending him copies
[2017-03-04 05:36:20 UTC] bammbino: bash the game, not the makers
[2017-03-04 05:36:24 UTC] bammbino: thats how the world works
[2017-03-04 05:36:38 UTC] sp00nerism_: Yeah it's cause he bashes devs
[2017-03-04 05:36:54 UTC] sp00nerism_: you can't give a free game to a dude, and then hear. The devs are fucking morons
[2017-03-04 05:36:59 UTC] bammbino: yep and if he takes our feedback hey may start getting free/early copies
[2017-03-04 05:37:17 UTC] bammbino: the only thing is, he wont be managed anymore
[2017-03-04 05:37:29 UTC] sp00nerism_: Shame he's playing Nier
[2017-03-04 05:37:32 UTC] sp00nerism_: that sucks
[2017-03-04 05:37:41 UTC] bammbino: he'll have a partnership for revenue and thats it, hes gonna have to work himself to get games
[2017-03-04 05:37:55 UTC] skysands2017: Hope the best for Phil.
[2017-03-04 05:38:07 UTC] sp00nerism_: He dropped wild lands cause why?
[2017-03-04 05:38:11 UTC] bammbino: nier.. yes he'll be what 3 weeks late? but we still want to see him play it and how he reacts to it
[2017-03-04 05:38:17 UTC] sp00nerism_: i thought he had whole coop team
[2017-03-04 05:38:18 UTC] eddo799: Had a good run on youtube BibleThump
[2017-03-04 05:38:20 UTC] bammbino: the game is hard sp00nerism_so you will see rage
[2017-03-04 05:38:33 UTC] skysands2017: Nier is hard?
[2017-03-04 05:38:39 UTC] skysands2017: Played the demo, it wasn't that hard
[2017-03-04 05:38:40 UTC] sp00nerism_: He'll just talk about 2b's ass the whole time
[2017-03-04 05:38:41 UTC] bammbino: yes lol
[2017-03-04 05:38:44 UTC] sp00nerism_: lame man,
[2017-03-04 05:38:50 UTC] sp00nerism_: oh look her ass!
[2017-03-04 05:38:54 UTC] skysands2017: Who doesn't talk about 2B's ass?
[2017-03-04 05:39:03 UTC] sp00nerism_: Well, he will do it every second
[2017-03-04 05:39:05 UTC] bammbino: @skyfx89, watch cohh carnage start to nier he instantly died and had to do the whole intro all over
[2017-03-04 05:39:07 UTC] sp00nerism_: like everything

[2017-03-04 05:39:43 UTC] sp00nerism_: all he talks about
[2017-03-04 05:39:54 UTC] skysands2017: @Bammbino really? He must be playing at highest difficulty. The demo was kind easy on Normal.
[2017-03-04 05:40:07 UTC] bammbino: i think the difficulty under the highest
[2017-03-04 05:40:25 UTC] bammbino: his face was PRICELESS when he started over
[2017-03-04 05:40:29 UTC] sp00nerism_: @skysands2029, you know that I know that he knows. He'll just move the camera to look up her skirt
[2017-03-04 05:40:38 UTC] sp00nerism_: guarantee
[2017-03-04 05:40:39 UTC] skysands2017: Man. This first quarter of 2017 lol. Spent so much of video games
[2017-03-04 05:40:50 UTC] sp00nerism_: I'm putting 50 large

[2017-03-04 05:41:03 UTC] bammbino: RDR2? like are you kidding me?
[2017-03-04 05:41:05 UTC] sp00nerism_: 50 g's that he will look up her skirt
[2017-03-04 05:41:13 UTC] sp00nerism_: Who wants to bet boys
[2017-03-04 05:41:22 UTC] sp00nerism_: Come on
[2017-03-04 05:41:23 UTC] skysands2017: @sp00nerism_ lol 2B will hit the camera and it'll change if you try to look under her skirt
[2017-03-04 05:41:24 UTC] codenameone: I'll take that bet.
[2017-03-04 05:41:37 UTC] sp00nerism_: You do know the explosion thing sky right
[2017-03-04 05:41:52 UTC] skysands2017: Not really. What about it?
[2017-03-04 05:42:04 UTC] sp00nerism_: You self explode or whatever and her butt isn't hidden anymore
[2017-03-04 05:42:23 UTC] sp00nerism_: Just half leotard with her butt hanging out
[2017-03-04 05:42:38 UTC] bammbino: sky, you edit some vids for phil right?
[2017-03-04 05:42:51 UTC] sp00nerism_: I'd post a link but just lookup Nier self explode or whatever
[2017-03-04 05:43:03 UTC] skysands2017: That's great. I saw a Japanese dev who told his followers to collect all of 2B sexy fanarts in a zip and send it to him. They did
[2017-03-04 05:43:15 UTC] skysands2017: @Bammbino yeah
[2017-03-04 05:43:21 UTC] sp00nerism_: Yeah that's the dev

[2017-03-04 05:46:45 UTC] skysands2017: Great video, @Bammbino I might try to edit the videos with this style
[2017-03-04 05:47:23 UTC] bammbino: hope it helps, maybe you can be an editor for phil or famous streamers one day
[2017-03-04 05:47:59 UTC] bammbino: some of the guys that edit for LoL streamers started with nothing but an idea how to make an edited video twitch styled
[2017-03-04 05:48:07 UTC] sp00nerism_: Bamb
[2017-03-04 05:48:13 UTC] bammbino: sup man
[2017-03-04 05:48:15 UTC] sp00nerism_: look up Nier self destruct
[2017-03-04 05:48:34 UTC] bammbino: i dont wanna spoil too much, waiting for my copy and phil to stream it
[2017-03-04 05:48:51 UTC] sp00nerism_: Google this Nier: Automata | HOW TO BE A PERVERT :P (Easy Way)
[2017-03-04 05:48:52 UTC] bammbino: last time i spoiled myself i ended up buying mgs5 and quitting 3min in
[2017-03-04 05:49:05 UTC] sp00nerism_: Just watch that vid, sooilsvnothing
[2017-03-04 05:49:13 UTC] sp00nerism_: spoils
[2017-03-04 05:49:39 UTC] skysands2017: My cousin is so salty about MGS5 that he quit video games in general. Massive MGS fan, but was dissapointed with MGS5
[2017-03-04 05:49:56 UTC] bammbino: LOL
[2017-03-04 05:50:00 UTC] bammbino: just saw it
[2017-03-04 05:50:36 UTC] sp00nerism_: See
[2017-03-04 05:51:00 UTC] bammbino: i know i said death stranding will bomb, but after seeing horizon zero dawn/killzones new decima engine... i can safely say that kojima will do fine
[2017-03-04 05:51:06 UTC] skysands2017: Nier will make so much buzz in the west for being too sexual. Just like DoA did
[2017-03-04 05:51:27 UTC] bammbino: kjoima games are all about the engine.. thats what takes him the longst
[2017-03-04 05:51:36 UTC] bammbino: since hes using their engine, the game wont take 10 years
[2017-03-04 05:51:51 UTC] skysands2017: He's using Guerilla's engine, no?
[2017-03-04 05:51:57 UTC] bammbino: yep
[2017-03-04 05:52:26 UTC] skysands2017: I'm baffled at how beautiful Horizon looked.
[2017-03-04 05:52:31 UTC] bammbino: i didnt think horizon will keep up w/ the 30fps
[2017-03-04 05:52:36 UTC] skysands2017: Great engine to use.
[2017-03-04 05:52:38 UTC] bammbino: nioh? under 30dps
[2017-03-04 05:52:41 UTC] bammbino: ffxv? 15fps
[2017-03-04 05:52:46 UTC] noko4dayz: boi
[2017-03-04 05:53:03 UTC] bammbino: guerilla won me back
[2017-03-04 05:53:06 UTC] sp00nerism_: Yeah, but you got that ugly cyborg ginger
[2017-03-04 05:53:07 UTC] bammbino: shadowfall was ass
[2017-03-04 05:53:21 UTC] skysands2017: Speaking of Nioh, haven't they said that there's going to be a PvP arena?
[2017-03-04 05:53:24 UTC] sp00nerism_: who names a kid aloy
[2017-03-04 05:53:27 UTC] bammbino: april
[2017-03-04 05:53:29 UTC] skysands2017: Or is this in a future update?
[2017-03-04 05:53:44 UTC] bammbino: its in the future cause of how the game is structured
[2017-03-04 05:53:45 UTC] skysands2017: Oh
[2017-03-04 05:53:50 UTC] sp00nerism_: obviouslu aloy is a cyborg
[2017-03-04 05:53:52 UTC] bammbino: thats why you cant do beginning to end co-op
[2017-03-04 05:54:01 UTC] sp00nerism_: I mean her name is ALOY
[2017-03-04 05:54:02 UTC] bammbino: matchmaking was done differently for quality
[2017-03-04 05:54:15 UTC] sp00nerism_: what else is there to say
[2017-03-04 05:54:29 UTC] bammbino: she was named by a random outcast lol
[2017-03-04 05:54:36 UTC] sp00nerism_: huh
[2017-03-04 05:54:42 UTC] skysands2017: I'm still getting back to Souls games. Nioh was good, but wasn't that great.
[2017-03-04 05:54:44 UTC] bammbino: Rost isnt her dad
[2017-03-04 05:54:49 UTC] sp00nerism_: Who is he
[2017-03-04 05:55:00 UTC] bammbino: he was an outcast before she was born
[2017-03-04 05:55:05 UTC] bammbino: aloy has a real mother
[2017-03-04 05:55:11 UTC] bammbino: you find out 3hours in
[2017-03-04 05:55:16 UTC] sp00nerism_: How is she a cyborg then

[2017-03-04 05:55:23 UTC] blue_blur64: wtf I just got attacked by a random ninja in Zelda O_o
[2017-03-04 05:55:27 UTC] bammbino: she bleeds and all
[2017-03-04 05:55:38 UTC] sp00nerism_: Well I'm just saying what someone wrote
[2017-03-04 05:55:43 UTC] skysands2017: Nintendo's Ninjas
[2017-03-04 05:55:48 UTC] sp00nerism_: who knows if he is memeung
[2017-03-04 05:56:04 UTC] bammbino: blue_blur64, you make me sick! 1.1k wanted to keep seeing zelda on this channel.. phil goes off and you dont stream zelda for us???
[2017-03-04 05:56:07 UTC] sp00nerism_: but I believe aloy is a cyborg

[2017-03-04 05:56:25 UTC] bammbino: EU internet?

[2017-03-04 05:56:51 UTC] bammbino: an oldie lol
[2017-03-04 05:57:00 UTC] skysands2017: I wish I had good internet, but Saudi Arabia has the worst internet I guess.. Would stream for hours :(
[2017-03-04 05:57:08 UTC] blue_blur64: well I beat the ninja and I got a sickle O_o

[2017-03-04 18:43:39 UTC] lvlpower: @myfellowjohnson I miss the launch of the switch BibleThump
[2017-03-04 18:44:07 UTC] myfellowjohnson: watching some zelda on youtube...looks so damn cozy! Too bad I don't want to buy a whole new console for just one game though :/ my economy doesn't allow it
[2017-03-04 18:44:25 UTC] betheboom: you can buy it on the wii u though
[2017-03-04 18:44:48 UTC] myfellowjohnson: Yeah but all the stores have discontinued the Wii U :( I don't have it*

[2017-03-04 18:46:20 UTC] yacherdy: That was a good PT
[2017-03-04 18:46:21 UTC] betheboom: that is a good game rick
[2017-03-04 18:46:27 UTC] failystone: My eyes require 60fps, do you think a child would find 30 okay?
[2017-03-04 18:46:27 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: getting prepped for andromeds

[2017-03-04 18:47:43 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: i missed the rpg elements of 1
[2017-03-04 18:47:48 UTC] yacherdy: same @RickGrimesFan123
[2017-03-04 18:48:05 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :( I missed the good news at the end of the stream yesterday is Phil out of the woods now?
[2017-03-04 18:48:09 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: im glad Andromeda is bringing some of that back.
[2017-03-04 18:48:17 UTC] deltaforce355: looks like phil content will "improve" on how phil is pressing the stop record button
[2017-03-04 18:48:18 UTC] yacherdy: I don't think he revealed it @theycallmejimbob

[2017-03-04 18:48:53 UTC] betheboom: jimbob ahahhhaha man u 1-1 against bournemouth
[2017-03-04 18:49:17 UTC] blue_blur64: power, what?
[2017-03-04 18:49:20 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he remind me of Professor Farnsworth with the "Good news everyone" all the time

[2017-03-04 18:49:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :( we were awful today betheboom
[2017-03-04 18:49:37 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: i think i read that zelda runs at 900p 30fps docked
[2017-03-04 18:49:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey olly
[2017-03-04 18:49:50 UTC] blue_blur64: @lvlpower, what are you talking about? xD
[2017-03-04 18:49:50 UTC] betheboom: a draw with bournmouth yes you were awful
[2017-03-04 18:49:54 UTC] ollyorange: if nothing else switch could be the best handheld ever
[2017-03-04 18:49:58 UTC] blue_blur64: and correct rick
[2017-03-04 18:50:00 UTC] yacherdy: 30fps? Obviously a shit game. Kappa
[2017-03-04 18:50:08 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I seen a comparison vid between the switch and wii u version nothing too dramatic in the difference
[2017-03-04 18:50:50 UTC] blue_blur64: well Zelda Switch version is a port
[2017-03-04 18:50:53 UTC] yacherdy: Here's my thing. Why doesn't Nintendo focus on a console that run 1080p and 60fps for all games in 2017?
[2017-03-04 18:51:18 UTC] blue_blur64: Because graphics aren't everything?
[2017-03-04 18:51:23 UTC] lvlpower: @blue_blur64 you know that the amiibos are only four as a to play playable characters or to unlock skins for your vehicles in Mario Kart
[2017-03-04 18:51:36 UTC] yacherdy: Agreed @blue_blur64 but it is 2017
[2017-03-04 18:51:50 UTC] yacherdy: maybe people don't want to play in 900p or whatever
[2017-03-04 18:51:53 UTC] blue_blur64: uh, the amiibos don't unlock playable characters
[2017-03-04 18:51:56 UTC] lvlpower: @blue_blur64 the extended version of Mario Kart 8 it's the same version as
[2017-03-04 18:51:56 UTC] deltaforce355: same logic as everything needs to be 60FPS
[2017-03-04 18:52:11 UTC] deltaforce355: not every game needs 60FPS
[2017-03-04 18:52:22 UTC] failystone: What games would be very fun to see play with heightened interactivity?
[2017-03-04 18:52:25 UTC] blue_blur64: And it's not completely the same version, as MK8 Deluxe has an actual battle mode
[2017-03-04 18:52:39 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: telltale games
[2017-03-04 18:52:45 UTC] yacherdy: Well, all I know is the experience is dramatically different on PC if it's not at least 60 fps
[2017-03-04 18:52:59 UTC] deltaforce355: if people want 60FPS all the time
[2017-03-04 18:53:06 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: Qauntic dream games
[2017-03-04 18:53:07 UTC] failystone: I was thinking about having small discussions about choice heavy games or something :P
[2017-03-04 18:53:09 UTC] deltaforce355: they should go to PC
[2017-03-04 18:53:24 UTC] lvlpower: @blue_blur64 dspSurpriseddsp Whaat I thought that's what the amiibi do when you scan amiibo you get to unlock Extra hidden content in the game
[2017-03-04 18:53:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: betheboom, you thirsty so and so
[2017-03-04 18:53:34 UTC] betheboom: jimbob say what?
[2017-03-04 18:53:35 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: i dont know when Detroit become human comes out though.
[2017-03-04 18:53:36 UTC] blue_blur64: the amiibo only unlock mii skins lol
[2017-03-04 18:53:44 UTC] yacherdy: So...while the gameplay/story is most important, FPS and game performance should matter somewhat in 2017
[2017-03-04 18:53:46 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I agree deltaforce it is a bit stupid complaining about underperforming consoles when you can get a gaming pc
[2017-03-04 18:53:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I wonder why you're watching that stream hmmmm betheboom
[2017-03-04 18:53:55 UTC] yacherdy: But people are blinded by nostalgia

[2017-03-04 19:00:41 UTC] blue_blur64: Well I just a test and the console goes pretty quick with turning itself back off if you don't press anything

[2017-03-04 19:02:25 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: There is a chance that the console has frozen with a black screen. Look at the console in a darkened room and see if any light is coming from the screen. If so, the console has frozen. Hold the POWER Button for 12 seconds or more to turn the console off.
[2017-03-04 19:02:43 UTC] failystone: Try and press the power button 15 seconds, the release, and then press it normally one time
[2017-03-04 19:02:49 UTC] dreadnaut12: or bugged switch mechanics?
[2017-03-04 19:02:52 UTC] sardarkh: Already bugged mechanics?

[2017-03-04 19:03:13 UTC] 0megaj0ker: guess the Switch really is a tablet when it freezes

[2017-03-04 19:11:02 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: it doesn't have like a hard reset button or something?
[2017-03-04 19:11:03 UTC] boxman222: DarksydePhil: do you know if it actually charged at all?? maybe somehow it was drained instead?
[2017-03-04 19:11:15 UTC] blue_blur64: Well it's supposed to only be on for a few seconds before it turns back off from my test
[2017-03-04 19:11:29 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Great what now lol TriHard /
[2017-03-04 19:11:30 UTC] kinggreen: maybe it didn't charge last night
[2017-03-04 19:11:38 UTC] theycallmejimbob: did he see RickGrimesFan123 message about holding the power button for 12 secs?
[2017-03-04 19:11:38 UTC] thedoctor5437: @DarksydePhil guess the charging overnight was too much for the battery to handle , it seems to be what might be going on
[2017-03-04 19:11:39 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Knuckles Oh-No! is the perfect description on whats happening to Phil's Switch
[2017-03-04 19:11:42 UTC] boxman222: i wonder how it would behave if battery was "empty"
[2017-03-04 19:11:44 UTC] oscotron: combination of button pressed to safe mode like phone or something
[2017-03-04 19:11:46 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: yes he saw it
[2017-03-04 19:11:47 UTC] yacherdy: I wonder if he docked it correctly.
[2017-03-04 19:11:52 UTC] sardarkh: Well, we already know that nintendo doesn't like streamers. They just went the extra mile with Phil.
[2017-03-04 19:12:05 UTC] bbt_2017: Try plugging the charger into the switch while it's in handheld mode see if it turns on
[2017-03-04 19:12:06 UTC] kinggreen: Phil, try using a usb-c to charge the Switch.
[2017-03-04 19:12:08 UTC] aglet57: Hey Twitch
[2017-03-04 19:12:17 UTC] deltaforce355: inb4 the switch wasnt charged at all

[2017-03-04 19:12:20 UTC] sonsofkojima1: hi aglet :_
[2017-03-04 19:12:23 UTC] akioartorius: hold the power button for 12 secs and then after it is turned off press the button again after 5 secs
[2017-03-04 19:12:25 UTC] darksydephil: what the hell is a usb-c
[2017-03-04 19:12:27 UTC] bbt_2017: then reconnect it to the dock
[2017-03-04 19:12:32 UTC] oscotron: @kinggreen that could be a good test
[2017-03-04 19:12:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bad news AGLET57 Phil's switch has met its maker :(
[2017-03-04 19:12:37 UTC] blue_blur64: It's what you use for your PS4 controller
[2017-03-04 19:12:50 UTC] blue_blur64: At least I think
[2017-03-04 19:12:50 UTC] dinohans: phil can you use twitch another electro socket
[2017-03-04 19:12:55 UTC] oscotron: usb cable
[2017-03-04 19:12:57 UTC] aglet57: ALREADY? Wow
[2017-03-04 19:13:01 UTC] kinggreen: take out the switch from the dock and look at the bottom for the charge port
[2017-03-04 19:13:08 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: A usb C is the new usb type
[2017-03-04 19:13:08 UTC] mrviews: are you full time twitch now philbert?
[2017-03-04 19:13:14 UTC] podusmonens: faster usb port Phil I can't believe you dont know these things
[2017-03-04 19:13:18 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: much better than regular usb
[2017-03-04 19:13:23 UTC] aglet57: That sucks
[2017-03-04 19:13:26 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Hope Phil can return it for a new one if it really is bricked
[2017-03-04 19:13:27 UTC] bbt_2017: what @kinggreen said @darksydephil

[2017-03-04 19:14:06 UTC] donniedarksouls: all of them
[2017-03-04 19:14:10 UTC] kinggreen: It's the same cable the PS4 controller uses @DarksydePhil
[2017-03-04 19:14:16 UTC] soulrider95: DarksydePhil, the switch does
[2017-03-04 19:14:20 UTC] boxman222: alot of new technology uses it now
[2017-03-04 19:14:20 UTC] popsicolo: Corporations aren't people, I don't care what CEOs tell you.
[2017-03-04 19:14:22 UTC] soulrider95: KingGreen, the ps4 uses microB still
[2017-03-04 19:14:26 UTC] oscotron: my samsung phone uses that
[2017-03-04 19:14:27 UTC] boxman222: should be able to find a cheap charger or a powerbank that has it
[2017-03-04 19:14:29 UTC] kinggreen: oh?
[2017-03-04 19:14:36 UTC] yacherdy: Everything used USB-c nowadays
[2017-03-04 19:14:36 UTC] kinggreen: nevermind then
[2017-03-04 19:14:39 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: The law says it, Popsicolo.

[2017-03-04 19:15:04 UTC] ambervisage: LOL
[2017-03-04 19:15:06 UTC] bbt_2017: @darksydephil unplug the USB charger from the dock you plugged in during set up put it directly into the switch while it's out of the dock turn it on then dock it again
[2017-03-04 19:15:07 UTC] akioartorius: where is the nearest store Phil? You could prob buy it for cheap if it is what I think it is

[2017-03-04 19:15:38 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Delta just got his foot shot for that :D
[2017-03-04 19:15:42 UTC] thedoctor5437: a few unlucky customers are bound to end up with units that are defective in some way. It’s also difficult to get a sense of how widespread the individual issues are.

[2017-03-04 19:16:05 UTC] garlicshrimp: all apple cables are proprietary stuff they wouldnt want anything to be universal

[2017-03-04 19:16:23 UTC] boxman222: i say head to a store get a usb-c charger and see if it is the switch itself or the docking charging that is defective
[2017-03-04 19:16:29 UTC] beatles12335: Man phil...I dunno what to say, im not seeing another case like this anywhere :/

[2017-03-04 19:16:40 UTC] oscotron: how about try charging it through the ps4. i do that with my phone
[2017-03-04 19:16:41 UTC] boxman222: if it is just docking station you might at least be able to use it until you get a new one
[2017-03-04 19:16:43 UTC] aglet57: Call support. They'll know what to do
[2017-03-04 19:16:45 UTC] freshjiivetv: Oh :/
[2017-03-04 19:16:45 UTC] sonsofkojima1: order a usc c off amazon after the stream i guess

[2017-03-04 19:16:59 UTC] aglet57: Maybe the Switch needs more amiibos lol
[2017-03-04 19:17:01 UTC] podusmonens: Some users have found their console won't turn on. Besides the obvious flat battery, which we're sure you've already thought of, your next option is hard reset. Here's what Nintendo says:"There is a chance that the console has frozen with a black screen. Look at the console in a darkened room and see if any light is coming from the screen. If so, the console has frozen. Hold the POWER Button for 12 seconds or more to turn the console off.
[2017-03-04 19:17:02 UTC] donniedarksouls: calm down phil hes just trying to help

[2017-03-04 19:17:10 UTC] yacherdy: Well, gotta go guys. Good luck with the Switch, Phil.
[2017-03-04 19:17:10 UTC] chowb321: can anyone give me a tldr on whats going on?
[2017-03-04 19:17:10 UTC] podusmonens: apparently it's a common problem

[2017-03-04 19:18:29 UTC] akioartorius: @DarksydePhil , either hold the power button down for 12 secs and then press the button again after 5 secs after it turns off OR go to a nearby electronic store and buy the USB-C for cheap. maybe 10 bucks
[2017-03-04 19:18:32 UTC] garlicshrimp: so is he gonna hard reset his switch?

[2017-03-04 19:19:27 UTC] bigbadskonk: it's because he licked the cartridge lol
[2017-03-04 19:19:31 UTC] sardarkh: 360 at least had the RRoD causing all that crap
[2017-03-04 19:19:32 UTC] boxman222: the other optioin would be to screw the switch all together and just play the wii u version ;P graphics are near identical besides the low res and so is the frame rates.. both drop down to 20fps in certain areas according to digitalfoundry
[2017-03-04 19:19:35 UTC] jacob1971: Anyone know if Phil plugged the dock into the wall for it to charge?

[2017-03-04 19:21:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey skysands2017
[2017-03-04 19:21:45 UTC] thedoctor5437: phil said it does turn on for a second so that means it does have power, but if anyone here knows certain reasons why it wont stay on, pls say
[2017-03-04 19:21:45 UTC] podusmonens: I saw the video guys :P
[2017-03-04 19:21:56 UTC] bammbino: just stick to DS nintendo and let the big boys make home consoles
[2017-03-04 19:21:59 UTC] thedoctor5437: when its in the dock
[2017-03-04 19:22:04 UTC] skysands2017: That's really unfortunate. The Switch gets bricked because of over-charging?
[2017-03-04 19:22:10 UTC] zawarud00: I think the obvious should be stated. Is it plugged in?
[2017-03-04 19:22:10 UTC] bbt_2017: @thedoctor5437 low battery
[2017-03-04 19:22:14 UTC] podusmonens: and yea phil has tons of dust
[2017-03-04 19:22:26 UTC] thedoctor5437: @bbt_2017 he charged it already
[2017-03-04 19:22:29 UTC] theheartless09: If it is bricked then that is a huge problem for the console.
[2017-03-04 19:22:32 UTC] aglet57: I was hype for this stream. This sucks.
[2017-03-04 19:22:33 UTC] bammbino: @thedoctor5437, that sounds like ps4's bricking issue but you get a beep and a blue light
[2017-03-04 19:22:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: that cable management too podusmonens NotLikeThis
[2017-03-04 19:22:37 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: well this is what happens before nintendo becomes a software developer only one would think
[2017-03-04 19:22:39 UTC] theheartless09: Does anyone else have an issue with charging it.
[2017-03-04 19:22:44 UTC] bigbadskonk: Phil should live stream this, if his switch isn't in a million pieces already
[2017-03-04 19:22:45 UTC] oscotron: its impossble to overcharge it. cos thats a fire hazzard imo.
[2017-03-04 19:22:48 UTC] bbt_2017: @thedoctor5437 The switch drains power while docked
[2017-03-04 19:22:55 UTC] chowb321: i have no issues, had my switch for 3 days now
[2017-03-04 19:22:58 UTC] bbt_2017: while on
[2017-03-04 19:22:58 UTC] mxtt10589: he's planning to live stream the issue, new tweet
[2017-03-04 19:23:09 UTC] zawarud00: Sounds like it never charged not that its bricked
[2017-03-04 19:23:13 UTC] charizard545: dspWowdude
[2017-03-04 19:23:14 UTC] oscotron: man turn on the stream communicate with us
[2017-03-04 19:23:21 UTC] dreadnaut12: try sticking it up your ass phil
[2017-03-04 19:23:22 UTC] mxtt10589: he's about to
[2017-03-04 19:23:22 UTC] beatles12335: has anyone else experianced this?
[2017-03-04 19:23:29 UTC] skysands2017: I was doubting people who said the Switch was rushed, but now I can see that. It was rushed and there are many issues with it
[2017-03-04 19:23:36 UTC] aglet57: Someone let me know when he's live. I'm on iOS and might need to reboot the app
[2017-03-04 19:23:37 UTC] garlicshrimp: is there going to be a prestream for the unbriccking
[2017-03-04 19:23:37 UTC] bbt_2017: It seems like a charging issue that's why I want him to mobile charge it
[2017-03-04 19:23:38 UTC] chowb321: playing on my switch right now. did he put it to sleep mode or did he actually turn it off?
[2017-03-04 19:23:40 UTC] bammbino: idk after stream phil came to offline chat and asked us about charging it
[2017-03-04 19:23:44 UTC] thedoctor5437: @bbt_2017 he did say he charged it overnight with it docked so could it be that it basically did nothing?
[2017-03-04 19:23:45 UTC] twitchnotify: 1 viewer resubscribed while you were away!
[2017-03-04 19:23:46 UTC] zawarud00: Nintendo had to rush it they were losing so much money off the wii U

[2017-03-04 19:23:55 UTC] xxxxxs3ph1r0th420xxxxx: Quite literally nothing he could do
[2017-03-04 19:23:58 UTC] mxtt10589: he turned off all sleep modes during the set up
[2017-03-04 19:24:05 UTC] doctorzzz: shouldnt have licked the cartridge
[2017-03-04 19:24:11 UTC] freshjiivetv: bugged switch mechanics.

[2017-03-04 19:24:18 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: hahhaa doctorzzz
[2017-03-04 19:24:18 UTC] skysands2017: Some say Wii U was profitable from the Amiibos, eshop and all of that.
[2017-03-04 19:24:22 UTC] bbt_2017: @thedoctor5437 if it was slightly positioned incorrectly it won't charge right in the dock
[2017-03-04 19:24:22 UTC] a_lern: is that what did it... the cartridge licking?
[2017-03-04 19:24:23 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: if that is what did it i am going to die

[2017-03-04 19:24:41 UTC] zawarud00: It never charged LOL
[2017-03-04 19:24:47 UTC] zawarud00: I dont think he docked it correctly

[2017-03-04 19:24:48 UTC] aglet57: Wait it was on all night?
[2017-03-04 19:24:49 UTC] kinggreen: He did turn sleep mode iff
[2017-03-04 19:24:54 UTC] myfellowjohnson: Nintendo fucking sucks
[2017-03-04 19:24:55 UTC] theheartless09: Horizon it is I guess...
[2017-03-04 19:25:01 UTC] mxtt10589: he kept it docked all night though
[2017-03-04 19:25:04 UTC] jonthemon94: switch is already bugged
[2017-03-04 19:25:08 UTC] charizard545: maybe he just doesnt want to play zelda
[2017-03-04 19:25:09 UTC] doctorzzz: try pluggin in the DC adapter directly to the switch and not the dock
[2017-03-04 19:25:09 UTC] chowb321: it probly never charged, put it back in the dock and wait for 3 hours. thats how long it takes to charge
[2017-03-04 19:25:10 UTC] akioartorius: Horizon Zero Dawn today huh
[2017-03-04 19:25:10 UTC] bigbadskonk: wait so is the battery just dead is that it?

[2017-03-04 19:25:25 UTC] mxtt10589: he was looking forward to zelda though
[2017-03-04 19:25:27 UTC] stuart360: Nintendo lol
[2017-03-04 19:25:31 UTC] dreadnaut12: lol me too
[2017-03-04 19:25:31 UTC] chowb321: or use the usb c connector to the console itself
[2017-03-04 19:25:31 UTC] jonthemon94: ill write it, and well do it live
[2017-03-04 19:25:33 UTC] kinggreen: Did he turn it off though? if it kept it on it still drains
[2017-03-04 19:25:35 UTC] epik1000: bad switching mechanics
[2017-03-04 19:25:40 UTC] theheartless09: He should have played it last night when he had the chance :P
[2017-03-04 19:25:43 UTC] bbt_2017: @mxtt10589 It drains power anyway unless you hold the power button at the top and select power off when it's on
[2017-03-04 19:25:44 UTC] beatles12335: Im sure we can figure this out. this is too much of a dilemma for it to just be faulty hardware (I think and hope)
[2017-03-04 19:25:44 UTC] xxxxxs3ph1r0th420xxxxx: Maybe take this as an inspiration and start a new job as video game console mechanic? XD
[2017-03-04 19:25:48 UTC] bammbino: @epik1000, not bad.. BUGGED

[2017-03-04 19:30:51 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The fact they already have a fix out to tell you what to do makes me think they knew this issue was there and didn't fix it in time
[2017-03-04 19:30:54 UTC] boxman222: DarksydePhil: that is why i suspect it might not charge properly.. why i would try with a usb-c charger

[2017-03-04 19:31:03 UTC] darksydephil: there is no number on the box. support is 100% online and after you answer a few questions it makes you create a service ticket

[2017-03-04 21:41:01 UTC] ellder_sage: @CTE900 I just can't enjoy a game based around survival when i am pulling infinite ammo out of my ass. Some loss of realism for the sake of fun is fine but when my character can take 4 point black shotgun blasts or carry 99 potions it just makes me lose interest

[2017-03-04 22:22:49 UTC] sipuli91: @amplifyed exactly. everyone was trying to make ps4 and xbone sound like they are all broken when some units were shipped broken. all electronics just are like that, some will break in no time or be broken the moment you get them
[2017-03-04 22:22:54 UTC] codenameone: Phil gave Microsoft plenty of shit for the 360's durability. He's had 8, according to him. He's also shat on MS this entire gen, rightfully so, for the Xboner.
[2017-03-04 22:23:07 UTC] djruno1: @Ginosaji48 that moment was so great

[2017-03-04 22:46:43 UTC] wolflink659: This game reminds me of Killzone: Shadow Fall. Not because of the same game engine, but because of the repetitiveness in the storyline.

I think because you are being forced to try different things you might be able to overcome your imperfections. Just enjoy yourself and be respectful of people who take time out of their life to spend it with you.
