[2017-03-01 04:57:04 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: hes addressed that already

[2017-03-01 04:58:09 UTC] eternia_forever: twitch does not take any of donations from Phil but we get taxed 30 % when buying bits cost 7 dollars to buy 5 dollars in bits
[2017-03-01 04:58:10 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: he can easily have 2 paypals one for business and one for personal I have that for my freelancing work which I have to pay taxes on
[2017-03-01 04:58:15 UTC] yacherdy: I don't know why the sloth is cross eyed but just go with it.

[2017-03-01 04:59:13 UTC] yacherdy: Probably Mountain Dew Kickstart
[2017-03-01 04:59:20 UTC] 0megaj0ker: just learned the Chinese version of Yakuza 0 has Sam Lee as Lao Gui, including his voice :D

[2017-03-01 19:01:21 UTC] yacherdy: Last night's stream was mostly side quest gameplay and Phil seemed to rush through it and not enjoy it. I personally enjoyed the gameplay, though. That's just me.
[2017-03-01 19:02:01 UTC] yacherdy: And only 170 people in attendance.
[2017-03-01 19:02:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: It's a slow burner so far but I thought the same about Nioh and look how that turned out
[2017-03-01 19:02:21 UTC] shotinthedeep: Some story progression I guess, but the more he tried to move forward the more people offerred side quests for him
[2017-03-01 19:02:47 UTC] shotinthedeep: So much dialogue
[2017-03-01 19:03:12 UTC] yacherdy: Well, the thing is...for a game like this, the more side quests the merrier. If it's trying to be like a open world RPG it should have tons of side quests.
[2017-03-01 19:03:20 UTC] yacherdy: Think Skyrim.
[2017-03-01 19:03:21 UTC] shotinthedeep: Yeah I agree yacherdy
[2017-03-01 19:03:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yup those first 4 hours weren't the most entralling
[2017-03-01 19:03:44 UTC] yacherdy: Of course, whether those side quests are entertaining or not, is up to you.
[2017-03-01 19:03:47 UTC] shotinthedeep: There's been some unique side quests like starting with the guy defending the gate
[2017-03-01 19:03:57 UTC] lvlpower: hello everyone I'm going to be here half an hour
[2017-03-01 19:03:58 UTC] darksydephil: oh wtf

[2017-03-01 19:15:49 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: DarksydePhil, I'm just curious why you set it up like that, it seems to be this way a lot of the time. The prestream runs like 30+ mins ahead of the scheduled time
[2017-03-01 19:15:55 UTC] burnout26: there we go I had to refresh the stream it wasnt live for me.
[2017-03-01 19:16:04 UTC] jmon_1985: Jimbob whats going on
[2017-03-01 19:16:05 UTC] deltaforce355: hey darksydephil . are you enjoying the game?
[2017-03-01 19:16:05 UTC] betheboom: booo vince
[2017-03-01 19:16:06 UTC] capstonegaming: technical difficulties
[2017-03-01 19:16:07 UTC] akioartorius: so Trials today huh... Bets on how many times Phil will attempt it?
[2017-03-01 19:16:19 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: the birds are chirpin that DSP is live
[2017-03-01 19:16:26 UTC] capstonegaming: the tweeters
[2017-03-01 19:16:34 UTC] aglet57: @darkandfullofterrors That's how the schedule has always been
[2017-03-01 19:16:37 UTC] shotinthedeep: Good to hear. Last night's stream was very chill
[2017-03-01 19:16:49 UTC] betheboom: i just got to where phil ending first stream yesterday :D and i didnt watch second stream videos so imma be so lost but i dont care
[2017-03-01 19:16:50 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: AGLET57, yeah, and I'm asking why it works that way. It makes no sense
[2017-03-01 19:16:51 UTC] lvlpower: supposedly it should have been release of the same day when it's supposed to leave to come out intendo switch
[2017-03-01 19:17:06 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah, last nights stream was fun.
[2017-03-01 19:17:07 UTC] darksydephil: thats how i stream. gives time to work out bugs and build up the stream before i start. and i always give the amount of gameplay i promise (used to be 3, now 4 hours). there's nothig to complain about, you're just impatient
[2017-03-01 19:17:11 UTC] darksydephil: so please stop whining
[2017-03-01 19:17:13 UTC] aglet57: @darkandfullofterrors That I cannot explain. Not my channel.
[2017-03-01 19:17:19 UTC] shotinthedeep: There was hack game design bethe
[2017-03-01 19:17:25 UTC] shotinthedeep: in Phil's favor
[2017-03-01 19:17:28 UTC] yacherdy: deep Kappa
[2017-03-01 19:17:29 UTC] freshjiivetv: who is whining
[2017-03-01 19:17:34 UTC] leonaras: Hey phil, gonna keep blaming the game for your poor stream turnouts rather than blaming the quality of your content? Kappa
[2017-03-01 19:17:38 UTC] jmon_1985: Idk
[2017-03-01 19:17:42 UTC] lagfairy0: what bugs
[2017-03-01 19:17:57 UTC] capstonegaming: Leonaras isnt he a regular?
[2017-03-01 19:17:59 UTC] darksydephil: people have been playing this game since early monday. im not going to be super surprised that attendance isn't great, sorry
[2017-03-01 19:18:01 UTC] capstonegaming: saw him hear yesterday
[2017-03-01 19:18:02 UTC] freshjiivetv: anyone watch the Shadow of War trailer? looks awesome.
[2017-03-01 19:18:18 UTC] darksydephil: ok gonns piss, then prestream time
[2017-03-01 19:18:21 UTC] aglet57: I actually leave the stream cause I don't want spoilers. Really want to play this one
[2017-03-01 19:18:21 UTC] mikebpfallon: problem is Phil just sees the hateful comments so ignores everyone else. so genuine viewers miss out
[2017-03-01 19:18:24 UTC] theycallmejimbob: neon wont be here for a while, Barca is playing Sporting Gijon now
[2017-03-01 19:18:27 UTC] akioartorius: bathroom break
[2017-03-01 19:18:27 UTC] capstonegaming: yeah and tbh this game is boring as hell to watch but it looks like a GREAT game
[2017-03-01 19:18:33 UTC] capstonegaming: idk how they pulled that off
[2017-03-01 19:18:42 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I like the Iron Giant fan art :D

[2017-03-01 21:25:48 UTC] hapticbabyman: anyway, DSP that's kind of the point w/ games that focus on animals and the environment and stuff like that; same thing like in Avatar

[2017-03-01 21:26:57 UTC] diobrand00: its hard to enjoy a repetitive grindfest of a game like this
[2017-03-01 21:27:00 UTC] hapticbabyman: @anondublo1 yep, that's obvious tbh
[2017-03-01 21:27:03 UTC] shotinthedeep: That's pretty good crazed
[2017-03-01 21:27:09 UTC] diobrand00: the mainstream media was smoking dick if they rated this game high

[2017-03-01 21:27:17 UTC] ands_: So diobrand is basically trolling. Good to know.

[2017-03-01 21:27:27 UTC] crazed_connovore: what was the production budget for this game dspHmm
[2017-03-01 21:27:31 UTC] focusdakid: that honestly did not look that difficult...
[2017-03-01 21:27:33 UTC] diobrand00: Ands my opinion is trolling???

[2017-03-01 21:27:34 UTC] anondublo1: I agree though @diobrand00 this game is very uninspired
[2017-03-01 21:27:36 UTC] vendatus: seemed easy MingLee
[2017-03-01 21:27:37 UTC] mosesatemyburrito: @diobrand00 it's like people have differing opinions
[2017-03-01 21:27:38 UTC] diobrand00: good to know you are a blatant idiot

[2017-03-01 21:27:42 UTC] hapticbabyman: like c'mon DSP, you have to kill it b/c that shows the hypocrisy of the game's world
[2017-03-01 21:27:58 UTC] ands_: @diobrand00 When you make comments like some of the ones you've made - yea. You're trolling.
[2017-03-01 21:28:09 UTC] hapticbabyman: @diobrand00 keep crankin' that edgelord factor to 11
[2017-03-01 21:28:11 UTC] diobrand00: What are you babbling about? Please explain

[2017-03-01 21:28:34 UTC] codenameone: This game's not smart enough for political commentary. Keep that shit in Killzone, devs.
[2017-03-01 21:28:36 UTC] anondublo1: stop disliking what I like, bascially
[2017-03-01 21:28:44 UTC] eternia_forever: 28 billion turkish leara @Crazed_Connovore
[2017-03-01 21:28:55 UTC] ands_: @diobrand00 If that is incoherent, then you're grasp of basic words isn't too great. Try another insult that doesn't insult yourself as well.
[2017-03-01 21:28:55 UTC] thenovu: Man killzone is rad
[2017-03-01 21:28:57 UTC] crazed_connovore: virtual protesters??? haha

[2017-03-01 21:29:46 UTC] eternia_forever: hey doc you sleeping @DoctorZzZ
[2017-03-01 21:29:51 UTC] codenameone: It's a game about humanity's fall to robots and they're jacking off to their pseudo-intellectual political commentary.
[2017-03-01 21:29:53 UTC] stray_meow: i want to give dsp a square block and a round hole and just watch his mind break...
[2017-03-01 21:29:56 UTC] ands_: Ha. Fanboys. . .welp good to know I can dismiss this nonsense out of hand.
[2017-03-01 21:30:03 UTC] hapticbabyman: @diobrand00 who are the fanboys? where are they?
[2017-03-01 21:30:11 UTC] anondublo1: every conversation is cringeworthy MingLee

[2017-03-01 21:30:27 UTC] ands_: @anondublo1 Yea some of the non-major NPC commentary isn't that great.
[2017-03-01 21:30:28 UTC] eternia_forever: figure us out
[2017-03-01 21:30:39 UTC] diobrand00: Any game that has some pseudo philosophical reasoning no matter how absurd will be loved by retards hence why MGS was popular
[2017-03-01 21:30:44 UTC] bobbi_ling: whole game is cringe
[2017-03-01 21:30:47 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Roach

[2017-03-01 21:31:23 UTC] myteewun: DSP The King of Babies
[2017-03-01 21:31:31 UTC] codenameone: At least in MGS the political commentary was relevant. This is like injecting the 2016 Presidential election into Blade Runner.
[2017-03-01 21:31:31 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: lol
[2017-03-01 21:31:41 UTC] dukaduka: nah the game is fine, if just a modern looking middle of the rode game

[2017-03-01 21:32:24 UTC] diobrand00: 30k idiots
[2017-03-01 21:32:25 UTC] eternia_forever: had rid of that damm headdress
[2017-03-01 21:32:26 UTC] bobbi_ling: whole game has an odd aura
[2017-03-01 21:32:26 UTC] mosesatemyburrito: @diobrand00 also the gameplay of the MGS series might have something to do with why people like them so much
[2017-03-01 21:32:27 UTC] anondublo1: remember then bioshock infinite was the citizen kane of video games? Kappa
[2017-03-01 21:32:29 UTC] taniaraven: Phil if you want to grow your sub/follow/view levels, stop bashing a game you make mistake on. also start banning trolls ty
[2017-03-01 21:32:37 UTC] codenameone: @Ands I was referring to the article Phil read in-game about the free speech crackdown. In a game about robots taking over humanity.
[2017-03-01 21:32:43 UTC] codenameone: It's out of place.
[2017-03-01 21:32:47 UTC] thenovu: I'd pay to see that like, honestly
[2017-03-01 21:32:47 UTC] ewynsoch: do u guys think aloy is still pure
[2017-03-01 21:32:55 UTC] royal_phalanx91: what?
[2017-03-01 21:32:57 UTC] dukaduka: @Bobbi_Ling, i believe that aura could be called "stale"
[2017-03-01 21:32:59 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: u never know
[2017-03-01 21:33:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: uhhhhhhhhhh
[2017-03-01 21:33:01 UTC] ands_: @CodenameOne It's not out of place. Play the game or wait for him to actually piece it all together.
[2017-03-01 21:33:07 UTC] anondublo1: @TaniaRaven he bans everyone, including regulars, that's actually why a lot of people dislike him Kappa
[2017-03-01 21:33:10 UTC] tehbreezy1: Phil, you were complaining about story progression earlier. Why are you only working on errands instead of main quests?
[2017-03-01 21:33:32 UTC] diobrand00: cant believe he skipped tales of berseria for this shit game
[2017-03-01 21:33:40 UTC] hapticbabyman: @TehBreezy1 Good point. Didn't he say he was going to focus on main quests this stream?
[2017-03-01 21:33:46 UTC] darksydephil: because i need to play this to review the game?
[2017-03-01 21:33:46 UTC] taniaraven: if you're a regular troll, i'd ban too
[2017-03-01 21:33:46 UTC] darksydephil: lol
[2017-03-01 21:33:50 UTC] stray_meow: i feel bad for the person who has to make that climb to work everyday
[2017-03-01 21:33:55 UTC] subzero2891: atpRtsd
[2017-03-01 21:34:05 UTC] codenameone: @Ands I'm supposed to believe a commentary about free speech is relevant to a game's story of man's hubris leading to a machine revolution?
[2017-03-01 21:34:08 UTC] dukaduka: OpeiOP
[2017-03-01 21:34:11 UTC] anondublo1: Keepo
[2017-03-01 21:34:11 UTC] dukaduka: OpieOP
[2017-03-01 21:34:57 UTC] capstonegaming: ?
[2017-03-01 21:35:08 UTC] hapticbabyman: @CodenameOne People who may've had solutions to prevent the revolution before it happened may've had their opinions silenced b/c of lack of free speech. So that's one take on it.
[2017-03-01 21:35:21 UTC] capstonegaming: that was a legit question
[2017-03-01 21:35:27 UTC] capstonegaming: just finish MQ and be done with it
[2017-03-01 21:35:30 UTC] capstonegaming: its a time sink
[2017-03-01 21:35:39 UTC] diobrand00: Capstone the whole game is a time sink
[2017-03-01 21:35:39 UTC] dukaduka: i'm just going to chalk up all these missions to building a reputation among the people and the main mission is to find clues to find mom
[2017-03-01 21:35:40 UTC] diobrand00: \it sucks
[2017-03-01 21:35:48 UTC] ands_: @CodenameOne the company mention in that text is clearly a part of why the world is in the state it is in. So yes, it's relevant.
[2017-03-01 21:36:14 UTC] dukaduka: every video game is a time sink lol
[2017-03-01 21:36:14 UTC] diobrand00: Breaktime
[2017-03-01 21:36:21 UTC] anondublo1: the map seriously looks like far cry primal

[2017-03-01 21:36:41 UTC] diobrand00: This game basically is an upgraded version of far cry primal
[2017-03-01 21:36:43 UTC] crazed_connovore: haha
[2017-03-01 21:36:50 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: oh the cameras been on the whole time huh?
[2017-03-01 21:36:51 UTC] codenameone: @Ands @hapticbabyman I guess. It still seems off-putting.
[2017-03-01 21:36:52 UTC] bobbi_ling: camera jokes will never end
[2017-03-01 21:36:52 UTC] iconicmaster1: Nice calming music playing Kreygasm

[2017-03-01 21:37:04 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: Am I banned?

[2017-03-01 21:37:26 UTC] bobbi_ling: beth is fapping

[2017-03-01 21:37:35 UTC] diobrand00: Or a shittier version of shadows of mordor
[2017-03-01 21:37:41 UTC] camstaaz: The only people saying this is the same game as Far Cry are the people that haven't played it

[2017-03-01 21:38:05 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: @anondublo1 I just couldn't see my message.
[2017-03-01 21:38:08 UTC] ambervisage: its not the same game, but it definitely got some kind of inspiration from the newer far cry games
[2017-03-01 21:38:09 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: Hence why I asked
[2017-03-01 21:38:13 UTC] shotinthedeep: Oh ok...yeah probably after becky said brb hearing what bethe said to dragin
[2017-03-01 21:38:28 UTC] bobbi_ling: beth is lurking with a smile on his face TheRinger

[2017-03-01 21:38:53 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: So while Phil goes to relieve stress, let's chat.
[2017-03-01 21:38:56 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: How's the weather?
[2017-03-01 21:39:01 UTC] royal_phalanx91: shit lol
[2017-03-01 21:39:01 UTC] thenovu: Game seems fine, but ordinary, wouldn't buy for 60 dollars what with Nier coming out
[2017-03-01 21:39:04 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: Cause it's fucking cold here.
[2017-03-01 21:39:12 UTC] ambervisage: depends on what u consider "shit"
[2017-03-01 21:39:15 UTC] theycallmejimbob: we have a yellow wind warning here
[2017-03-01 21:39:16 UTC] crazed_connovore: about to storm @the_inkvader_squid_girl

[2017-03-01 21:39:20 UTC] mosesatemyburrito: @thenovu yeah probably worth getting on a sale
[2017-03-01 21:39:21 UTC] diobrand00: I dont blame phill for skipping Nier he would have no clue wtf was going on
[2017-03-01 21:39:23 UTC] royal_phalanx91: rainy and windy
[2017-03-01 21:39:24 UTC] ambervisage: it was raining super hard here and its kinda cold, but i love it.
[2017-03-01 21:39:25 UTC] anondublo1: it looks like far cry primal, with tomb raider leveling/combat/interfaces, skyrim art direction, with the mass effect dialogue wheel Kappa
[2017-03-01 21:39:32 UTC] anondublo1: with robots thrown in just for good measure
[2017-03-01 21:39:32 UTC] thenovu: Nier would eat Phil alive lmao
[2017-03-01 21:39:33 UTC] bootdrive: yeah
[2017-03-01 21:39:37 UTC] thenovu: ITS SO COOL THOUGH JESUS
[2017-03-01 21:39:41 UTC] bootdrive: I noticed the tomb raider vibe in this game
[2017-03-01 21:39:43 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: @Crazed_Connovore Just got through a bad storm myself. Honestly thought I might die last nihgt.
[2017-03-01 21:39:46 UTC] thenovu: Literally a dream game for me
[2017-03-01 21:39:46 UTC] capstonegaming: the graphics
[2017-03-01 21:39:52 UTC] capstonegaming: thats what the gimmick is?
[2017-03-01 21:40:02 UTC] mosesatemyburrito: @thenovu the enemy and world designs seem really cool
[2017-03-01 21:40:02 UTC] crazed_connovore: the wind here is nuts
[2017-03-01 21:40:07 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: Same here
[2017-03-01 21:40:08 UTC] shotinthedeep: Moses you missed bethe and his wife here earlier in the stream
[2017-03-01 21:40:12 UTC] diobrand00: The giant robots are the gimmick here from whati can see
[2017-03-01 21:40:26 UTC] mosesatemyburrito: @shootinthedeep well that's lucky for me
[2017-03-01 21:40:29 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: Blowing Harder Winds here than Phil's Pre Streams where I am right now.

[2017-03-01 21:40:51 UTC] stray_meow: @diobrand00 the fact that he skipped and subjectivly better game is asinine
[2017-03-01 21:41:15 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: I want Phil to play Paper Mario N64. Just to see how it goes.
[2017-03-01 21:41:25 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: But I'm starting to think I'm the only one who wants it.
[2017-03-01 21:41:29 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: Oh well.
[2017-03-01 21:41:34 UTC] dukaduka: trailers are hype builders. Just look at Nier Automata; it's nothing like what the trailers advertise
[2017-03-01 21:41:35 UTC] anondublo1: @shotinthedeep "wife"
[2017-03-01 21:41:38 UTC] anondublo1: Kappa
[2017-03-01 21:41:49 UTC] diobrand00: I mean he was under the impression this would get more views so for a business decision it makes sense but it looks like it backfired
[2017-03-01 21:41:51 UTC] availableusername888: im waiting for him to play danganronpa.. its perfect for phil
[2017-03-01 21:42:04 UTC] bobbi_ling: phil + shenmue would be the best
[2017-03-01 21:42:11 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: Meh. Next time he has downtime I'll bring the idea up to him.
[2017-03-01 21:42:25 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: He should play Manhunt
[2017-03-01 21:42:25 UTC] skysands2017: @dukaduka why? I was planning to get Nier. Turns out to be a bad game?
[2017-03-01 21:42:27 UTC] eternia_forever: alright alright alright
[2017-03-01 21:42:29 UTC] ambervisage: its kinda sad he never finished scarface
[2017-03-01 21:42:32 UTC] anondublo1: that would probably get a lot of views
[2017-03-01 21:42:34 UTC] ambervisage: its not like he was stuck or anything
[2017-03-01 21:42:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he should do another pogo boomer run in Choice Chamber
[2017-03-01 21:42:44 UTC] ginosaji48: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpS3hoaHkC8

[2017-03-01 21:43:28 UTC] taniaraven: this game isnt bad, he just makes bad choice. like using a sniping bow on a boss fight.

[2017-03-01 22:53:44 UTC] tenpiece32: well since Phil doesn't joke around with games anymore he could play a moba
[2017-03-01 22:53:51 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: I've been ignoring video game reviews and just played retro video jaymes for the last year. Has anything improved in the industry since?
[2017-03-01 22:53:59 UTC] anondublo1: @Crazed_Connovore he really doesn't even get paid on views anymore, but if he can get more people on stream, that's more potentially bits/subs
[2017-03-01 22:54:16 UTC] shotinthedeep: :( I'm sad no more temple no more ship no more statue

[2017-03-01 22:54:35 UTC] hapticbabyman: mobas have too much of a learning curve; he's have to get at least somewhat proficient off-screen b/c no one wants to watch him spend 3+ hours learning the basics on-stream
[2017-03-01 22:54:48 UTC] bobbi_ling: no a masterpiece best seller
[2017-03-01 22:54:49 UTC] encelor: moba's are easy to play imo

[2017-03-01 22:55:11 UTC] tenpiece32: If DSP ever hated on a popular moba the nerd community would give no quarter
[2017-03-01 22:55:21 UTC] deltaforce355: phil playing bad games = more views
[2017-03-01 22:55:22 UTC] betheboom: bobbi is definitely a troll after that no mans sky comment

[2017-03-01 22:55:53 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: Do video game reviewers still accept bribes like whores?

[2017-03-01 23:34:39 UTC] ganjasniper420_swegolas: @amplitory2 no, but women are inferior to men in competitive gaming, as a fact. if not we would simply have good female gamers. all we have is tis on twitch
[2017-03-01 23:34:40 UTC] jmon_1985: *mgs

[2017-03-01 23:35:26 UTC] capstonegaming: DEHHH he go fucked up
[2017-03-01 23:35:43 UTC] hapticbabyman: @ganjasniper420_swegolas well it's like I said before; there's no genetic factor behind that. It's just that there are less women who play those kind of games than guys, so there's always the greater chance the better skilled players will be guys simply b/c there's more of them who play those games
[2017-03-01 23:35:44 UTC] amplitory2: Yeah, I mean who doesn't.. like tits. I don't personally sub to a girl for tits tho. I go to porn if I wanna see that

[2017-03-01 23:36:41 UTC] amplitory2: @ganjasniper420_swegolas same here. They missed my point and said I was just the reason and the problem of why women aren't competitive in games
[2017-03-01 23:36:44 UTC] pimplefacedpantysniffer: the "Biased media" is saying nothing is happening. Independent journalist are finding out the truth about Sweden.
[2017-03-01 23:36:52 UTC] anondublo1: it's not phil's stream chat until shit starts getting weird

[2017-03-01 23:37:30 UTC] ganjasniper420_swegolas: @hapticbabyman you do not know if there is. your assumption is based on women and men being equal in potential, you do not know that. what if women are in fact better but play less? thus the chance wont be higher. however, everywhere in the world where theres money, theres professional athletes of both genders, but not really in gaming
[2017-03-01 23:37:36 UTC] tenpiece32: Ok fuck thiks
[2017-03-01 23:37:37 UTC] amplitory2: To be completely honest I'm surprised to find a feminist SJW on Phil's stream. Guess you can never get away from em can ya?

[2017-03-01 23:37:59 UTC] ganjasniper420_swegolas: @hapticbabyman just as it is in most high-earning and difficult jobs simply becuase women are of nature less skilled at such than men

[2017-03-01 23:39:18 UTC] hapticbabyman: @ganjasniper420_swegolas I don't know where you got that idea from but it's not exactly legit. There's nothing indicating a woman can't be as skilled as a male in a competitive game, she'd just have to be the right kind of woman. Just like how not all guys are great at competitive games (or even good at them)
[2017-03-01 23:39:20 UTC] ganjasniper420_swegolas: @amplitory2 for real man, but im not a retard (no offense) nor a woman so i got a high earning job anyway

[2017-03-01 23:40:58 UTC] hapticbabyman: but if someone wanted to say that, currently, there aren't that many (if any) females in competitive games that are as good as the current male counterparts (say, at fighting games), they'd be correct for the most part. That could of course change some day
