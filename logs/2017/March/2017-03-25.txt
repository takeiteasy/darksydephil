[2017-03-25 18:12:20 UTC] blue_blur64: And the PS theme has the night music, which is just lovely <3
[2017-03-25 18:12:22 UTC] wolfofthedawn: doing good, just getting myself settled in for another mass effect stream
[2017-03-25 18:12:27 UTC] saielponpon: It's never coming out
[2017-03-25 18:13:01 UTC] darksydephil: i love youtube statistics because they dont make any sense
[2017-03-25 18:13:19 UTC] darksydephil: im apparently losing subs, yet views and profit are up. yes google, your statistics are very meaningful

[2017-03-25 18:14:40 UTC] wolfofthedawn: it makes perfect sense phil, you just ain't hipster enough to understand Kappa
[2017-03-25 18:14:53 UTC] blue_blur64: You might want to expect ad revenue to go down in the future because of big advertisers leaving youtube
[2017-03-25 18:14:55 UTC] capstonegaming: machinima sold their company so....they arent "real" anymore
[2017-03-25 18:15:13 UTC] darksydephil: blue_blur64 that already happened, and ad revenue is still up
[2017-03-25 18:15:18 UTC] darksydephil: i wasn't getting the better ads before anyway
[2017-03-25 18:15:24 UTC] saielponpon: Not like they put out good content anyways
[2017-03-25 18:15:26 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh ok
[2017-03-25 18:15:27 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: But is the increased ad revenue worth not being managed
[2017-03-25 18:15:47 UTC] darksydephil: KingOfHypocrisy from all i can see, im making more now than when i was managed

[2017-03-25 18:19:24 UTC] darksydephil: top cheer has been reset
[2017-03-25 18:19:34 UTC] wolfofthedawn: hmmmm
[2017-03-25 18:19:35 UTC] conky89: I have been seeing footage of this game. It looks like a game that could have been done in the last console generation.
[2017-03-25 18:19:44 UTC] blue_blur64: Although you can actually see who is in the radius now :D
[2017-03-25 18:19:47 UTC] young_wobblez: yo

[2017-03-25 18:21:26 UTC] o0kingsix0o: @saielponpon, Based on how the game is designed thus far, I don't actually think it'll have a real ending. I bet you'll be able to play the game after the ending.
[2017-03-25 18:21:28 UTC] djruno1: hello
[2017-03-25 18:21:28 UTC] saielponpon: Popular Opinion: 3 ruined the Mass Effect series

[2017-03-25 18:22:18 UTC] o0kingsix0o: @saielponpon, I disagree. ME3 was an amazing game, with the exception of the last hour or so.
[2017-03-25 18:22:21 UTC] conky89: I think there was too much hype for ME3.
[2017-03-25 18:22:45 UTC] miss_kelcher: snow planet is best planet :P

[2017-03-25 18:23:04 UTC] conky89: ME3 as a whole felt underwhelming and somewhat rushed to me
[2017-03-25 18:23:06 UTC] slurmdrinker: Man Zelda is long
[2017-03-25 18:23:18 UTC] saielponpon: A.K.A "The Old Connecticut Planet"
[2017-03-25 18:23:29 UTC] blue_blur64: Well what's intersting about the faces is that it might not be the animators' fault
[2017-03-25 18:23:37 UTC] blue_blur64: *interesting
[2017-03-25 18:23:39 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: hey there jimbob

[2017-03-25 18:24:15 UTC] blue_blur64: It might be because of the game designers
[2017-03-25 18:24:23 UTC] o0kingsix0o: @Conky89, True...but when the faces in ME:A are worse than ME1, you know you've fucked up.
[2017-03-25 18:24:30 UTC] conky89: I was freaking out before you arrived
[2017-03-25 18:24:30 UTC] betheboom: hey delta

[2017-03-25 18:25:10 UTC] conky89: The reason why many characters have a collar around there head with close up views is to reduce the amount of animation

[2017-03-25 18:56:17 UTC] conky89: Then again Bioware took inspiration for their races from many sci-fi stories

[2017-03-25 19:04:48 UTC] royal_phalanx91: LOL the dialogue is bugged
[2017-03-25 19:04:50 UTC] wolfofthedawn: well CodenameOne this what happens when dev teams are forming factions during the development of a game and not communicating with each other
[2017-03-25 19:04:54 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Look at those rock formations. NotATK
[2017-03-25 19:05:06 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Bioware Montreal had a 'bro culture'
[2017-03-25 19:05:13 UTC] vendatus: I fell through the world last night fighting an architect on Eos VoHiYo
[2017-03-25 19:05:16 UTC] royal_phalanx91: according to disgruntled employee on glassdoor
[2017-03-25 19:05:29 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Also management fuckery, team members leaving, etc.
[2017-03-25 19:05:42 UTC] conky89: Bioware is a mess these days. So many important people have left it...
[2017-03-25 19:05:48 UTC] royal_phalanx91: This game's dev cycle was a fucking nightmare
[2017-03-25 19:05:53 UTC] bentboxer: you were hypnotized by your girlfriends mother @Vendatus

[2017-03-25 19:06:07 UTC] royal_phalanx91: It's realistic
[2017-03-25 19:06:18 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Your car can't drive up that hill quickly :P
[2017-03-25 19:06:25 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I would watch Phil doing a playthrough of Simpsons: Hit & Run, then BioWare's glitch-fest of a game. :D
[2017-03-25 19:06:25 UTC] xgameofpwns: bugged bioware mechanics
[2017-03-25 19:06:34 UTC] o0kingsix0o: Games aren't really about realism, though.
[2017-03-25 19:06:37 UTC] stuart360: Phil really doesn't remember the driving in the first game
[2017-03-25 19:06:41 UTC] wolfofthedawn: yeah but ubisoft has been a mess for how many years now?
[2017-03-25 19:06:44 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Jaal is the only memorable character in this game
[2017-03-25 19:06:45 UTC] vendatus: WutFace that makes zero sense Bentboxer Kappa
[2017-03-25 19:06:46 UTC] codenameone: @0megaj0ker Man you really want Phil to play that.
[2017-03-25 19:06:48 UTC] errnoent: Phil usually when this happens in a game it means you're not taking a recommended route
[2017-03-25 19:07:01 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @CodenameOne yes I do Kappa

[2017-03-25 19:07:37 UTC] xgameofpwns: I want to see Phil do more playthroughs of mid=2000's games like jak 2
[2017-03-25 19:07:45 UTC] codenameone: @errnoent Good choice.
[2017-03-25 19:07:57 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: hobos or dogs

[2017-03-25 19:08:34 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @errnoent You're choice man. Know plenty of adults who will always like Nintendo games. but if that's not your style then np.
[2017-03-25 19:08:37 UTC] codenameone: If I had to pick one game that I really want Phil to play it'd be Valkyria Chronices.
[2017-03-25 19:08:46 UTC] 0megaj0ker: too many kett's, needs more Raiders Kappa
[2017-03-25 19:08:54 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I still want Phil to play XCOM 2
[2017-03-25 19:09:07 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He'd get destroyed but it would be funny as hell
[2017-03-25 19:09:24 UTC] wolfofthedawn: I want phil to play ride to hell retribution Kappa
[2017-03-25 19:09:27 UTC] conky89: I just hope the Switch actually has a good library. The WiiU had some good games but a small library overall
[2017-03-25 19:09:33 UTC] errnoent: @neobornbloodmoonspartan9 Yeah I really like games like mario party and mario kart but really what makes those fun to me is the people you play them with. These days I'm more of a solo gamer, sometimes online. The new mario odyssey game would be pretty cool but it's not worth buying the switch just for that IMO
[2017-03-25 19:09:47 UTC] blue_blur64: God damn my team spawn camped the other side hard LUL

[2017-03-25 19:10:21 UTC] vendatus: NA aim MingLee
[2017-03-25 19:11:13 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @errnoent I wish I could see another Metroid, Starfox like Starfox assault, or a Battalion Wars 3 game. I miss Battalion Wars, kinda meh story, but fun action, so underrated.
[2017-03-25 19:11:22 UTC] bentboxer: this planet is miserable like canadian weather in the winter
[2017-03-25 19:11:33 UTC] errnoent: Yeah, a new metroid would be awesome
[2017-03-25 19:11:58 UTC] conky89: It's up in the Air is Nintendo will continue with Metroid right now
[2017-03-25 19:12:16 UTC] conky89: The most recent game did poorly. And then there is Other M...
[2017-03-25 19:12:32 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Other M was fine imo.

[2017-03-25 21:04:35 UTC] ares6craft: @availableusername888 it was obvious the director of LIFE knew they just wanted to make an action suspense movie. So the script was pretty minimal and they even forego the usual 15 minute of introduction. Straight into the meat the movie

[2017-03-25 21:18:37 UTC] duderito2: I'm allowed an opinion, block someone if you're gonna block someone or better yet don't reply to him. It comes across as extremely petty and cringey to announce it to the chat you're going to.
[2017-03-25 21:18:39 UTC] conky89: Same never had Papa Johns either

[2017-03-25 22:42:28 UTC] wolflinksaji: @betheboom If it has EA slapped onto it, it makes it AAA.
