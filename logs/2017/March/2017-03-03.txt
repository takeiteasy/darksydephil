[2017-03-03 19:10:54 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: is anyone else starting to get worried?
[2017-03-03 19:10:54 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Problem is machinima is the biggest company that gives the best deal
[2017-03-03 19:11:00 UTC] podusmonens: jeffaux, Phil said machinima always treated him right
[2017-03-03 19:11:02 UTC] jefffaux1218: It's owned by a 15 year old. I'm not joking.
[2017-03-03 19:11:12 UTC] freewayrickross: link?
[2017-03-03 19:11:13 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: so if you want to maximize the profit you pretty much have to go with machinima
[2017-03-03 19:11:14 UTC] jefffaux1218: After that its a series of interns who are basically adopting and partnering people they like.
[2017-03-03 19:11:16 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: like these might be the last days of phil on youtube
[2017-03-03 19:11:22 UTC] aglet57: Yeah, they were with him until they weren't with him. Garbage
[2017-03-03 19:11:32 UTC] jefffaux1218: The youtubers "Bro Team Pill" actively tried to get away from Machinima.
[2017-03-03 19:11:34 UTC] burnout26: Alot of the peope I am subbed to on YT uses Fullscreen
[2017-03-03 19:11:39 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: he said himself he might be gone by summer
[2017-03-03 19:11:45 UTC] jefffaux1218: Bro Team had to basically burn the building down to the ground to get away from Machinima.
[2017-03-03 19:12:02 UTC] jefffaux1218: Machinima will and have fucked their partners as hard as they can to anyone they've had in their partnership.
[2017-03-03 19:12:12 UTC] freewayrickross: I need some Phil in my life, hope he can navigate this storm
[2017-03-03 19:12:17 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Besides copyright protection, what other advantages are there to be in an organization?
[2017-03-03 19:12:18 UTC] renastella: ya fullscreen is pretty awesome compared to machinima
[2017-03-03 19:12:27 UTC] jmon_1985: where are you guys getting this news
[2017-03-03 19:12:34 UTC] jefffaux1218: Machinima has changed hands something like 3 (or more) times since it originally started.
[2017-03-03 19:12:45 UTC] aglet57: Phil said on Twitter that he was leaving Machinima
[2017-03-03 19:12:45 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: well atleast will get to see him play mass effect
[2017-03-03 19:12:47 UTC] jefffaux1218: I believe its something like a 35+ mill anually a company
[2017-03-03 19:12:54 UTC] aglet57: There's a thread on the bored but I didn't read it
[2017-03-03 19:13:13 UTC] goldencolts: machininma used to have this awesome website that had actually michinima (cinematic movies made with games) on it
[2017-03-03 19:13:20 UTC] jefffaux1218: Regardless of anyones standing, the best standing to have with Machinima is to get the fuck away from them.
[2017-03-03 19:13:21 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: @jefffaux1218 thats actually pretty lower then I though it would be
[2017-03-03 19:13:33 UTC] jefffaux1218: It used to be significantly higher.
[2017-03-03 19:13:38 UTC] betheboom: just watch he will be here in a few months and everything will be fine
[2017-03-03 19:13:39 UTC] goldencolts: there was alot of cool stuff made with cs 1.6
[2017-03-03 19:13:42 UTC] podusmonens: whya re you guys hating on machinima so hard?
[2017-03-03 19:13:50 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: i hope so bethe
[2017-03-03 19:14:00 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: DSP and Machinima are no longer partnered
[2017-03-03 19:14:04 UTC] goldencolts: thats mostly gone now
[2017-03-03 19:14:08 UTC] jefffaux1218: Machinima as a company is trash. The people involved in it are generally fine.
[2017-03-03 19:14:09 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: but things are looking pretty grim right now
[2017-03-03 19:14:10 UTC] theycallmejimbob: wow what a month first his dryer went, then the YT fiasco, then the faucet and now this. Phil must of walked under 20 ladders
[2017-03-03 19:14:27 UTC] jefffaux1218: Leafy was a part of Machinima and regardless of your standing emotionally with him, he was very happy to have his contract ended with them.
[2017-03-03 19:14:37 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Well shit comes all at once, it rarely is ever staggered when you are most ready for it
[2017-03-03 19:14:37 UTC] freewayrickross: No kidding, when it rain's it pours
[2017-03-03 19:14:48 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Finally finished it
[2017-03-03 19:15:05 UTC] sonsofkojima1: hi
[2017-03-03 19:15:08 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Put it on Easy for the last half of Money Island for Mr. Shakedown explolits
[2017-03-03 19:15:09 UTC] podusmonens: yeah, but Leafy is a very controversial character. plus he's not a gamer so what he was doing on machinima anyway?
[2017-03-03 19:15:12 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Hi @sonsofkojima1
[2017-03-03 19:15:14 UTC] aglet57: Oh christ here we go
[2017-03-03 19:15:16 UTC] phoenixrising2015: My OCD was killing me to fishing this
[2017-03-03 19:15:22 UTC] phoenixrising2015: *finish
[2017-03-03 19:15:29 UTC] sonsofkojima1: leafy was on machinima?
[2017-03-03 19:15:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you've finished the game Phoneix?
[2017-03-03 19:15:37 UTC] podusmonens: apparently
[2017-03-03 19:15:40 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Money Island
[2017-03-03 19:15:44 UTC] jefffaux1218: Here's some basic statistics for them: http://www.statsheep.com/machinima
[2017-03-03 19:15:44 UTC] nightbot: jefffaux1218 -> I kill bugs...DEAD! [stop posting links] [warning]
[2017-03-03 19:15:48 UTC] darksydephil: sigh
[2017-03-03 19:15:54 UTC] phoenixrising2015: And have enough points for the unlock to all of Dragon of Dojima
[2017-03-03 19:15:57 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: im sorry phil
[2017-03-03 19:15:58 UTC] aglet57: What up, Phil?
[2017-03-03 19:15:58 UTC] jefffaux1218: Oh shit. cant post a link. . .
[2017-03-03 19:16:05 UTC] darksydephil: so im applying with many different partnership companies, but some of them dont even work
[2017-03-03 19:16:06 UTC] jefffaux1218: Okay there's a link online you can find of their stats.
[2017-03-03 19:16:09 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Next is Club Sunshine and getting Mad Dog
[2017-03-03 19:16:11 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: >( >(
[2017-03-03 19:16:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But I'll wait on that
[2017-03-03 19:16:23 UTC] aglet57: What happened to ScreenWaze or whoever?
[2017-03-03 19:16:31 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: What do you mean "not work"
[2017-03-03 19:16:33 UTC] kg12228: what happened with machinima
[2017-03-03 19:16:39 UTC] capstonegaming: Best of luck to ya phil,
[2017-03-03 19:16:41 UTC] podusmonens: jefaaux who would be a better partner, then?
[2017-03-03 19:16:42 UTC] sonsofkojima1: i think its called screenwave aglet
[2017-03-03 19:16:43 UTC] phoenixrising2015: My autism was literally keeping me from not stopping until Money Island was done
[2017-03-03 19:16:51 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: so being independent is not an option?
[2017-03-03 19:16:52 UTC] burnout26: did u try Fullscreen ?
[2017-03-03 19:16:54 UTC] jefffaux1218: I'm honestly not of any mind to know who's a better partner.
[2017-03-03 19:17:04 UTC] sonsofkojima1: isn't maker studios a partner?
[2017-03-03 19:17:16 UTC] jefffaux1218: I can speak from experience and tell you Rooster Teeth isnt much better.
[2017-03-03 19:17:16 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: A lot of those partner shit companies are sketch as fuck
[2017-03-03 19:17:23 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: ship*
[2017-03-03 19:17:23 UTC] jefffaux1218: Rooster Teeth is a fucking mess from the ground up.
[2017-03-03 19:17:35 UTC] jefffaux1218: But its so successful it doesnt show.
[2017-03-03 19:17:40 UTC] podusmonens: PDP is independent, right?
[2017-03-03 19:17:45 UTC] jefffaux1218: PDP became indie.
[2017-03-03 19:17:54 UTC] sonsofkojima1: PDP was on maker until he was dropped
[2017-03-03 19:17:56 UTC] jefffaux1218: Disney, etc, dropped him because of the "nazi" gate.
[2017-03-03 19:18:02 UTC] skolvikings944: So Im thinkingis everthing ok?
[2017-03-03 19:18:08 UTC] aglet57: No
[2017-03-03 19:18:20 UTC] skolvikings944: :'(
[2017-03-03 19:18:20 UTC] aglet57: Can't get a partner yet or something. He'll address it.
[2017-03-03 19:18:27 UTC] sonsofkojima1: ^
[2017-03-03 19:18:28 UTC] skolvikings944: vlog?
[2017-03-03 19:18:30 UTC] jefffaux1218: There's also exit clauses.
[2017-03-03 19:18:35 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Vidar are you here?
[2017-03-03 19:18:56 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: expecting a predator t oshow up
[2017-03-03 19:18:56 UTC] jefffaux1218: Typically you'll have to have something like a 12 mo time period where you can't legally speak ill or damage or interfere with the financial gainings of a prior company you worked with.
[2017-03-03 19:18:56 UTC] sonsofkojima1: sucks this happened on weekend and not on a monday
[2017-03-03 19:19:04 UTC] podusmonens: well.. screw disney. if the rumor is true that walt disney had nazi ismpaties that's very ironic jeffaux
[2017-03-03 19:19:15 UTC] aglet57: I'm going to unsub from all machinima partner channels I have. This is shit
[2017-03-03 19:19:18 UTC] sonsofkojima1: what PDP did wasn't even bad it just got hyped up
[2017-03-03 19:19:19 UTC] jefffaux1218: I.E. If he was making money for machinima, him partnering with the next company he'd might even have to change his format of lets plays.
[2017-03-03 19:19:22 UTC] theycallmejimbob: probably some non-disclosure agreements etc
[2017-03-03 19:19:23 UTC] kg12228: what happened to machinima
[2017-03-03 19:19:24 UTC] jefffaux1218: There's a lot of weird stipulations.
[2017-03-03 19:19:32 UTC] darksydephil: none of that is in any contract jefffaux1218
[2017-03-03 19:19:41 UTC] darksydephil: that's crazy talk, maybe for big youtubers but certainly not for me lol
[2017-03-03 19:19:51 UTC] hapticbabyman: @podusmonens That Walt stuff isn't exactly true
[2017-03-03 19:19:56 UTC] jefffaux1218: Okay so then you're in the clear.
[2017-03-03 19:19:58 UTC] aglet57: like a disclosing statement @jefffaux1218 ?
[2017-03-03 19:19:59 UTC] sonsofkojima1: I think phil just wants to be signed up and confortable before he tells us what happened
[2017-03-03 19:20:08 UTC] podusmonens: babyman yeah I figured it was sensationalism
[2017-03-03 19:20:12 UTC] aglet57: Oh shit. Is there a non-compete @DarksydePhil ?
[2017-03-03 19:20:18 UTC] aglet57: Like in wrestling companies
[2017-03-03 19:20:24 UTC] darksydephil: nope
[2017-03-03 19:20:26 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: I think it is wise though to at least be somewhat cautious with what you say about it though
[2017-03-03 19:20:27 UTC] aglet57: whew
[2017-03-03 19:20:28 UTC] jefffaux1218: Not like a disclosing statement but like. . . Phil wouldn't be able to do his regular format because thats what people go to see him.
[2017-03-03 19:20:34 UTC] darksydephil: once the contract is over, it's over. and my channels right now are just waiting on teh countdown
[2017-03-03 19:20:41 UTC] jefffaux1218: Like if he does Lets Plays for machinima he'd not be allowed to do them for another company.
[2017-03-03 19:20:48 UTC] aglet57: Christ. How long to you have?
[2017-03-03 19:20:52 UTC] jefffaux1218: But that doesnt seem to be the case.
[2017-03-03 19:20:57 UTC] aglet57: Can we do a petition or something to one of them to help?
[2017-03-03 19:21:00 UTC] hapticbabyman: kinda surreal this just happened out of nowhere. On the day Switch releases, at that.
[2017-03-03 19:21:17 UTC] jefffaux1218: For me what happened was I wasn't allowed to basically do dev stuff and art and whatever for any other company for like X amount of time.
[2017-03-03 19:21:21 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Yeah it was kind of random timing, like all of sudden Machinima is gone.
[2017-03-03 19:21:31 UTC] podusmonens: what happened, babyman?
[2017-03-03 19:21:35 UTC] sonsofkojima1: at least phil will have the switch to cheer him up
[2017-03-03 19:21:49 UTC] aglet57: If you aren't protected, what's going to happen with the Switch??
[2017-03-03 19:21:54 UTC] kg12228: Phil should of had a backup plan tbh
[2017-03-03 19:21:54 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: has it been delivered yet?
[2017-03-03 19:22:23 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: there is no backup plan there never was
[2017-03-03 19:22:31 UTC] mrmarlboroz: so screenwave media? i thought u said crisis averted or wutever?
[2017-03-03 19:22:42 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: so what was the tipping point for this partnership split?
[2017-03-03 19:23:11 UTC] betheboom: you had dspgaming before machinima so now machinima is gone how will that affect dspgaming it will just be like before right
[2017-03-03 19:23:12 UTC] jefffaux1218: You could take a guess by process of deduction from his previous videos.
[2017-03-03 19:23:22 UTC] darksydephil: fullscreen's application page doesn't even work. it just says OOPS something went wrong lol
[2017-03-03 19:23:35 UTC] jefffaux1218: Quality Control not in effect.
[2017-03-03 19:23:39 UTC] podusmonens: wait, is machinima gone or did they just end their partnership with dsp?
[2017-03-03 19:23:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the latter dragin
[2017-03-03 19:23:57 UTC] betheboom: dragin the partnership
[2017-03-03 19:24:09 UTC] podusmonens: well that's too bad
[2017-03-03 19:24:35 UTC] sonsofkojima1: :(
[2017-03-03 19:24:38 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Phil are you using this link? https://fullscreenmedia.co/apply
[2017-03-03 19:24:38 UTC] nightbot: teslawasrobbedac1 -> Yippie ka-yay [stop posting links] [warning]
[2017-03-03 19:24:41 UTC] darksydephil: yeah fullscreen's page doesn't even work, geez
[2017-03-03 19:24:46 UTC] mrmarlboroz: so looks like ur still in the application process is that correct?
[2017-03-03 19:24:49 UTC] welshryosuke: try it on another browser
[2017-03-03 19:24:52 UTC] burnout26: odd it works for me
[2017-03-03 19:24:54 UTC] podusmonens: I can't say I didnt see it coming, tho :(
[2017-03-03 19:25:04 UTC] betheboom: all these applications you are doing phil what if they dont reply instantly what if it takes hours for them to reply
[2017-03-03 19:25:04 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Are you using fullscreenmedia. co
[2017-03-03 19:25:13 UTC] skolvikings944: jeez..
[2017-03-03 19:25:15 UTC] skolvikings944: what a mess
[2017-03-03 19:25:18 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: did phil quit or was he let go
[2017-03-03 19:25:22 UTC] sardarkh: So wait, first they were answering abotu the Youtube ad fiasco, then ended the partnership?
[2017-03-03 19:25:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he can't disclose what happened RickGrimesFan123
[2017-03-03 19:25:31 UTC] kg12228: @rickgrimesfan123 he won't say
[2017-03-03 19:25:42 UTC] gaylordbutthump: let go i assume
[2017-03-03 19:26:01 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: i don't even know other companies like machinima, i though all youtuber were independent
[2017-03-03 19:26:05 UTC] sardarkh: That does leave plenty of room for interpretations for haters.
[2017-03-03 19:26:05 UTC] sonsofkojima1: he's gonna tell us what happened once he's signed with a new company
[2017-03-03 19:26:21 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: its like 2010 all over again
[2017-03-03 19:26:31 UTC] kg12228: @sonsofkojima1 I thought hebhad multiple lined up
[2017-03-03 19:26:36 UTC] kg12228: he had*
[2017-03-03 19:26:39 UTC] skolvikings944: do you NEED a partnership??
[2017-03-03 19:26:52 UTC] jefffaux1218: Partnership is kinda a safety net.
[2017-03-03 19:26:52 UTC] splitplaythru: well yes, otherwise you can't monetize videos
[2017-03-03 19:26:57 UTC] burnout26: I think he needs one to not get content ID claimed
[2017-03-03 19:26:58 UTC] sardarkh: For copyright strikes mostly
[2017-03-03 19:27:14 UTC] kg12228: you can monetize without partnership
[2017-03-03 19:27:14 UTC] skolvikings944: you can monetize without one
[2017-03-03 19:27:14 UTC] hippostabber: you can monetize without a partner
[2017-03-03 19:27:16 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: this is a dangerous time for his channel then
[2017-03-03 19:27:22 UTC] sonsofkojima1: nintendo games and GTA games i think u need a partnership
[2017-03-03 19:27:32 UTC] jefffaux1218: Its less that its dangerous. You're not realizing that you never put all your chips on one horse.
[2017-03-03 19:27:41 UTC] jefffaux1218: Paternship would be just one horse. Patreon is another.
[2017-03-03 19:27:52 UTC] skolvikings944: Phil wont be able to afford his *** medication now :(
[2017-03-03 19:28:20 UTC] podusmonens: his what?
[2017-03-03 19:28:24 UTC] eternia_forever: 33
[2017-03-03 19:28:28 UTC] skolvikings944: ***
[2017-03-03 19:28:30 UTC] skolvikings944: MEDICATION
[2017-03-03 19:28:36 UTC] skolvikings944: AKA THE GIN
[2017-03-03 19:28:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey eternia_forever
[2017-03-03 19:28:48 UTC] darksydephil: let me put it this way. i could easily monetize videos myself without a partnership company, but that would mean im going to get a ton of content ID matches and issues
[2017-03-03 19:28:58 UTC] skolvikings944: exactly
[2017-03-03 19:28:59 UTC] jefffaux1218: shits, dvds, etc. These are all things that cost investment, time, etc. That he'd have to first put in to see payout.
[2017-03-03 19:29:01 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: any update on when the stream is starting?
[2017-03-03 19:29:04 UTC] skolvikings944: exactly what i was saying
[2017-03-03 19:29:04 UTC] eternia_forever: Hey @theycallmejimbob
[2017-03-03 19:29:15 UTC] betheboom: why can't phil just record the videos and not upload them until he is partnered then upload a bunch over a few days
[2017-03-03 19:29:16 UTC] jefffaux1218: *shirts not shit. . . but I mean. . . that'd be a funny product to sell
[2017-03-03 19:29:20 UTC] kg12228: Ok so stream or no
[2017-03-03 19:29:21 UTC] betheboom: wouldn't that be good
[2017-03-03 19:29:27 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: he would be at youtubes mercy
[2017-03-03 19:29:31 UTC] eternia_forever: good afternoon everyone
[2017-03-03 19:29:55 UTC] darksydephil: im honestly not sure what to do right now
[2017-03-03 19:30:06 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: go with your gut phil
[2017-03-03 19:30:07 UTC] jojojingo122: get a job
[2017-03-03 19:30:14 UTC] jezjez321: ^
[2017-03-03 19:30:22 UTC] aglet57: Play some games. You'll feel better.
[2017-03-03 19:30:22 UTC] jmon_1985: wow
[2017-03-03 19:30:30 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: no, working is evil
[2017-03-03 19:30:32 UTC] sardarkh: At this point I'd just get any part time job, focus gameplay exclusively on Twitch, and milk Kogaming for Reviews.
[2017-03-03 19:30:33 UTC] jojojingo122: go with your *** phil
[2017-03-03 19:30:43 UTC] sonsofkojima1: phil just chill until switch comes then stream unboxing
[2017-03-03 19:30:48 UTC] goldencolts: from my point of view the jedi are evil
[2017-03-03 19:30:52 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: Maybe just go 100% into twitch, and say fuck youtube
[2017-03-03 19:30:52 UTC] betheboom: you got a bunch of shirt sales you will get and patreon for now i know it wont help unless you are getting money from youtube but its better than nothing
[2017-03-03 19:31:03 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: only a sith deals in absolutes.
[2017-03-03 19:31:17 UTC] darksydephil: theres no way fulltime streaming on twitch would work that i can see
[2017-03-03 19:31:20 UTC] betheboom: and i still say stream and record but DONT upload until partnered then you will be safe
[2017-03-03 19:31:25 UTC] hapticbabyman: DSP, ease up on the AAA games some. A lot of them aren't as captivating as you think and everyone else already plays them, plus other people are playing them at the same time
[2017-03-03 19:31:32 UTC] skolvikings944: Time to get the classifieds
[2017-03-03 19:31:34 UTC] aglet57: Did the Switch come yet? You could film your unboxing now to take your mind off of this
[2017-03-03 19:31:42 UTC] podusmonens: Phil is there nothing you can do (unintentional) to avoid content ID issues?
[2017-03-03 19:31:43 UTC] hippostabber: fulltime streaming with viewership you get now .no
[2017-03-03 19:31:44 UTC] sonsofkojima1: phil go twitch full time and do jackbox every sunday
[2017-03-03 19:31:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it's not arriving till the evening I think AGLET57
[2017-03-03 19:31:53 UTC] aglet57: ah
[2017-03-03 19:31:59 UTC] hapticbabyman: Twitch would probably work out better than Youtube tbh
[2017-03-03 19:32:02 UTC] darksydephil: i need to not take my mind off of this right now and instead focus and figure out a way to fix it honestly
[2017-03-03 19:32:04 UTC] kg12228: so stream or no
[2017-03-03 19:32:09 UTC] sardarkh: But Dspgaming is a highly potential target for lots of claims withaout a partner. Reviews are safer without sound.
[2017-03-03 19:32:12 UTC] aglet57: Gotcha
[2017-03-03 19:32:23 UTC] aglet57: Can you make up with Machinima?
[2017-03-03 19:32:25 UTC] betheboom: no stream hen?
[2017-03-03 19:32:25 UTC] leo_pirate: pls stream ;__;
[2017-03-03 19:32:26 UTC] eternia_forever: chin up focus on
[2017-03-03 19:32:29 UTC] betheboom: then*
[2017-03-03 19:32:29 UTC] sonsofkojima1: sucks this happened on weekend
[2017-03-03 19:32:30 UTC] leo_pirate: it's okay tho
[2017-03-03 19:32:40 UTC] jojojingo122: go put and get a job in Lynnwood
[2017-03-03 19:32:40 UTC] aglet57: Assuming it was a falling out and not just a business decision I mean
[2017-03-03 19:32:41 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Dude The Legend Style for Kiryu has 999 levels?
[2017-03-03 19:32:45 UTC] sardarkh: At this point Kogaming is the bread winner. Twitch should provide subscriptions and awareness on multiple channels.
[2017-03-03 19:32:45 UTC] masternutella: What happen?
[2017-03-03 19:32:46 UTC] teslawasrobbedac1: So is the stream canceled? :(
[2017-03-03 19:32:47 UTC] phoenixrising2015: What is this Disgaea crap
[2017-03-03 19:32:49 UTC] sonsofkojima1: u could tweet at fullscreen maybe
[2017-03-03 19:32:50 UTC] skolvikings944: http://www(dot)simplyhired(dot)com/search?q=job+fair&l=renton%2C+wa
[2017-03-03 19:32:53 UTC] skolvikings944: There you go phill
[2017-03-03 19:33:00 UTC] jmon_1985: ill be back later
[2017-03-03 19:33:08 UTC] masternutella: What happen with dsp?
[2017-03-03 19:33:16 UTC] iceyfletch: Phil twitch full time has every capability to be perfectly viable, providing you go about it in the right manner.
[2017-03-03 19:33:16 UTC] skolvikings944: He broke up with Machinima
[2017-03-03 19:33:22 UTC] masternutella: Wtf?
[2017-03-03 19:33:27 UTC] masternutella: Why?
[2017-03-03 19:33:28 UTC] iceyfletch: Spending more time on youtube might simply be a bad idea at this point.
[2017-03-03 19:33:34 UTC] hapticbabyman: Focus more on retro games; rage at them, but make sure people know it's just for fun. Big reason lot of people got butthurt about stuff like MGS and Kingdom Hearts is b/c they didn't know all the rage was just for fun
[2017-03-03 19:33:36 UTC] freewayrickross: just focus on one thing at a time, starting with applying for other partership's
[2017-03-03 19:33:38 UTC] skolvikings944: Cause they werent giving him the answers he wanted
[2017-03-03 19:33:40 UTC] sonsofkojima1: Twitch is the future i think
[2017-03-03 19:33:45 UTC] hippostabber: may have to do things to get viewership up on twitch
[2017-03-03 19:33:51 UTC] aglet57: Is Leanna still partnered? You could use her channel until you find a replacement for yourself
[2017-03-03 19:34:01 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: so just wait until all companies either acept or decline partnership, and sail from there?
[2017-03-03 19:34:02 UTC] podusmonens: terrible idea
[2017-03-03 19:34:03 UTC] skolvikings944: And get no views
[2017-03-03 19:34:04 UTC] skolvikings944: ?
[2017-03-03 19:34:09 UTC] podusmonens: lol
[2017-03-03 19:34:27 UTC] betheboom: full time twitch streaming wont help
[2017-03-03 19:34:31 UTC] sardarkh: So yeah, Part time + Twitch. Record and upload the whole stream on Twitch archive = Awareness + Reviews on Kogaming.
[2017-03-03 19:34:32 UTC] betheboom: AT ALL
[2017-03-03 19:34:39 UTC] aglet57: just throwing every idea out there. Half of them are shit, I know lol
[2017-03-03 19:34:40 UTC] pixofdix: go full on sellout twitch streamer
[2017-03-03 19:34:41 UTC] kg12228: part time job...
[2017-03-03 19:34:48 UTC] sardarkh: With other people it'd be the standard way of life for streamers.
[2017-03-03 19:34:48 UTC] ginosaji48: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rTSFLZMbro
[2017-03-03 19:34:51 UTC] iceyfletch: There are plenty of ways to make very good money on twitch. Becoming a more regular streamer, streaming more watched games (overwatch, etc.), text-to-speech donations, so on so on.
[2017-03-03 19:34:57 UTC] skolvikings944: phil will never get part time job hes said this
[2017-03-03 19:35:08 UTC] podusmonens: not trying to be shitty, but maybe he could ask leanna to put in a good word for him where she works..just a temporary fix
[2017-03-03 19:35:15 UTC] hippostabber: it would if he could get more viewers betheboom but he would have to get more viewers
[2017-03-03 19:35:18 UTC] skolvikings944: he wont do it
[2017-03-03 19:35:21 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: what is your gut telling you phil?
[2017-03-03 19:35:26 UTC] aglet57: True @SkolVikings944 but what happens when a part time job pays more than YT?
[2017-03-03 19:35:34 UTC] aglet57: damn man
[2017-03-03 19:35:35 UTC] skolvikings944: good question
[2017-03-03 19:35:40 UTC] iceyfletch: The truth is you can't keep doing what you're doing now, in this manner, so you're going to have to make some sort of personal compromise and leap of faith Phil.
[2017-03-03 19:35:50 UTC] jojojingo122: Where does Leanna work??
[2017-03-03 19:35:52 UTC] jefffaux1218: He shouldn't do that at all actually. Not because of lack of willingness to work but literally the amount of time and effort that he would have to do that would counter produce against the other things he could be doing.
[2017-03-03 19:36:02 UTC] gaylordbutthump: well, a part time job would pay more than the 0 he's getting now
[2017-03-03 19:36:04 UTC] hapticbabyman: full-time Twitch streaming would work but you'd have to match that w/ better Patreon rewards. The tee spring stuff for example could've been made as Patreon goals once you sold enough, and had the campaign go on longer
[2017-03-03 19:36:04 UTC] skolvikings944: I think she works at bed bath and beyond
[2017-03-03 19:36:05 UTC] thepastryarchy: Tell me this at least. Are we going to see Switch coverage at all today? I love DSP's hardware reviews.
[2017-03-03 19:36:15 UTC] radicaldreamer1: damn no stream today?
[2017-03-03 19:36:20 UTC] radicaldreamer1: what happened? D:
[2017-03-03 19:36:24 UTC] skolvikings944: no @thepastryarchy
[2017-03-03 19:36:26 UTC] hippostabber: regardless something has to change
[2017-03-03 19:36:29 UTC] aglet57: @thepastryarchy Comes in tonight. So maybe if he's up to it
[2017-03-03 19:36:35 UTC] revant_tillywink: Hey, I'm a new viewer, sorry about all that's going on. Is the job market good where you live?
[2017-03-03 19:36:36 UTC] thepastryarchy: Fingers crossed!
[2017-03-03 19:36:42 UTC] betheboom: i need to know if stream is cancelled...
[2017-03-03 19:36:42 UTC] aglet57: I think. I'm in an out of the stream
[2017-03-03 19:36:48 UTC] skolvikings944: @Revant_tillywink, DSP will never get a job that isnt making youtube content
[2017-03-03 19:36:50 UTC] ginosaji48: delayed
[2017-03-03 19:36:52 UTC] podusmonens: !twitter
[2017-03-03 19:36:52 UTC] nightbot: Follow me on Twitter! http://www.twitter.com/theycallmedsp
[2017-03-03 19:36:53 UTC] sardarkh: He started that way tho. As an employee that used games to kill time off. And during those years it was far more honest reactions and fun.
[2017-03-03 19:36:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey Gino
[2017-03-03 19:36:56 UTC] aglet57: But if you're here for Horizon, I wouldnt hold my breath
[2017-03-03 19:36:57 UTC] radicaldreamer1: why tho?
[2017-03-03 19:37:10 UTC] iceyfletch: Unsure if Phil is even still here and reading the advice atm.
[2017-03-03 19:37:16 UTC] radicaldreamer1: is it about what happened yesterday?
[2017-03-03 19:37:18 UTC] podusmonens: bethe
[2017-03-03 19:37:28 UTC] ginosaji48: lol rusev has new look
[2017-03-03 19:37:28 UTC] darksydephil: hang tight folks. i think im going to stream and it'll probably be a totally different kind of stream....if you catch myd rift
[2017-03-03 19:37:30 UTC] podusmonens: Phil‏Verified account @TheyCallMeDSP 35m35 minutes agoFolks, stuff is going down right now and therefore today's stream is delayed until I can sort them out. Sorry, i'll keep you informed.
[2017-03-03 19:37:40 UTC] skolvikings944: what drift????????
[2017-03-03 19:37:40 UTC] nightbot: SkolVikings944 -> Please do not spam symbols, thanks. [warning]
[2017-03-03 19:37:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: impromptu Twitch n chill wooo
[2017-03-03 19:37:48 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: huh what kind?
[2017-03-03 19:37:49 UTC] skolvikings944: what drift
[2017-03-03 19:37:52 UTC] betheboom: gino post pic?
[2017-03-03 19:37:54 UTC] aglet57: Twitch and Chill!
[2017-03-03 19:37:54 UTC] iceyfletch: Twitch and advice session.
[2017-03-03 19:37:57 UTC] ginosaji48: http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/article/rusev-haircut
[2017-03-03 19:38:01 UTC] iceyfletch: He might discuss our ideas and say why they are good/aren't good.
[2017-03-03 19:38:03 UTC] projectrad: lol Phil's gonna hang himself. Get hype!
[2017-03-03 19:38:08 UTC] skolvikings944: are you playing a racing drifting game?
[2017-03-03 19:38:08 UTC] sardarkh: Rage twitch stream
[2017-03-03 19:38:12 UTC] goldencolts: what kind of stream BabyRage BabyRage ???
[2017-03-03 19:38:15 UTC] octoberd: why was phil dropped from machinima
[2017-03-03 19:38:20 UTC] betheboom: ewwwwwwww gino
[2017-03-03 19:38:22 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: this stream is gonna go down in history
[2017-03-03 19:38:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he can't disclose why octoberd
[2017-03-03 19:38:29 UTC] aglet57: no idea @octoberd
[2017-03-03 19:38:33 UTC] freewayrickross: as incredibly redundant
[2017-03-03 19:38:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn bit much Projectrad
[2017-03-03 19:38:39 UTC] aglet57: There's clearly drama
[2017-03-03 19:38:44 UTC] sardarkh: Without having anything to lose, I'd disclose it asap
[2017-03-03 19:38:45 UTC] skolvikings944: hey Gino whats up dude
[2017-03-03 19:38:53 UTC] iceyfletch: I'd wager a guess at "sorry phil, you're too much trouble right now, and we frankly don't give enough of a fuck"?
[2017-03-03 19:39:02 UTC] radicaldreamer1: Hey Darksydephil i hope you aren't in trouble :_:
[2017-03-03 19:39:03 UTC] ginosaji48: nothing, you ?
[2017-03-03 19:39:07 UTC] octoberd: he just said a few days ago that machinima was "going to bat for him" among the ad shit on youtube, strange how things have changed so quickly
[2017-03-03 19:39:13 UTC] podusmonens: it's not the worst thing in the world tho
[2017-03-03 19:39:15 UTC] betheboom: you still in hospital gino
[2017-03-03 19:39:18 UTC] darksydephil: i really dont have much to lose. and making more gameplay right now might not necessarily help anything
[2017-03-03 19:39:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: such is life octoberd
[2017-03-03 19:39:31 UTC] skolvikings944: Q&A stream?
[2017-03-03 19:39:32 UTC] radicaldreamer1: I was just reading your tweets - sounds horrible what happened there
[2017-03-03 19:39:39 UTC] ginosaji48: i dont even know when im going home bethe so no
[2017-03-03 19:39:39 UTC] iceyfletch: Phil, seriously, stream and let us think tank together
[2017-03-03 19:39:41 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: just let it all out phil
[2017-03-03 19:39:43 UTC] iceyfletch: come up with ideas, pros and cons.
[2017-03-03 19:39:46 UTC] sardarkh: Horizon is better to be played than stremed anyways.
[2017-03-03 19:40:01 UTC] betheboom: phil but you can keep the videos for when you are partnered then upload them over time
[2017-03-03 19:40:08 UTC] supremedeadly: DO A FLIP
[2017-03-03 19:40:08 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: get everything off your chest
[2017-03-03 19:40:10 UTC] aglet57: Stream a game that will take your mind off of things. Something mindless. WWE or something. Those are always fun.
[2017-03-03 19:40:21 UTC] hapticbabyman: DSP, it's time to shift more focus on Twitch. Host other streamers playing games, and they'll host you back. That's exposure. Make the Patreon goals better; people gotta get something out of it too. The teespring stuff could be offered as Patreon goals; just make exclusive stuff for Patreons. Do game sponsorships, and focus more on retro games and legit rage at them. Just make sure people know it's for fun, like AVGN does it.
[2017-03-03 19:40:22 UTC] eternia_forever: Ignorant Gaming Nerds new zelda 10 - - 10
[2017-03-03 19:40:22 UTC] ollyorange: forbidden siren forbidden siren!
[2017-03-03 19:40:24 UTC] aglet57: Or that one you play on Jack
[2017-03-03 19:40:40 UTC] podusmonens: time for phil to get into league of legends
[2017-03-03 19:40:43 UTC] radicaldreamer1: yeah hosting some people wouldn't be a bad idea
[2017-03-03 19:40:44 UTC] hapticbabyman: And do more streams with Leanna when you both have the time
[2017-03-03 19:40:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil could another redemption run
[2017-03-03 19:40:48 UTC] aglet57: If anything, I mean. If you're not up to it, don't force yourself. You don't owe us anythnig
[2017-03-03 19:40:50 UTC] theycallmejimbob: do*
[2017-03-03 19:41:02 UTC] radicaldreamer1: thats a good idea Jimbob =)
[2017-03-03 19:41:06 UTC] aglet57: Red Dead Redemption Redemption Run
[2017-03-03 19:41:10 UTC] burnout26: I see DSP is playing the game called IRL
[2017-03-03 19:41:12 UTC] supremedeadly: is this twitch and chill again?
[2017-03-03 19:41:20 UTC] radicaldreamer1: and this time he should choose the game by himself
[2017-03-03 19:41:22 UTC] sardarkh: At this point gaming should og back to the old, original thing. Just once in a while. Hell I'd be fine even with a 3 hours session every week.
[2017-03-03 19:41:24 UTC] iceyfletch: Don't bother with gameplay right now. Now is the time to focus and get the shit sorted while the fire is still hot.
[2017-03-03 19:41:29 UTC] podusmonens: radicaldreamer phil has had that lone wolf mentality for a while now
[2017-03-03 19:41:31 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: mystery stream today, hype
[2017-03-03 19:41:40 UTC] radicaldreamer1: i know
[2017-03-03 19:41:55 UTC] podusmonens: so hosting who?
[2017-03-03 19:42:11 UTC] betheboom: this sucks for phil especially and us fans of phil who just wanna be here and watch him play a game and chat, heck even the trolls would miss phil
[2017-03-03 19:42:15 UTC] radicaldreamer1: good question
[2017-03-03 19:42:22 UTC] supremedeadly: hey, when is stream starting
[2017-03-03 19:42:25 UTC] supremedeadly: ?
[2017-03-03 19:42:34 UTC] splitplaythru: no stream today most likely
[2017-03-03 19:42:35 UTC] skolvikings944: dont know
[2017-03-03 19:42:42 UTC] skolvikings944: dsp said he is gonna do a "different" stream
[2017-03-03 19:42:49 UTC] skolvikings944: something about a drift? idk what he meant by that
[2017-03-03 19:42:50 UTC] dxfreedom: what where when?
[2017-03-03 19:42:55 UTC] dxfreedom: why is there no stream
[2017-03-03 19:43:00 UTC] supremedeadly: is it a twitch and stream?
[2017-03-03 19:43:16 UTC] skolvikings944: doubt it
[2017-03-03 19:43:19 UTC] welshryosuke: "if you catch my drift" it's an expression
[2017-03-03 19:43:24 UTC] sardarkh: And if we have to come to a goodbye, I'd just spit everything out clearly, so to not leave anything to be bended by the haters on their propaganda.
[2017-03-03 19:43:31 UTC] goldencolts: if you catch the cut of my jib
[2017-03-03 19:43:31 UTC] supremedeadly: can we just relax
[2017-03-03 19:43:37 UTC] darksydephil: ok so im going to stream but its not going to be anything like id planned. im going to tell everyone what's going on to the best of my ability and try to get advice/help. just like i did when i lost my office job in 2010
[2017-03-03 19:43:49 UTC] goldencolts: ok cool
[2017-03-03 19:43:50 UTC] iceyfletch: Let's do it.
[2017-03-03 19:43:51 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: full circle
[2017-03-03 19:43:53 UTC] darksydephil: i think thats the best way to go

[2017-03-03 19:46:35 UTC] misterlightningbolt: What time does the eulogy start?
[2017-03-03 19:46:38 UTC] sardarkh: Hell, if it's house area was serviced by buses, I'd take that to reach any fucking part-time job. And I'd couple that with a weekly stream, plus the reviews etc.
[2017-03-03 19:46:45 UTC] littleflower1995: @DarksydePhil Bullshit. Every person partner with them says they have that with them. XD

[2017-03-03 19:49:25 UTC] jojojingo122: Aren't Gino and Bethe a couple?
[2017-03-03 19:49:27 UTC] rbreezay: Phil should be a full time TwitchTV streamer. Part time YouTuber. Add face cam every playthru. Notifications on the side of the stream when subscribers sub, donate & cheer. People love seeing their names. I'm sorry but try a playthru without uploading "raw gameplay".
[2017-03-03 19:49:30 UTC] dejectedsanta: maybe some good will come out of this, pandalee might give him a pity handjob

[2017-03-03 19:49:52 UTC] kg12228: when is the stream
[2017-03-03 19:49:56 UTC] hero2zerooo: What's going on?
[2017-03-03 19:49:57 UTC] philtheboss2367: I've been away for a few weeks
[2017-03-03 19:50:02 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I think he's gonna quit YT guys
[2017-03-03 19:50:02 UTC] coffeemode: in for the endgame
[2017-03-03 19:50:09 UTC] darksydephil: okay, going to grab some drinks and then we'll get started
[2017-03-03 19:50:16 UTC] mesonak: I am quite curious as to what's going on
[2017-03-03 19:50:18 UTC] octoberd: I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side, he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.
[2017-03-03 19:50:19 UTC] freewayrickross: what kiiind of drinks
[2017-03-03 19:50:19 UTC] mesonak: Stay strong Phil
[2017-03-03 19:50:20 UTC] philtheboss2367: Phil don't leave

[2017-03-03 19:50:25 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: well, full time twitch sounds reasonable
[2017-03-03 19:50:28 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Rbreezay I'd add he should do more retro games to that, spruce up the Patreon w/ some solid rewards like exclusive TeeSpring merch
[2017-03-03 19:50:43 UTC] coffeemode: twitch takes time to grow
[2017-03-03 19:50:46 UTC] sardarkh: Well, at this point fuck youtube. Kogaming is the only thing left shaped in the way YT wants things to generally be.
[2017-03-03 19:50:48 UTC] yacherdy: I will live my life as I'll undoubtedly die....alone Kreygasm
[2017-03-03 19:50:50 UTC] kg12228: when does stream start
[2017-03-03 19:50:52 UTC] philtheboss2367: Guys we should all donate now more then ever
[2017-03-03 19:50:52 UTC] coffeemode: no matter how many hours you throw at it
[2017-03-03 19:51:05 UTC] garydai: how long has phil been streaming on twitch?
[2017-03-03 19:51:08 UTC] bigtwerk: there's other people who just upload their raw gameplay and they're still successful tho lol
[2017-03-03 19:51:09 UTC] ziibrah: just joined, looks like I missed something big lol
[2017-03-03 19:51:09 UTC] hero2zerooo: Can you make a living out of doing live twitch streams
[2017-03-03 19:51:14 UTC] califlower: Did machinima got mad when he said: "Michinama has said... *bla*"
[2017-03-03 19:51:16 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Few months, since Final Fantasy
[2017-03-03 19:51:20 UTC] podusmonens: every man is an island, cherdy
[2017-03-03 19:51:21 UTC] hero2zerooo: Dumb question I know haha
[2017-03-03 19:51:32 UTC] coffeemode: you can hero, but it's incredibly difficult and a tiny percentage make enough to live on
[2017-03-03 19:51:35 UTC] kg12228: I mean Phil has said "fuck you machinima" plenty of times
[2017-03-03 19:51:38 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Wonder if Phil left or got sacked from Machinima
[2017-03-03 19:51:38 UTC] skolvikings944: he cant TALK ABOUT MACHINIMA
[2017-03-03 19:51:41 UTC] skolvikings944: JESUS

[2017-03-03 19:52:13 UTC] ohgodohman09: Get fucked Phil!

[2017-03-03 19:52:13 UTC] hero2zerooo: @coffeemode Okay mangoCoach
[2017-03-03 19:52:15 UTC] freewayrickross: He never said anyting bad on Machinima that I heard but he definitely insulted the youtube gods which is his bosses boss
[2017-03-03 19:52:18 UTC] mesonak: He's switching partnership companies, that's all we know
[2017-03-03 19:52:19 UTC] skolvikings944: they broke up..thats all he can tell us
[2017-03-03 19:52:21 UTC] sardarkh: Full time streaming is stressfull beyond understanding. It should just be a side thing, over a steady income.
[2017-03-03 19:52:23 UTC] coffeemode: machinima fired phil prob for talking about his contract details
[2017-03-03 19:52:26 UTC] axejaw: phils business is in danger?
[2017-03-03 19:52:29 UTC] podusmonens: I guess the trolls are celebrating

[2017-03-03 19:54:23 UTC] coffeemode: you cant monetize nintendo videos without a multi channel network protecting you, he wont upload zelda stuff till this is sorted out
[2017-03-03 19:54:24 UTC] jwalker70: if his opinion is that he want phil to lose job hes a horrible person
[2017-03-03 19:54:26 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: one or two beers now seems appropriate
[2017-03-03 19:54:27 UTC] jefffaux1218: I'm not on anyones side in this. But honestly its really cunty to just sit there and laugh at someone for not doing well.
[2017-03-03 19:54:29 UTC] cplkevlar: we starting?
[2017-03-03 19:54:33 UTC] rbreezay: 3rd time phil said he getting a drink. Is this a drunken playthru?
[2017-03-03 19:54:36 UTC] philtheboss2367: Who knows if Zelda will be tomorrow
[2017-03-03 19:54:41 UTC] misterlightningbolt: Fred gets too much of a hard time, there was 1300 people watching the sokast last night so its clearly not a one man show
[2017-03-03 19:54:44 UTC] podusmonens: he can moneize the drama, at least lol
[2017-03-03 19:54:49 UTC] podusmonens: monetize
[2017-03-03 19:54:50 UTC] bigtwerk: they find comedy in watching phil, they don't want to hurt his business. sure they've done bad stuff at times but that doesn't automatically make you a bad person
[2017-03-03 19:54:56 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Who knows if Phil's gonna be playing games anymore after today :/
[2017-03-03 19:55:01 UTC] hero2zerooo: Waiting for the walking dead the new frontier episode 3. Supposed to be out today.
[2017-03-03 19:55:01 UTC] podusmonens: I'm sober and still can't type
[2017-03-03 19:55:02 UTC] rbreezay: He said he'll brb and get a drink, THREE TIMES

[2017-03-03 19:55:37 UTC] bentboxer: phil will drink however much as he pleases
[2017-03-03 19:55:38 UTC] taurusoxford: @BlinkJournal He can't play Zelda without a partner company - Nintendo will steal every cent he makes off the videos

[2017-03-03 19:56:04 UTC] blinkjournal: @TaurusOxford Ah okay thanks for letting me know
[2017-03-03 19:56:14 UTC] mesonak: Zelda is basically off the table until he gets set up again because of Nintendo's ridiculous Content ID Policies
[2017-03-03 19:56:20 UTC] rbreezay: @yacherdy THIS
[2017-03-03 19:56:21 UTC] bentboxer: subscribe to phils channel ya filthy animals

[2017-03-03 19:56:42 UTC] yacherdy: For some reason, I doubt Machinima contracts are like 9-5 office jobs.
[2017-03-03 19:56:45 UTC] darkhero33: lol
[2017-03-03 19:56:46 UTC] yacherdy: no 2 week notice
[2017-03-03 19:56:56 UTC] duderito2: Fred is incredibly thinskinned he made a long video because someone tweeted he was leaving his group and what they were doing was wrong. For someone who criticizes Phil all the time seems like he can't take criticism himself
[2017-03-03 19:56:56 UTC] misterlightningbolt: Cant Phil use Leannas channel for his unboxing and Zelda playtrhoughs as she is still with machinma?
[2017-03-03 19:56:57 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Doubt Machinima is covered by employment law
[2017-03-03 19:57:05 UTC] bigtwerk: he breached his contract by giving out his CPM
[2017-03-03 19:57:08 UTC] califlower: somebody have an idea what happened with machinima?
[2017-03-03 19:57:17 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I think they cut ties with him
[2017-03-03 19:57:18 UTC] jefffaux1218: Yes.
[2017-03-03 19:57:23 UTC] kg12228: Phil constantly says fuck YouTube fuck machinima i don't get it don't they pay him?
[2017-03-03 19:57:23 UTC] jefffaux1218: You mean with machinima in general?
[2017-03-03 19:57:23 UTC] bentboxer: phil falls under what category in terms of employment?
[2017-03-03 19:57:26 UTC] yacherdy: machinima head boss probably watched Phil's vid
[2017-03-03 19:57:30 UTC] dannyhikari: i heard phil broke the rules discussing how much he got paid
[2017-03-03 19:57:32 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Self employed
[2017-03-03 19:57:33 UTC] jefffaux1218: Machinima in general is a fucking mess.
[2017-03-03 19:57:34 UTC] gaylordbutthump: from what i've heard from people who told horror stories about machinima, there is a month or two notice you have to give if you want out of your contract
[2017-03-03 19:57:35 UTC] roflsteaks: what's up nerds
[2017-03-03 19:57:39 UTC] eternia_forever: normally heineken but for some reason i got natural ice lol and i have not started drinking Yet @FreewayRickRoss
[2017-03-03 19:57:42 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: i thought they were going to bat for him?
[2017-03-03 19:57:44 UTC] philtheboss2367: Phil left Machinima
[2017-03-03 19:57:47 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey roflsteaks
[2017-03-03 19:57:47 UTC] coffeemode: Phil is an independant contractor, he's only bound by the terms of the contract
[2017-03-03 19:57:49 UTC] bigtwerk: @gaylordbutthump MCNs can't make you wait to leave now
[2017-03-03 19:57:51 UTC] hapticbabyman: @YaCherdy That's definitely possible. This stuff doesn't happen in a vacuum
[2017-03-03 19:57:52 UTC] rbreezay: Machinima is unprofessional. They must do jack shit at headquarters
[2017-03-03 19:57:54 UTC] coffeemode: he's not employed by machinima and not employed by youtube
[2017-03-03 19:57:56 UTC] gaylordbutthump: and usually they ignore you or give you the run around if you want out
[2017-03-03 19:57:56 UTC] califlower: But why would phil leave machinima?
[2017-03-03 19:58:01 UTC] podusmonens: screw machinima, I'm sick of hearing about it. let's just chill mkay
[2017-03-03 19:58:05 UTC] gaylordbutthump: oh, that's a new thing
[2017-03-03 19:58:05 UTC] yacherdy: he probably saw it and was like "....uh....no"
[2017-03-03 19:58:06 UTC] bigtwerk: Machinima is mostly the owners and interns.
[2017-03-03 19:58:09 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Phil is a partner, not an employee, they can cancel that agreeement anytime
[2017-03-03 19:58:11 UTC] dinohans: personal reasons
[2017-03-03 19:58:16 UTC] ginosaji48: now phil is a free agent so he can join SoK Kappa
[2017-03-03 19:58:18 UTC] gaylordbutthump: most of what i know is from people like videogamedunkey

[2017-03-03 19:58:52 UTC] roflsteaks: phil today reveals his true identity as Fred Fuchs the head of SoK ;)

[2017-03-03 19:59:20 UTC] kg12228: SOK wants Leanna
[2017-03-03 19:59:24 UTC] dnoltie87: Lets not play dumb here guys. They dropped Phil for breach of contract he revealed too much in his recent videos. Phil is going to try to spin it and put the blame on Machinima though. I'ts never his fault.
[2017-03-03 19:59:26 UTC] dxfreedom: punished phil
[2017-03-03 19:59:27 UTC] jefffaux1218: This is the start of the "Broken Phil" era. Like Broken Matt Hardy

[2017-03-03 19:59:36 UTC] sardarkh: Machinima gave him a great chance in 2010 when he was laid off, but the overall revenue potential has drastically changed since then.
[2017-03-03 19:59:37 UTC] bigtwerk: He's already broken Phil, he deletes all the negative criticism
[2017-03-03 19:59:38 UTC] ttsbb1: Hey Phil, SoKast when

[2017-03-03 22:01:09 UTC] freelancerkitty: @DarksydePhil don't do full-time twitch, it'll burn you out completely, you'll hate everything eventually and things will be worse
[2017-03-03 22:01:09 UTC] owenage55: e safe option, is getting your channel partnered again. the risk, is going full time to twitch. in order to go full time on Twitch, you need pop of graphics/noises for cheers, subs, donations, plus allow people to write you messages when they sub/donate. that being said, you can still focus on the game while you stream, just take time to read the messages, shout out/thank the people who sub/donate/cheer, and interact with chat a lot. be a fun person on stream make chat have a good time.

He interacts with his audience on stream and streams 8 hours plus about 4 times a week if he isn't busy. He had like 3.5K people for Horizon last night. When streaming fulltime it's about the interaction and making it fun for everyone. Set up streamlabs for donations, subs, bits, etc. and get notifications that popup on stream. Literally the minimum you have to do would be thank the guy for a sub or whatever

[2017-03-03 22:03:05 UTC] owenage55: e safe option, is getting your channel partnered again. the risk, is going full time to twitch. in order to go full time on Twitch, you need pop of graphics/noises for cheers, subs, donations, plus allow people to write you messages when they sub/donate. that being said, you can still focus on the game while you stream, just take time to read the messages, shout out/thank the people who sub/donate/cheer, and interact with chat a lot. be a fun person on stream make chat have a good time.

[2017-03-03 22:05:51 UTC] bradleymason1993: @Darksydephil, the more you ignore the trolls, the less interested they'll be in trolling. I know its hard to not get pissed with them, but they crave attention lol

[2017-03-03 22:05:54 UTC] cheesehovel: Nice pop filter
[2017-03-03 22:05:54 UTC] dehumanizer86: Phil, you're making 1300 bucks through patreon, you already got a sub button on twitch, YT is making you some money too and your girl is earning too. If that puts you on the brink of financial ruin, you gotta face the fact that you don't know how to manage your finances.
[2017-03-03 22:05:55 UTC] freelancerkitty: @DarksydePhil flip a coin, heads try job, tails try twitch, whichever it is throw yourself into it wholeheartedly
[2017-03-03 22:05:55 UTC] owenage55: e safe option, is getting your channel partnered again. the risk, is going full time to twitch. in order to go full time on Twitch, you need pop of graphics/noises for cheers, subs, donations, plus allow people to write you messages when they sub/donate. that being said, you can still focus on the game while you stream, just take time to read the messages, shout out/thank the people who sub/donate/cheer, and interact with chat a lot. be a fun person on stream make chat have a good time.
[2017-03-03 22:05:55 UTC] itstommytakeover: Try to make peace with your haters. ACTUALLY TRY. LISTEN TO THEM.

[2017-03-03 22:07:44 UTC] hurtboxtv: The thing is with twitch it's much more stable because instead of a wishy washy ad based CPM you're getting half of each sub's 5 dollars every month. The more your channel grows the more subs you get = more money.
[2017-03-03 22:07:44 UTC] minticorn: Go on sokast.

[2017-03-03 22:07:50 UTC] modsformemes: Phil, I strongly suggest getting a fast food job in the short term. The application process wouldn't be that involved, and I'm afraid Twitch won't be a stable source of income even in the short term.
[2017-03-03 22:07:51 UTC] katyas131: @markymark52 ever look in a mirror?
[2017-03-03 22:07:51 UTC] rickforthewin: Go on the SoKcast and have a discussion with them, they aren't just 'out to get you' it'd show how mature you can be about this.

I always thought that it would ruin it and get in the way, but then I started watching streamers like Lobos and he mixes it in very nicely and his stuff is still very watchable on youtube
[2017-03-03 22:08:04 UTC] phasair: sooo... did he leave machinima or did machinima kick him?
[2017-03-03 22:08:05 UTC] freelancerkitty: @DarksydePhil Sokast isn't a bad idea, you could at least get views off it

[2017-03-03 22:09:44 UTC] owenage55: Phil, the reason you can't do what you do now on Twitch, is that people hop on stream aren't going to like you going hard on a game. they want to have a good time for when they hop on whether it be for 10 minutes or 2 hours. what I'm saying is make your streams appealing for anyone to hop on and have fun, it takes both the game and the steamer

[2017-03-03 22:15:12 UTC] hurtboxtv: NO, you can get away with gaming videos but the problem is with your main youtube channel. almost nobody has time to watch all the videos you upload. if you uploaded say 2 or 3 maybe even 4 10 minute Let's play videos then you'd have much more ad friendly and viewer friendly content. 10 minute videos allow for more ad rolls and such. Every so often upload a 30 minute video or something if it were say an epic boss fight. but this is what YT let's plays are now. cut out the long uninteresting stuf

[2017-03-03 22:28:20 UTC] dxfreedom: There were some solid tips giving. I think going full twitch is the way to go. But it indeed requires a change within phil himself and how he does things (and that is hard, changing who you or how you have been doing things is hard). But I Bolieve
[2017-03-03 22:28:23 UTC] playcool18: I dont twitch will be enough, and I wont support it, sorry but no, I love the content he does on youtube
[2017-03-03 22:28:23 UTC] fatmansthong: Phasair YEP i thought so
[2017-03-03 22:28:24 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: If he did Twitch full time he would have more time to review games cause he would finish faster and have 1 free day a week to upload on KO
[2017-03-03 22:28:26 UTC] ginosaji48: @Alukart177 damn man you got me
[2017-03-03 22:28:26 UTC] xxgaming_dragonxx: what i miss

[2017-03-03 22:28:39 UTC] bathman135: he could get at job at pornhub
[2017-03-03 22:28:45 UTC] babbyrage: full time twitch will be the end of him
[2017-03-03 22:28:47 UTC] ginosaji48: walmart
[2017-03-03 22:28:53 UTC] alukart177: @Ginosaji48, KappaCool
[2017-03-03 22:29:09 UTC] boxman222: Ginosaji48: do you really think it would be such a bad idea for him to reach out to SoKast?
[2017-03-03 22:29:10 UTC] grandmasterii: the people building the wall making good money
[2017-03-03 22:29:14 UTC] insaiyan9000: day in the life videos, what you do for other 21h

[2017-03-03 22:29:25 UTC] bitwjoe: He doesn't have it in him to do twitch full time
[2017-03-03 22:29:47 UTC] ginosaji48: idk boxman
[2017-03-03 22:29:51 UTC] froztey: he did YT full time so well BrokeBack BrokeBack
[2017-03-03 22:29:54 UTC] ginosaji48: maybe
[2017-03-03 22:29:58 UTC] butter__my__bread: phil could do go pro. vids on his way to work at McDonald's
[2017-03-03 22:29:59 UTC] xxgaming_dragonxx: did he decides to be full time?
[2017-03-03 22:30:02 UTC] astralabstraction: lol, Social Grilling
[2017-03-03 22:30:03 UTC] phasair: He seems to be really worried about changing his content style, it seems to me like he's so used to his current style, I wonder how easy he can adapt to twitch
[2017-03-03 22:30:04 UTC] boxman222: it would take a long time to build up success on twitch i think and that is time he probably does not have
[2017-03-03 22:30:07 UTC] grandmasterii: I would think sitting in 1 spot streaming for 8 hours would be more bad on your back tgan anything
[2017-03-03 22:30:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he seemed to be leaning towards that Xxgaming_dragonxx
[2017-03-03 22:30:20 UTC] fatmansthong: Welp time to check eddys twitter! and wait for the SOK podcast!
[2017-03-03 22:30:37 UTC] butter__my__bread: !uptime

[2017-03-03 22:30:39 UTC] argylegroove: machinima confirmed detractor
[2017-03-03 22:30:45 UTC] sabfrab: I mean if he won't make money off Youtube and can't get a job outside of YT/Twitch, there's not a whole lot of choice beyond going full streamer
[2017-03-03 22:30:46 UTC] bitwjoe: He honestly should just vlog about his life that's what people want to see, these videos get more views then anything else
[2017-03-03 22:30:50 UTC] bodiebthewire: phil tries it:Getting a real job so he stops begging people for money
[2017-03-03 22:31:01 UTC] babbyrage: he didn't decide yet, apparently he hopes that a new partner contract will fall from heaven during the weekend lmao
[2017-03-03 22:31:04 UTC] froztey: professional patreoner
[2017-03-03 22:31:12 UTC] butter__my__bread: i missed thw whole stream :(
[2017-03-03 22:31:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he's uploading it on YT Butter__My__Bread
[2017-03-03 22:32:01 UTC] astralabstraction: How long does it take for a 2 hour long video to show up on Youtube?
[2017-03-03 22:32:06 UTC] bodiebthewire: he can get a real job....why does he act as if its this or nothing....welcome to the real world where people need to have jobs to live
[2017-03-03 22:32:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: depends on you intyernet
[2017-03-03 22:32:10 UTC] fatmansthong: butter quick summery -talked about how machinima sdont exist--wanting to find a new partnet--asked for advice--took no advice (they all wont work)
[2017-03-03 22:32:33 UTC] argylegroove: bodiebthewire because he refuses to work.
[2017-03-03 22:32:35 UTC] bitwjoe: Ahhhah asked for advice-took no advice ahahH
[2017-03-03 22:32:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I think doing a video that length the main point of it gets muddied a bit.
[2017-03-03 22:32:51 UTC] phasair: "I need to change my content, any advice? Nah, that won't work, I don't want to change anything about my current content"
[2017-03-03 22:32:58 UTC] bodiebthewire: khantent
[2017-03-03 22:33:03 UTC] butter__my__bread: LMAO^
[2017-03-03 22:33:05 UTC] ambervisage: He considered the advice, obviously none was waiting for him to snap and go "Good advice, im going to do that right now"
[2017-03-03 22:33:15 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Chat was flooded tbh
[2017-03-03 22:33:33 UTC] bitwjoe: as if he knows what he's talking about with the suggestions he was given like he knew the future
[2017-03-03 22:33:36 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: severely
[2017-03-03 22:33:56 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I must say his argument about the US being easy to move to is absolute BS
[2017-03-03 22:34:19 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Did he get subs/bits during stream, I had chat close
[2017-03-03 22:34:20 UTC] groj_: @Royal_Phalanx91 Yeah he was talking out of his ass on that one.
[2017-03-03 22:34:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he did neon
[2017-03-03 22:34:27 UTC] bodiebthewire: honestly i feel bad for him.....but he made so many mistakes.....raw unedited gameplay doesnt work as a "business" but hes to lazy to edit and to cheap to throw money to have someone help him do it
[2017-03-03 22:34:27 UTC] hotcakes28: missed pitty show phil in crises again Shrugs
[2017-03-03 22:34:41 UTC] fatmansthong: he got subs and bits during the stream but didn't say anything..even at the end
[2017-03-03 22:34:54 UTC] argylegroove: i love that his switch hasn't shown up yet either.
[2017-03-03 22:34:58 UTC] boxman222: he should have listened to my suggestion ages ago to try to cover something different than the usual AAA gams
[2017-03-03 22:35:06 UTC] hotcakes28: he needs job
[2017-03-03 22:35:08 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: just forgot maybe
[2017-03-03 22:35:14 UTC] bodiebthewire: thats because you own him bits and cheers....what do you think
[2017-03-03 22:35:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Are bus services that bad in Washington?
[2017-03-03 22:35:32 UTC] bitwjoe: I hate how he thinks it redeems himself when he was saying I made many mistakes as if he was owning up to any of it...
[2017-03-03 22:35:33 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Apparently pretty bad
[2017-03-03 22:35:49 UTC] theycallmejimbob: how does anyone else without a car get to work Royal_Phalanx91?
[2017-03-03 22:35:54 UTC] fatmansthong: you want aexample of a unique twitch streamer?..Cobaltstreak..how can someone play the same game for...5 years? and still produce interesting content..no idea..but he does!
[2017-03-03 22:35:54 UTC] bodiebthewire: he should have gotten on pc.....there is an audience for pc that he never tapped in to
[2017-03-03 22:35:59 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Bus services in my HS were pretty shit, I woul imagine so.
[2017-03-03 22:36:03 UTC] bitwjoe: all he has to do is go to work earlier to fix the bus problem
[2017-03-03 22:36:04 UTC] royal_phalanx91: They just deal with it and take a bus
[2017-03-03 22:36:08 UTC] hotcakes28: is he gonna quit? he says that everytine
[2017-03-03 22:36:45 UTC] bitwjoe: go to work at 9? Find a bus at 7 there is no possible way all of them will skip him
[2017-03-03 22:36:46 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: If he got a super cheap car instead of the expensive one he has now he would've been better.
[2017-03-03 22:36:46 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he seems to leaning towards becoming a full time streamer if he doesn't find a channel partner HotCakes28. On a sidenote we don't need slow mode anymore :(
[2017-03-03 22:36:49 UTC] bodiebthewire: he also shoulsnt have moved that really hurt him
[2017-03-03 22:36:56 UTC] phasair: Will pandalee leave him? ;(
[2017-03-03 22:36:57 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I'm spoiled by decent public transport where I live admittedly, I wouldn't know what they're like where Phil lives
[2017-03-03 22:37:03 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: the PC poor race isn't gonna cheer
[2017-03-03 22:37:06 UTC] 1buttondash: i just got here, he's done streamin for the day>
[2017-03-03 22:37:16 UTC] bitwjoe: regardless it can be fixed by leaving earlier
[2017-03-03 22:37:20 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Bitwjoe, you're right plus there is a good chance a co worker lives close by that could give him a lift
[2017-03-03 22:37:35 UTC] phasair: @1ButtonDash, he said he would stream the nintendo switch unboxing later tonight once it arrives
[2017-03-03 22:37:44 UTC] 1buttondash: ahh ok thx
[2017-03-03 22:37:57 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Also couldn't Leanna drive him? She does work a 9-5 as well right?
[2017-03-03 22:38:06 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he streamed a 2 hour vlog 1ButtonDash no gameplay
[2017-03-03 22:38:14 UTC] bitwjoe: if it's a matter of time then drop her off earlier like at 8 and she can just wait til 9
[2017-03-03 22:38:36 UTC] bodiebthewire: Phil‏Verified account @TheyCallMeDSPJust finished my impromptu stream which lasted 2 hours and included not only my explaining everything but fielding suggestions as well
[2017-03-03 22:38:38 UTC] hotcakes28: No one should give him money. Seriouslt its like a pitty show . Hes a GROWN MAN wit no Job
[2017-03-03 22:38:47 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Maybe he can ride one of those Tricycles that has a layback seat EleGiggle
[2017-03-03 22:38:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I thought she had a part time job Royal_Phalanx91? Can slow mode be turned off :(
[2017-03-03 22:39:02 UTC] bitwjoe: fielding suggestions? Wow...
[2017-03-03 22:39:23 UTC] bodiebthewire: hes a freaking adult that acts like a 13 year old and also in an internet panhandler
[2017-03-03 22:39:44 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Still, I believe Leanna could drive him jimbob
[2017-03-03 22:39:57 UTC] bodiebthewire: panda lee is gonna leave his ass now......shes sliding into dm's on the low
[2017-03-03 22:40:03 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: who can blame a man for wanting to live easy and luxurious life
[2017-03-03 22:40:15 UTC] ambervisage: detractors very well know how to act like a 13 year old, so apparently there is nothing wrong with that.
[2017-03-03 22:40:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Royal_Phalanx91, I think there are enough options to not need a car regardless
[2017-03-03 22:40:37 UTC] hotcakes28: lol so true . phil wants a easy life
[2017-03-03 22:40:40 UTC] masternutella: The stream done?
[2017-03-03 22:40:40 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Looked up Seattle jobs and there are some decent enough jobs in his area
[2017-03-03 22:40:44 UTC] bodiebthewire: thing is....what do the detractors say that isnt true?
[2017-03-03 22:41:06 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: He should consider applying to jobs, giving a resume with his work on youtube/twitch to prove his creditability. He's a good speaker, and has been running a small business on his own. It's somewhat impressive he's still around just on this and his fans.
[2017-03-03 22:41:20 UTC] dukaduka: @Royal_Phalanx91, application roulette man...
[2017-03-03 22:41:26 UTC] boxman222: AmberVisage: this kind of generalizing is one of the main reasons why phil is where he is now
[2017-03-03 22:41:31 UTC] bitwjoe: It's not impressive when you are begging every month
[2017-03-03 22:41:33 UTC] hotcakes28: YES theres jobs out there that pay well Phill will say otherwise lol
[2017-03-03 22:41:42 UTC] ambervisage: And who the fuck put the "detractors" in charge? Since when did his "detractors" become heavenly beings who judge other people for not being perfect?
[2017-03-03 22:41:51 UTC] dukaduka: @Royal_Phalanx91, he may even be able to apply as a social media manager for a company or something
[2017-03-03 22:41:59 UTC] boxman222: some people do legitimitely hate his guts, but some do also want to see him actually change
[2017-03-03 22:42:05 UTC] bodiebthewire: he can get a job at gamestop LOL he knows a lot about upcoming games
[2017-03-03 22:42:05 UTC] bitwjoe: This is a horrible situation for anyone to be in and no one should sugarcoat it
[2017-03-03 22:42:11 UTC] hotcakes28: INDEED.com is ur friend
[2017-03-03 22:42:11 UTC] nightbot: HotCakes28 -> You're nothin' but scrap metal. [stop posting links] [warning]
[2017-03-03 22:42:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yeah but the line is very blurry boxman222
[2017-03-03 22:42:34 UTC] boxman222: at least trying to make peace and understandting their point of view, could at least maybe change the mind of at least some and that would be worth it
[2017-03-03 22:42:50 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I suggested US Customs and TSA to him because they pay very well and have good benefits, but he might not be able to get it because of his back and TSA aren't recruiting in his area
[2017-03-03 22:43:12 UTC] bitwjoe: Phil will forever be followed by trolls until he gets the idea of ignoring them and no he hasn't tried that
[2017-03-03 22:43:12 UTC] hotcakes28: Yup great jobs out there
[2017-03-03 22:43:40 UTC] bodiebthewire: is he the only one with detractors? ....no but its how he acts that gives ammo.....if he would just be normal fro a month or two it would die down but he cant help him self
[2017-03-03 22:43:43 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I guess Bitwjoe he does take the bait sometimes
[2017-03-03 22:43:54 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: so tonight is unboxing in about 4 hours
[2017-03-03 22:43:59 UTC] bitwjoe: all the time
[2017-03-03 22:44:11 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: yeah so hype
[2017-03-03 22:44:15 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Phil does encourage a lot of the drama on occasion, yeah
[2017-03-03 22:44:29 UTC] hotcakes28: wat was stream about. ahis car
[2017-03-03 22:44:31 UTC] ambervisage: If he would just be "normal"
[2017-03-03 22:44:48 UTC] bodiebthewire: yes.....not begging people for money
[2017-03-03 22:44:52 UTC] annabac: its also his personality, it's fun to see a rage moment, but not for hours, make a pleasant watching space
[2017-03-03 22:45:08 UTC] ambervisage: "Im gonna be normal for all the nice little friends out there so they dont take a piss out on me"
[2017-03-03 22:45:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I was thinking the same HotCakes28 :D I don't really know the main point of it. I'm not sure how many people have Youtube partner contacts
[2017-03-03 22:45:25 UTC] bitwjoe: he pretty much told them that the way they act is working to mess up his life so of course they are going to do more of it
[2017-03-03 22:45:25 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I think his personality is also pretty abrasive at times with all his rants and insults about other people
[2017-03-03 22:45:28 UTC] bodiebthewire: its people like you thats the reason he doesnt change
[2017-03-03 22:45:33 UTC] boxman222: i recall previous times he actually claimed he would change.. some detractors actually hoped it was true, but again and again he slipped back into his old behavior..
[2017-03-03 22:45:48 UTC] ambervisage: it should be "dont like dont watch", if you dont like something, stop doing it, if you dont like seeing Phil rage, stop watching / listening to him.
[2017-03-03 22:46:10 UTC] bitwjoe: if he wouldn't show how he is affected by them they wouldn't do it
[2017-03-03 22:46:14 UTC] bodiebthewire: its not the rage
[2017-03-03 22:46:20 UTC] ambervisage: not fucking make entire channels based on him, fucks sake
[2017-03-03 22:46:42 UTC] annabac: ikr xD but yeah it happened
[2017-03-03 22:46:48 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Phil, Machinima said you lied about why you got fired from them, and it's because you have bad content and put words in their mouth that they didn't say to cover your image. You should feel bad for being such a pathological liar and milking your fans of their hard earned money you fucking cancer to gaming
[2017-03-03 22:46:49 UTC] boxman222: AmberVisage: it has never been about rage... if anything that is probably what most people like to see him do. What they dont like however is blaming the game or how he snaps at his viewers if he is in bad mood
[2017-03-03 22:46:55 UTC] bitwjoe: pewdiepie has way more haters then he will ever have but they don't affect him because he doesn't show it
[2017-03-03 22:47:04 UTC] annabac: ^
[2017-03-03 22:47:17 UTC] bodiebthewire: how about taking patreon money....for a game then nopt finishing
[2017-03-03 22:47:36 UTC] theycallmejimbob: well he does have millions of fans to counteract it Bitwjoe if you were to see a replay of the stream chat there was as much constructive criticism as negative criticism.
[2017-03-03 22:47:38 UTC] bitwjoe: they know complaining will do nothing where Phil has shown time after time that they are actually causing problems
[2017-03-03 22:47:39 UTC] hotcakes28: it seems like every day Phil begs 4 money Seriously. A Grown Man his age . Why not go back to Connecticut
[2017-03-03 22:47:46 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Phil is a narcissist
[2017-03-03 22:47:47 UTC] krazyberries: I missed the stream is he quitting?
[2017-03-03 22:47:48 UTC] boxman222: perfect example was the last few streams when shit hit the fan.. people including his subs would be banned for the smallest thing even if it was just a honest suggestion
[2017-03-03 22:47:51 UTC] ambervisage: of course it doesnt affect pewdiepie he is literally shitting bars of gold everytime he opens his mouth in a video
[2017-03-03 22:47:54 UTC] annabac: couldnt care less of he completes a game or not
[2017-03-03 22:48:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no he is considering streaming full time krazyberries if he doesn't find a channel partner
[2017-03-03 22:48:12 UTC] jco888: Kappa
[2017-03-03 22:48:20 UTC] boxman222: that is the shit that makes him lose views and turns these people into detractors or so called trolls
[2017-03-03 22:48:20 UTC] krazyberries: Why did machinima drop him?
[2017-03-03 22:48:28 UTC] ambervisage: he couldnt care less if a random ass no no namer "hates" him
[2017-03-03 22:48:31 UTC] johnnyzee_s: and you fucking cultists paying him money to continue to lie
[2017-03-03 22:48:36 UTC] royal_phalanx91: dunno, he says it was a mutual agreement
[2017-03-03 22:48:41 UTC] bitwjoe: and that's what Phil should act like
[2017-03-03 22:48:54 UTC] playcool18: ..
[2017-03-03 22:49:01 UTC] johnnyzee_s: you are the most pathetic people in the world, giving phil money when he should just sell his house he can't afford and move back to CT, you people are fucking stupid and pathetic. He's been lying to you for years
[2017-03-03 22:49:12 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: are u jelly
[2017-03-03 22:49:20 UTC] bodiebthewire: why didnt he make edited videos.....he knew it would help......but he used the excuse ive done it this way since the begining....well that was good in 2011....but its 2017.....people dont want to watch him fail at a boss in bloodborne for 3 hours
[2017-03-03 22:49:21 UTC] zahvone: Lol I love how
[2017-03-03 22:49:33 UTC] johnnyzee_s: HE LITERALLY lied about Machinima, and they fired him
[2017-03-03 22:49:42 UTC] krazyberries: I don't personally don't give phil money, but why do you care so much @Johnnyzee_s
[2017-03-03 22:49:44 UTC] goodguy33: "Don't like it, don't watch it!" "WHY ARE MY VIEWS SO LOW?!"
[2017-03-03 22:49:49 UTC] bitwjoe: jesus johnny...way to act like a dumbass and talk down to people just like Phil
[2017-03-03 22:49:50 UTC] ambervisage: YES, GUYS, ITS ALL A BIG FUCKING CONSPIRACY, Phil has been lying to us all this time and we all have been giving him money, apparently.
[2017-03-03 22:49:59 UTC] zahvone: Dude no one cares if he's lying.
[2017-03-03 22:49:59 UTC] hotcakes28: He should move back to Connecticut
[2017-03-03 22:50:00 UTC] bodiebthewire: he is lying
[2017-03-03 22:50:07 UTC] johnnyzee_s: you are going to continue to support a PATHOLOGICAL liar? you're fucked in the head. I care because I want to expose LIARS who abuse their fans, cause their fans are brainless, but they deserve better treatment
[2017-03-03 22:50:27 UTC] annabac: relax dude did phil rape you or smthng?
[2017-03-03 22:50:35 UTC] bodiebthewire: lol

[2017-03-03 22:50:44 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Does Phil have to rape me before I stand up against a LIAR? Your problem is that you're a narcissist too
[2017-03-03 22:50:52 UTC] annabac: yolo
[2017-03-03 22:51:15 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Yeah, an yolo zika virus gen moron that Phil hates, yet you give him money cause you're brainless

[2017-03-03 22:51:22 UTC] bodiebthewire: plus 1 for johnny....i guess they will walk with him through the gates of hell no matter what he says or does
[2017-03-03 22:51:23 UTC] marcusdoesgaming: hello my fellow detractors
[2017-03-03 22:51:32 UTC] zahvone: I feel like it doesn't matter if he's a liar. Everyone fucking lies, it's the internet lol. I literally watch him because he says funny shit, in my opinion, so.
[2017-03-03 22:51:32 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: phil actually works his ass off pretty hard
[2017-03-03 22:51:45 UTC] ambervisage: Oh boy, here comes the bullshit conspiracy mambo jambo
[2017-03-03 22:51:48 UTC] johnnyzee_s: If your aim is the be fun at parties rather than being right, you're just a fucking 12 year old kid with no sense of logic, just an emotional bitch low hormone coward who can't face the facts
[2017-03-03 22:52:09 UTC] zahvone: I didn't realize parties were meant to be "right". at.
[2017-03-03 22:52:13 UTC] bodiebthewire: listen to John Rambo....then ask if phil deserved your money
[2017-03-03 22:52:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: have a snickers Johnny you're not you when you're hungry
[2017-03-03 22:52:27 UTC] annabac: i dont agree with phil all the time, i think he entertained me for a long while
[2017-03-03 22:52:27 UTC] hotcakes28: Phil needs a job and his girl to.
[2017-03-03 22:52:52 UTC] darksydegeoff: man people are very concerned about some internet guy's life they will never meet over their own life
[2017-03-03 22:52:53 UTC] johnnyzee_s: And he's lied to you and has been a racist and a bigot countless times, but as long as it entertains you right? Fucking narcissist

[2017-03-03 22:53:25 UTC] bitwjoe: Johnny I don't like Phil but acting like you are better then people is not going to change anything
[2017-03-03 22:53:27 UTC] johnnyzee_s: lmao Geoff, you fucking sellout bitch hahahaha
[2017-03-03 22:53:42 UTC] ambervisage: i will fucking dedicate my entire internet time making a nickname based on another's guy shit and then i will make videos / livestreams / vlogs based on that
[2017-03-03 22:53:44 UTC] annabac: Johnnyzee_s is crying a river dude people like you should move on with your life, watch something YOU enjoy
[2017-03-03 22:54:11 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Acting better than a liar isn't hard at all, a person who lies to his fans about Machinima, and gets fired and spins it. He got fired for being anti-semitic from Blip, has he ever apologized? NO, he's LIED about it
[2017-03-03 22:54:21 UTC] bodiebthewire: once again u go back to the tihydp
[2017-03-03 22:54:23 UTC] bitwjoe: He already is paying for his mistakes just sit back and watch the trainwreck johnny

[2017-03-03 22:54:26 UTC] ambervisage: AND PHIL IS THE IDIOT AND THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT, OK!
[2017-03-03 22:55:09 UTC] annabac: i can see
[2017-03-03 22:55:11 UTC] ambervisage: Wait, didnt Phil just apologize on this stream and say how big of a fucking idiot he was about the Blip incident? lmao
[2017-03-03 22:55:11 UTC] bodiebthewire: cant you be a realist and say ya maybe they waste there lives goin after him but ....what do they say that is wrong or a lie
[2017-03-03 22:55:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yup AmberVisage
[2017-03-03 22:55:27 UTC] johnnyzee_s: No, he said he had apologized before, and denyed being antisemitic
[2017-03-03 22:55:41 UTC] ambervisage: THE FUCK ARE U ON ABOUT?
[2017-03-03 22:55:48 UTC] hotcakes28: phil should do a Giveaway . We deserve it after all his pitty partys

[2017-03-03 22:56:07 UTC] darksydegeoff: while you reveal how miserable and pathetic you are
[2017-03-03 22:56:07 UTC] johnnyzee_s: He never acknoweldged that his words were antisemetic, and he never said sorry for what he said. Geoff, look at your life. Built on the coattails of cancer, you should be proud
[2017-03-03 22:56:23 UTC] darksydegeoff: how about a job
[2017-03-03 22:56:24 UTC] darksydegeoff: an education
[2017-03-03 22:56:26 UTC] boxman222: AmberVisage: he should have gone further I think.. If you admit you have been acting like a asshole, then you should also maybe apologize to the people who turned into a detractor as a result
[2017-03-03 22:56:27 UTC] darksydegeoff: a girlfriend
[2017-03-03 22:56:28 UTC] zahvone: I just don't understand it. You're so passionate about "exposing a liar" but you're so quick to act like a degenerate to other people with different opinions lol
[2017-03-03 22:56:39 UTC] johnnyzee_s: you're just another scrub with a microphone, and 09er piece of shit who can't play 3s or cvs2 or Mvc2 to save his life. you're a fucking idiot. Yeah I have a job/gf/education too
[2017-03-03 22:56:40 UTC] ambervisage: So "I dont know what i was thinking and i should have never done it" doesnt translate to being sorry and aknowledging your mistake?
[2017-03-03 22:56:42 UTC] minticorn: And look at you, orbiting this dude to defend him against the 'pathetic' naysayers
[2017-03-03 22:56:56 UTC] darksydegeoff: ahahahah yeah i'm sure because you spend all your free time doing this
[2017-03-03 22:56:58 UTC] boxman222: and i am not talking about the trolls that did not watch his streams/videos before.. there are two kinds of detractors
[2017-03-03 22:57:00 UTC] darksydegeoff: you fucking loser

[2017-03-03 22:57:06 UTC] goodguy33: Daaaaaaaaaaamn
[2017-03-03 22:57:09 UTC] bodiebthewire: i actually feel bad for dsp.....he needs real help....like a life intervention....hes screwin his credit up just to try to be a YT....why not get a real job and just stream on twitc when you can
[2017-03-03 22:57:12 UTC] johnnyzee_s: and I can swing clubs the size of your torso like nothing, you're just a fucking low hormone bitch who sucked DSP's cock to YT fame hahahahahaha
[2017-03-03 22:57:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: wow Johnnyzee_s jumped the shark
[2017-03-03 22:57:28 UTC] darksydegeoff: damn look he can't defend himself so he's throwing random insults

[2017-03-03 22:57:46 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Random? Not random at all, moron. It was very on point. You rid his coattails to fame, and you're nothing
[2017-03-03 22:57:53 UTC] bodiebthewire: look at this dude thinkin he makin good point lmao
[2017-03-03 22:57:59 UTC] boxman222: DarksydeGeoff: you are falling into the same trap as phil

[2017-03-03 22:58:12 UTC] zahvone: lol
[2017-03-03 22:58:18 UTC] darksydegeoff: a career apparently means nothing to this loser
[2017-03-03 22:58:18 UTC] johnnyzee_s: you're an 09er scrub with a microphone and a dick to suck, you spent your whole life making YT videos, clearly it means something to you. Are you backpedling on your life? fucking hypocrite lmao
[2017-03-03 22:58:45 UTC] bodiebthewire: this isnt a career
[2017-03-03 22:58:46 UTC] darksydegeoff: when you inevitably cut your wrists tonight be sure to whisper my name

[2017-03-03 22:59:17 UTC] darksydegeoff: he thinks fighting game performance matters
[2017-03-03 22:59:22 UTC] darksydegeoff: even though i bodied the shit out of him

[2017-03-03 23:00:54 UTC] marcusdoesgaming: having fun being a rip off of him lol
[2017-03-03 23:00:55 UTC] boxman222: AmberVisage: this is the perfect example of the trolling kind of a detractor :P you should just ignore it
[2017-03-03 23:00:59 UTC] jbrojo91: How is johnny still here yet other people banned
[2017-03-03 23:01:10 UTC] bammbino: i dont live by phil's words, but seeing his haters type shows how stupid they really are
[2017-03-03 23:01:10 UTC] johnnyzee_s: I criticized you too, bitch, that's why you got scared and left, the truth about your life was too harsh, I feel sorry for you bitch boy
[2017-03-03 23:01:33 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Look everyone we've got a badass over here
[2017-03-03 23:01:48 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Nah, just a sane person in the midst of cultists of cancer
[2017-03-03 23:01:57 UTC] ambervisage: a random ass asswipe critisized someone and he instantly left in shame cause he was scared? never heard of that again
[2017-03-03 23:02:04 UTC] annabac: yeah repeat it and repeat it
[2017-03-03 23:02:11 UTC] annabac: who;s the crazy one
[2017-03-03 23:02:13 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: how old are u johnny
[2017-03-03 23:02:13 UTC] dragonjarvis: what happend ? I just came into the stream to see if phil does switch unboxing or something and all I read are insults xD wtf
[2017-03-03 23:02:37 UTC] bammbino: @DragonJarvis, hes doing it tonight, we gotta wait for it to be delivered
[2017-03-03 23:02:38 UTC] jbrojo91: You guys are feeding the troll
[2017-03-03 23:02:42 UTC] ambervisage: johnny simmer down tiger, we know you are amazing and talented and have a great career and you are a better SF player (?!?!?)
[2017-03-03 23:02:52 UTC] johnnyzee_s: Phil lied about Machinima's words on the YT situation, so they fired him and said he has bad content, so now he's lying to get more money from fans and i'm exposing him to his cult's shagrin
[2017-03-03 23:02:53 UTC] boxman222: DragonJarvis: i guess you missed his 2 hours stream about him being screwed and without partnership then?
[2017-03-03 23:03:00 UTC] bammbino: @DragonJarvis, hes fucked on shipping like me, i have to wait til near 8pm for my shit to arrive
[2017-03-03 23:03:04 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Yeah Johnny you're the epitome of a sane person alright.
[2017-03-03 23:03:28 UTC] bodiebthewire: ou guyls low key LOVE Phil dont you....like nothing he can do is wrong....do you have integrity
[2017-03-03 23:03:34 UTC] dragonjarvis: @Bammbino ah okay thanks. @Boxmann222 I was busy playing zelda botw
[2017-03-03 23:03:39 UTC] truth_commision: if anybody is in a cult its detractors
[2017-03-03 23:03:54 UTC] ambervisage: WHAT MONEY YOU FUCKING IDIOT HE CAME HERE TO PRESENT THE SITUATION AND ASK FOR SUGGESTIONS
[2017-03-03 23:03:55 UTC] bammbino: @DragonJarvis, hows the graphics in person? YT doesnt cut it for quality
[2017-03-03 23:04:18 UTC] bodiebthewire: act like he hasnt made 30 vis beggin for money in the last 6 months
[2017-03-03 23:04:20 UTC] jbrojo91: Both sides of the argument are wrong
[2017-03-03 23:04:47 UTC] ambervisage: ALSO IT SHOULD BE NOTED: "IF YOU LIKE ANY OF MY CONTENT AND WANT TO SEE ME KEEP GOING", those were his words, THAT DOES NOT apply to you, so fucking relax with the whole money asking bullshit
[2017-03-03 23:04:54 UTC] dragonjarvis: @Bammbino I play the WiiU version but the graphics are fine. This game looks pretty! Only thing is when it gets to busy in game the framerate drops sometimes but that is not really often
[2017-03-03 23:05:09 UTC] jbrojo91: The detractors go way too far and the supporters are making it seem like everything he does is okay
[2017-03-03 23:05:30 UTC] boxman222: again they are not a hive mind
[2017-03-03 23:05:38 UTC] bammbino: @jbrojo91, you're wrong.. those of us that support phil are not okay with everything he does
[2017-03-03 23:05:41 UTC] bodiebthewire: listen if phil would actually do the things that could really help him he might stabilize the ship....but unedited lets plays are not puttin in the work...thats the path of least resistance
[2017-03-03 23:05:59 UTC] ambervisage: No fuck no i dont support everything he does / ever done
[2017-03-03 23:06:10 UTC] mattty38: why would you care if you dont like it
[2017-03-03 23:06:12 UTC] bammbino: @jbrojo91, i very much dislike phil's rage and complaining about game devs.. i LOVE fun and funny phil and that is what keeps me tuning in
[2017-03-03 23:06:14 UTC] bodiebthewire: you seem 8 inches up his ass tho
[2017-03-03 23:06:20 UTC] boxman222: and again you also forget that many of these detractors actually used to be his fan and some were so loyal that they subbed to him
[2017-03-03 23:06:25 UTC] jbrojo91: and by that logic all the detractors all hate Phil and want him to fail?
[2017-03-03 23:06:30 UTC] ambervisage: remember that one time he was selling fucking empty cases of old games?
[2017-03-03 23:06:36 UTC] lightweightbro: what a sad fucking day dude
[2017-03-03 23:06:44 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yeah there are extremes on both side I guess
[2017-03-03 23:06:48 UTC] bodiebthewire: lmao ya the empty games
[2017-03-03 23:07:15 UTC] ollyorange: swhens phil back
[2017-03-03 23:07:16 UTC] ambervisage: that was fucking outrageous and disgusting, also slowmode is fucking annoying like hell
[2017-03-03 23:07:30 UTC] boxman222: yeah that was fucked up.. dont think he sold them though
[2017-03-03 23:07:37 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: there's also upcoming reveals about machinima breakup
[2017-03-03 23:07:58 UTC] annabac: imo he puts out to much contect, pre stream, weak in preview, and his money situation, but im still enjoying his other stuff, i just don't watch the rest and i won't be annoyed with it
[2017-03-03 23:08:00 UTC] truth_commision: reveals by who?
[2017-03-03 23:08:05 UTC] annabac: n*
[2017-03-03 23:08:09 UTC] bammbino: face it... haters and supporters wanted phil to leave MCN years ago.. they are a fucked up company
[2017-03-03 23:08:10 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: by dsp?
[2017-03-03 23:08:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Surprised he doesn't have a non-disclosure agreement with them
[2017-03-03 23:08:16 UTC] bodiebthewire: listen i dont hate phil.....i just wish he would stop thinkin all constructive criticisms are trolls who dont deserve to speak
[2017-03-03 23:08:22 UTC] ollyorange: iwhen phil streaming tonight?
[2017-03-03 23:08:29 UTC] shindigpsc: I think its important to note this situation is of Phil's own making. As vitriolic as some detractors seem, their influence has not been as damaging as some would like you to believe.
[2017-03-03 23:08:42 UTC] bammbino: @ollyorange, he has to wait on the switch to be delivered
[2017-03-03 23:08:49 UTC] jbrojo91: I don't get why that one guy was banned when people like johnny were not...
[2017-03-03 23:08:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bodiebthewire, well that's a fair point I have seen people with legit constructive criticism get banned.
[2017-03-03 23:09:04 UTC] shindigpsc: By the same token, I don't begrudge his fans backing him.
[2017-03-03 23:09:17 UTC] bammbino: @jbrojo91, was nightbot... mods are asleep right now since majority of them are EU
[2017-03-03 23:09:20 UTC] ollyorange: i dont want phil to dissappear of the internet
[2017-03-03 23:09:25 UTC] dragonjarvis: my retailer (I live in germany) sold the Switch one day early though, haha they do that all the time
[2017-03-03 23:09:36 UTC] bodiebthewire: he could have used the tihydp a long time ago and back then he might have brought them in b 4 they made a career out of hating on him......and got way more views....some of those vids get 125 k views
[2017-03-03 23:09:38 UTC] ambervisage: have they? honestly i havent seen anyone get banned for something truly constructive
[2017-03-03 23:09:52 UTC] shindigpsc: @ollyorange, nothing disappears from the internet.
[2017-03-03 23:10:01 UTC] jbrojo91: bitwjoe begs to differ
[2017-03-03 23:10:08 UTC] annabac: i agree ShindigPSC its all on him, youtube changed a lot, everything is faster and edited
[2017-03-03 23:10:09 UTC] ollyorange: i mean i dont want him stop making content
[2017-03-03 23:10:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Ah some of the bans I've seen have been pretty harsh AmberVisage not all of them mind you
[2017-03-03 23:10:15 UTC] bodiebthewire: when you talk about bloodborne....or quiting streams he had as patreon goals
[2017-03-03 23:10:18 UTC] truth_commision: People who get banned by dsp largely have deserved it
[2017-03-03 23:10:27 UTC] annabac: that meaning, his persona should change
[2017-03-03 23:10:29 UTC] kingjadvcmp: nah nobody ever gets unbanned fairly :P
[2017-03-03 23:10:37 UTC] jbrojo91: what did he say to cause his ban?
[2017-03-03 23:10:46 UTC] bodiebthewire: maybe some do...but i saw him ban someone who said he shouldnt have quit persona 3
[2017-03-03 23:10:50 UTC] ambervisage: well i wont stick a needle in my eye about it
[2017-03-03 23:10:56 UTC] boxman222: i have seent that many times.... whenever phil is in bad mood he can take pretty much anything as trolling and is very quick on the banhammer
[2017-03-03 23:11:23 UTC] ambervisage: but i doubt those bans were by Phil himself
[2017-03-03 23:11:28 UTC] bammbino: @boxman222, well that happens to everyone that has a community around them
[2017-03-03 23:11:29 UTC] shindigpsc: Phil is terrible at taking criticism or feedback.
[2017-03-03 23:11:45 UTC] kingjadvcmp: to be fair to Phil he kinda admitted that tonight
[2017-03-03 23:11:50 UTC] bodiebthewire: well the white knights dont help
[2017-03-03 23:11:53 UTC] boxman222: AmberVisage: the ones i am talking about was phil himself
[2017-03-03 23:11:56 UTC] jbrojo91: He admitted nothing
[2017-03-03 23:12:00 UTC] annabac: he is and admits it's when it's to late
[2017-03-03 23:12:06 UTC] ollyorange: phil sticks to his guns i respect that
[2017-03-03 23:12:11 UTC] annabac: every new year jan feb something happenes
[2017-03-03 23:12:26 UTC] ambervisage: @boxman222, Im strickly talking about this stream, i dont know about any other bans.
[2017-03-03 23:12:33 UTC] bammbino: @boxman222, a FF14 YTber/streamer lashed out a few years ago and didnt really mean to.. he made a video saying sorry and gave his plan of action on how he will avoid things like that
[2017-03-03 23:12:38 UTC] boxman222: i see.. did not see him ban anyone today
[2017-03-03 23:12:43 UTC] bodiebthewire: liesten the one thing where he tryuly got fucked was the false copyright strikes.....and being swattted
[2017-03-03 23:12:57 UTC] bammbino: @boxman222, phil has tried to make SOME changes in his behaviour but all the bad luck brings him back down
[2017-03-03 23:13:02 UTC] kingjadvcmp: the detractors, for the most part, were not happy about the swatting incident. Still don't know WHO did it
[2017-03-03 23:13:10 UTC] royal_phalanx91: to be honest if he listened to feedback more he wouldn't be in this dire situation
[2017-03-03 23:13:13 UTC] jbrojo91: It's not bad luck he creates those problems
[2017-03-03 23:13:18 UTC] ambervisage: yes im sure the detractors were not happy about it
[2017-03-03 23:13:23 UTC] bammbino: im w/ you Royal_Phalanx91
[2017-03-03 23:13:52 UTC] pearl_anythingfps: any cancer in here yet?
[2017-03-03 23:14:04 UTC] shindigpsc: @bambbino, I disagree. The last week has been a proper meltdown. He has never been able to show restraint. Even in edited or pre-recorded content.
[2017-03-03 23:14:06 UTC] bodiebthewire: listen im not a " detractor" but the metal gear solid tihydp is hillarious
[2017-03-03 23:14:14 UTC] jbrojo91: if he ignores the trolls he would be okay, I don't think listening to people with no experience with success on YouTube or twitch would have saved him
[2017-03-03 23:14:28 UTC] boxman222: i am sure some were really happy about it, but certainly not the majority.
[2017-03-03 23:14:34 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: must have done the swatting not realizing that it's actually dangerous
[2017-03-03 23:14:38 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I just wonder what Leanna's take on this situation is. Keep in mind here, all things considered, she's still a very young woman who's suddenly the main earner in the household
[2017-03-03 23:14:39 UTC] bodiebthewire: i dont have an m9
[2017-03-03 23:14:53 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Why do the detractors make youtube accounts dedicated to trolling him and making 3 HOUR LONG podcasts? Can't you just ignore him and don't give a fuck about what he does?
[2017-03-03 23:15:08 UTC] bammbino: @ShindigPSC, phil wasnt all that bad in '15 and '16..
[2017-03-03 23:15:10 UTC] bogwaterman111: He's funny to talk about
[2017-03-03 23:15:11 UTC] annabac: they like him and want him to change
[2017-03-03 23:15:13 UTC] ambervisage: anyone that is "swatting" people, deserves a special kind of place in the everlasting flames of hell
[2017-03-03 23:15:18 UTC] jbrojo91: Because he brings attention to it phalanx
[2017-03-03 23:15:24 UTC] dragonjarvis: people already do hatepodcasts of phil over at hitbox.tv lol
[2017-03-03 23:15:24 UTC] nightbot: DragonJarvis -> Looks like the crap has hit the fan. [stop posting links] [warning]
[2017-03-03 23:15:27 UTC] boxman222: Royal_Phalanx91: it is entertaining.. simple as that
[2017-03-03 23:15:31 UTC] kingjadvcmp: it's fun to analyse Phil from a psychological point of view, for sure
[2017-03-03 23:15:44 UTC] ambervisage: EXACTLY, READ WHAT DRAGON SAID
[2017-03-03 23:15:48 UTC] bodiebthewire: podcasts are one thing but the tihydp.....are great....he should have used it to his advantage wen he could....he took way to long
[2017-03-03 23:15:52 UTC] jbrojo91: thats why they do it and that's why they continue to do it, he notices them
[2017-03-03 23:16:17 UTC] dragonjarvis: there are already hateful podcasts over at hitbox about phil lol
[2017-03-03 23:16:17 UTC] ambervisage: Like, what the fuck?
[2017-03-03 23:16:19 UTC] bodiebthewire: laughing at him at certain times doesnt mean you hate him
[2017-03-03 23:16:21 UTC] royal_phalanx91: having said that i did enjoy watching some tihydp's
[2017-03-03 23:16:26 UTC] encelor: holy shit ppl still in chat been gone outside for hour and half chat still active :D
[2017-03-03 23:16:34 UTC] annabac: xD
[2017-03-03 23:16:36 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey encelor o/
[2017-03-03 23:16:54 UTC] bammbino: @encelor, when he was live, chat was cancer.. its cooled down now
[2017-03-03 23:16:58 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: and they wouldn't exist if he only listened to everything, so he himself gave birth to sok
[2017-03-03 23:17:03 UTC] ambervisage: "Laughing at him at certain times" translates into making super lengthy and "elaborate" livestreams of some random ass people talking about him, right?
[2017-03-03 23:17:04 UTC] bammbino: even his own mod, gino was a fucking nightmare
[2017-03-03 23:17:05 UTC] bodiebthewire: i also think the stream chat hurts his content
[2017-03-03 23:17:07 UTC] encelor: hey theycallmejimbob how are you man
[2017-03-03 23:17:26 UTC] kingjadvcmp: stream chat definitely hurts his playthroughs
[2017-03-03 23:17:39 UTC] royal_phalanx91: does it? he doesn't pay attention to it most of the time
[2017-03-03 23:17:39 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: d00ds
[2017-03-03 23:17:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: good thanks encelor and yourself
[2017-03-03 23:17:45 UTC] bodiebthewire: he does
[2017-03-03 23:17:56 UTC] encelor: good thanks :)
[2017-03-03 23:17:59 UTC] bammbino: @KingjadVCMP, thats the issue that people dont see.. alot say "it hurts his playthroughs" but they dont watch them
[2017-03-03 23:18:06 UTC] dragonjarvis: this is what I dont get, ppl complain about streamchat AND they complain that phil does not react to the streamchat?! this blows my mind.
[2017-03-03 23:18:14 UTC] boxman222: Royal_Phalanx91: he sadly does sometimes when he needs help, which actually leads to less rage
[2017-03-03 23:18:18 UTC] kingjadvcmp: gonna call bullshit right there, he pays plenty attention to it, especially when he's stuck on something and not willing to take 5-10 minutes to think of a solution himself
[2017-03-03 23:18:35 UTC] encelor: why is chat in timer mode<
[2017-03-03 23:18:42 UTC] jbrojo91: i think the supporters are going to stick by him no matter what at this point, we've had people admit that they don't agree with a lot of the things he does and still watch so I don't think it matters. He can claim all he wants that it is the detractors, YouTube, or whatever else but really everything Phil is going through is his fault.
[2017-03-03 23:18:47 UTC] shindigpsc: Yup, Phil's playthroughs became a conveyor belt.
[2017-03-03 23:18:47 UTC] bammbino: so?? phil doesnt want to be stuck.. go find another streamer that likes challenge
[2017-03-03 23:18:47 UTC] ambervisage: cause whoever enabled it left it open
[2017-03-03 23:18:54 UTC] bodiebthewire: if his face cam is on u can see him reading it every time hes stuck on even the smallest of puzzles
[2017-03-03 23:19:03 UTC] royal_phalanx91: @KingjadVCMP the lack of editing hurts his playthroughs most of all, nobody wants to sit through videos filled with boring crap. I've said as much on the forums
[2017-03-03 23:19:10 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Yeah I agree KingJad the amount of times I seen people give Phil instant solutions to any sign of a challenge he got is astounding. I wish people would wait for him to ask for help before providing a solution. I know many other streams would ban you for spoiling.
[2017-03-03 23:19:15 UTC] bammbino: phil used a spear for nioh and NEVER changed stances on purpose.. how dare you think he wants challenge
[2017-03-03 23:19:23 UTC] annabac: the thing is as a streamer you want it to be entertaining so being stuck like his jump crouch thing
[2017-03-03 23:19:34 UTC] boxman222: i recall during his early youtube exclusive days.. he would rage and get stuck and eventually somehow beat the stage/game in a way that it was not supposed to be done.. that actually was entertaining to me
[2017-03-03 23:19:42 UTC] encelor: just because phil makes mistakes does not mean we should also hate his content xD
[2017-03-03 23:19:44 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Tbh I never noticed that except for dark souls
[2017-03-03 23:20:01 UTC] kingjadvcmp: even back then he'd just load up GAMEFAQS, or a guide Revan made him lol
[2017-03-03 23:20:01 UTC] jbrojo91: Who said to hate his content?
[2017-03-03 23:20:04 UTC] boxman222: he kept repeating the same mistakes over an d over to the point where the game ltierally gave up and let him progress ;P
[2017-03-03 23:20:04 UTC] bodiebthewire: thats becuse thats the only times he has it on
[2017-03-03 23:20:08 UTC] shindigpsc: His commentary was better, too. Now he does bosses in silence and, aside from the intros, there's a lack of personality.
[2017-03-03 23:20:25 UTC] ambervisage: yeah sadly the vast majority of people cater to short montages filled with scripted shit and overreactions
[2017-03-03 23:20:28 UTC] annabac: he drank in the old day
[2017-03-03 23:20:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: It was funny seeing him stop in the middle of one of the videos for Banjo and look up a guide :D
[2017-03-03 23:20:36 UTC] boxman222: this does not happen anymore now that twitch chat helps him out
[2017-03-03 23:21:02 UTC] bammbino: @ShindigPSC, as we get older, we lose the abililty to talk during an intense moment.. phil does focus hard on boss fights, i just wonder how he doesnt see shit in fights that we easily see when we play games
[2017-03-03 23:21:08 UTC] royal_phalanx91: His commentary was better back in the day, now it's a lot of 'hmm', 'aha'
[2017-03-03 23:21:16 UTC] bodiebthewire: or how he was level 96 in bloodborne befor gettin to the 3rd boss
[2017-03-03 23:21:20 UTC] encelor: so did phil have a final desicion on what he gonna do i missed a chunk of the stream
[2017-03-03 23:21:28 UTC] jbrojo91: amber are you Phil? You just regurgitated his speech perfectly
[2017-03-03 23:21:33 UTC] ambervisage: To be completely fair after dieing to a boss so many times u just want to shut up and focus on it
[2017-03-03 23:21:37 UTC] annabac: true that Royal_Phalanx91
[2017-03-03 23:21:38 UTC] kingjadvcmp: basically Phil needs a new MCN partner - if you know any, let him know, hint hint
[2017-03-03 23:21:54 UTC] theycallmejimbob: not really encelor he said he'd consider becoming a full time twitch streamer if he can't get a partnership
[2017-03-03 23:22:16 UTC] encelor: so phil really got fired from machinima since he don't expand contract?
[2017-03-03 23:22:20 UTC] ambervisage: @jbrojo91, Yes i am Phil, congratufuckinlations.
[2017-03-03 23:22:26 UTC] bodiebthewire: what about the group that he negotiated withb 4 machinima
[2017-03-03 23:22:29 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil's priority right now is that MCN partnership due to his large volume of videos that are liable to be copyright-claimed due to not being partnered no longer.
[2017-03-03 23:22:38 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he said it was a mutual agreement encelor to part ways after that I dunno
[2017-03-03 23:22:45 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Nobody knows if he got fired or not for certain, Phil said it was a mutual departure, though this strongly implies that he got fired
[2017-03-03 23:22:53 UTC] dragonjarvis: he could partner with brazzers lol
[2017-03-03 23:23:09 UTC] shindigpsc: @bammbino, I just think this crossed over from being a hobby to being work for Phil. He's committed himself into a corner.
[2017-03-03 23:23:09 UTC] bammbino: @KingjadVCMP, yeah all those nintendo videos lol... Square enix actually owns his ff13 channel now lol
[2017-03-03 23:23:16 UTC] bodiebthewire: his twitter said the worst news ever....so that to me makes it seem like he was fired
[2017-03-03 23:23:24 UTC] encelor: well phil can private the videos
[2017-03-03 23:23:25 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil said last night he'd quit, he changed his tune a wee bit today for some reason - personally I think it was mainly him being fired, his tweets were so erratic last night
[2017-03-03 23:23:25 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: hey jimbob
[2017-03-03 23:23:32 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey thekingofcrybabyshd
[2017-03-03 23:23:44 UTC] ambervisage: thing is why was he fired? it was like a week ago that machinima was digging up shit for him
[2017-03-03 23:23:47 UTC] boxman222: i think his tweet yesterday makes it clear it came as a surprise and that they let him go.. he just ended a stream and just moment before announced that he would be playing yakuza later in evening and then suddenly out of nowhere he said he quit machinima
[2017-03-03 23:24:00 UTC] encelor: well phil's channel is on decline
[2017-03-03 23:24:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bodiebthewire, he said he also had a new partnership that would be sorted over dinner.
[2017-03-03 23:24:12 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well he said he was gonna demand answers and not take shit, maybe he said something they didn't like? Or maybe it was Machinima's fault for his ad revenue, since it was not a YouTube issue?
[2017-03-03 23:24:20 UTC] bammbino: @ShindigPSC, im with you there too.. yes steamers and youbuers translate this into a JOB.. but phil is a special kind of entertainer.. and when he started saying this isa business all the time, he started to complain about alot of small things in games
[2017-03-03 23:24:28 UTC] bodiebthewire: screen wave right?
[2017-03-03 23:24:36 UTC] boxman222: yeah i wonder what happened to that other network he talked to
[2017-03-03 23:24:42 UTC] royal_phalanx91: It was clear that the information was recieved very suddenly by phil, and yeah Phil's been on the decline since 2014 at the latest. back then he had a huge forum and it was popular
[2017-03-03 23:24:45 UTC] kingjadvcmp: no response yet AFAIK
[2017-03-03 23:24:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yup bodiebthewire and that hit a roadblock
[2017-03-03 23:24:55 UTC] dragonjarvis: RTU made a good video about phil you should watch it
[2017-03-03 23:25:37 UTC] bodiebthewire: hes goin to have to take a hit one way or another...his best bet is to just accept what he can get for now
[2017-03-03 23:25:41 UTC] bammbino: thats part of the problem DragonJarvis.. i feel that phil has gone off based on what others do over listening to us fans
[2017-03-03 23:25:42 UTC] encelor: machinima might have denied phil's contract aplication due to phil losing his youtube ad thing because machinima didn't make enough money?
[2017-03-03 23:25:59 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Moving to Seattle was probably the biggest mistake he has ever made in his entire life, second to the John Rambo and forum fiasco
[2017-03-03 23:26:17 UTC] ambervisage: wait why was the "john rambo" mistake so big?
[2017-03-03 23:26:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Wow what a difference a week makes considering he was praising Machinima in a recent vlog
[2017-03-03 23:26:34 UTC] bodiebthewire: well he was callin out machinima sayin they werent givin him news quick enough and he read personal business correspondence
[2017-03-03 23:26:40 UTC] bammbino: no way man.. did you not hear old phil?? yes he had better commentary but the dude sounded like he was dying
[2017-03-03 23:26:40 UTC] dragonjarvis: @Dammbino, no I think it is not. Did you watch the video? I agree with RTU 100% phil should stop always talking about business. I am here to relax and enjoy and not listen to phils worries too.
[2017-03-03 23:26:44 UTC] faisalking11: is he streaming soon guys?
[2017-03-03 23:26:44 UTC] boxman222: encelor: makes no sense since it was them who told him to to get around the problem by making videos shorter
[2017-03-03 23:27:12 UTC] royal_phalanx91: John Rambo once made a tell all video explaining why he was cutting ties with Phil, though he still wished him all the best, basically he was (alleged) to have been treating his friends poorly
[2017-03-03 23:27:13 UTC] bammbino: @DragonJarvis, not the recent ones, but i am saying in general like today he said he talks about bits cause "others do it"
[2017-03-03 23:27:15 UTC] boxman222: you dont fire someone a day after telling them how to "fix it"
[2017-03-03 23:27:18 UTC] annabac: check jrambos vid AmberVisage
[2017-03-03 23:27:32 UTC] bodiebthewire: yes the rambo thing was shady
[2017-03-03 23:27:33 UTC] kingjadvcmp: no shekels for poor Howard :(
[2017-03-03 23:27:38 UTC] bammbino: @DragonJarvis, it should be " i did this change cause my fans suggested it"
[2017-03-03 23:27:47 UTC] ambervisage: and why was that valid proof that "Phil" has been treating friends poorly?
[2017-03-03 23:28:04 UTC] bodiebthewire: he lied to there faces
[2017-03-03 23:28:07 UTC] boxman222: if you want to know then just watch it..
[2017-03-03 23:28:09 UTC] kingjadvcmp: cos of who they were? lol who'd know him better than them, besides his parents and Leanna?
[2017-03-03 23:28:10 UTC] shindigpsc: Yeah, he's disclosed something which violated his TOS.
[2017-03-03 23:28:11 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Because Phil was such good friends with them, and Phil dicked them over
[2017-03-03 23:28:18 UTC] dragonjarvis: @Bammbino but but isnt that exactly what fans want? All the time you read "stop crying" or, "edit your content" because that is exactly what others do AND what fans want and suggest to him
[2017-03-03 23:28:20 UTC] ambervisage: i strongly believe the "there is no fire without smoke" kind of saying
[2017-03-03 23:28:30 UTC] annabac: there was a clip with leanna talking about rambo getting no money or something also
[2017-03-03 23:28:49 UTC] faisalking11: yep there is annabac
[2017-03-03 23:28:59 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I strongly believe you are incapable of believing anything that portrays Phil even slightly negatively, AmberVisage - but that's just me.
[2017-03-03 23:29:03 UTC] bodiebthewire: hr also put personel texts on his vlog
[2017-03-03 23:29:03 UTC] bammbino: @DragonJarvis, what fan wants edited content from him? look at the reactio on kogaming.. people shit all over the editing style or if phil's not good enough
[2017-03-03 23:29:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I'm not sure how being a full time twitch streamer would work out for him. Wouldn't he need like 60-80 subs a day to make it work. Considering January was a bad month for him with YT, twitch and patreon can't see how putting focus into twitch would work out in the long run.
[2017-03-03 23:29:24 UTC] faisalking11: he s fucked
[2017-03-03 23:29:41 UTC] dragonjarvis: @Bammbino yeah but on the other hand every video there gets way more views then his playthroughs. so something there has to be right
[2017-03-03 23:29:46 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I think I believe John Rambo, tbh. Phil made a BIG mistake not doing something to try and straighten things out and talk
[2017-03-03 23:29:56 UTC] annabac: you have to build it ofcourse nobody starts at the end theycallmejimbob but its a very high goal indeed
[2017-03-03 23:29:59 UTC] shindigpsc: Twitch plays more into his 'raw gameplay' gimmick.
[2017-03-03 23:30:13 UTC] bammbino: i dont like the "edit gameplay on your reviews" its been a distraction for him where as his old review style was straight up phil talking about the good, the bad, and the ugly
[2017-03-03 23:30:22 UTC] royal_phalanx91: And he should have been a much better friend to them
[2017-03-03 23:30:26 UTC] ambervisage: @KingjadVCMP, I cant believe something that has just been said by someone, like there are SO MANY variables in it, and without knowing the story from both sides, i aint believing shit.
[2017-03-03 23:30:28 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Howard and John got a lot of questions from others asking about Phil and stuff before they made the video, the point of it was to address those questions, in one video only, and not have to answer any more of those questions.
[2017-03-03 23:30:34 UTC] dragonjarvis: @Bammbino also ppl here in chat said 10 miniutes ago "uneditent content is hurting phil" so ppl want it
[2017-03-03 23:31:01 UTC] bodiebthewire: he should edit all his gameplay vids....thats why people dont watch 100 % of the vids......because a lot of it is manotenous
[2017-03-03 23:31:17 UTC] dragonjarvis: or rather phils business
[2017-03-03 23:31:34 UTC] boxman222: when people say edit videos they do not mean edit out all the fails.. just the boring stuff like backtracking
[2017-03-03 23:31:36 UTC] annabac: right, low energy or just the same commentary
[2017-03-03 23:31:40 UTC] kingjadvcmp: honestly, if Phil gets lost for 10 minutes in a video, and that's the part that's uploaded to YouTube, are you gonna enjoy him being lost walking in circles, making no progress, going 'ummmmm' and 'ehhhhhh'?
[2017-03-03 23:31:42 UTC] bodiebthewire: exactly
[2017-03-03 23:32:19 UTC] royal_phalanx91: @KingjacVCMP Yeah, that's boring shit he could easily cut out, I admit I've largely stopped watching Phil's videos because of it
[2017-03-03 23:32:22 UTC] bammbino: @DragonJarvis, Nioh review - 5,089 views on a channel that doesnt make big bucks(phil admit it today) vs his playthroughts have an average of 2k or a bit less view per vid when you total up the video # and divide the views in total
[2017-03-03 23:32:30 UTC] shindigpsc: Yeah, when I edit videos, I ditch moments of getting lost or backtracking. Phil could still do that with his 4 hour a day schedule.
[2017-03-03 23:32:33 UTC] teh_smarty: so
[2017-03-03 23:32:59 UTC] annabac: or hire someone
[2017-03-03 23:33:03 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Yeah Annabac good point but he has like 125 subs at the moment after 3 months. It would kinda be a final roll of the dice streaming for twice as long as he does now every day. It would be some achievement to reach that goal.
[2017-03-03 23:33:07 UTC] teh_smarty: how did the talk go
[2017-03-03 23:33:14 UTC] bodiebthewire: if he doesnt like doin it he could pay someone to do it....and i trly beliebe it would make him more money so he would be able to afford it
[2017-03-03 23:33:18 UTC] dragonjarvis: I think the problem is that he does not know what to do AND the fanbase in general does not know what they want. it is like 50% say do this and the other 50% say that, so either way phils is gonna piss off alot of people @Bammbino and the review still got 4000 more views then his playthrough videos.
[2017-03-03 23:33:21 UTC] bammbino: i dont think he can hire people after the whole catfishing fiasco
[2017-03-03 23:33:21 UTC] kingjadvcmp: it would not be difficult to edit out either in the editing software, you'd mainly look for the commentary audio parts that are just dead quiet - it means nothing is happening then usually, so can trim around it? That's how I edited previous stuff in past lol
[2017-03-03 23:33:48 UTC] annabac: because he doesnt stream full time, and he has the negativity around him, so why would people activly subscribe
[2017-03-03 23:33:51 UTC] annabac: as a newcomer
[2017-03-03 23:33:57 UTC] bodiebthewire: but he should look beyond "his" fan base......88 % of people like edited better
[2017-03-03 23:34:08 UTC] bammbino: @DragonJarvis, you have a point.. phil doesnt know what to do.. but his viewer base is spot on with their needs/wants.. its just he cant please everyone
[2017-03-03 23:34:37 UTC] bammbino: i know you all remember phil getting 30k+ views per review even in his dark times.. kogaming is NOT the answer
[2017-03-03 23:34:37 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Problem is Phil is just so goddamn stubborn to change to edited playthroughs. This is one change that ppl overwhelmingly want, it's a failure to adapt most of all, and that is destroying him.
[2017-03-03 23:34:40 UTC] ambervisage: fun thing is Phil livestreams almost everyday, right?
[2017-03-03 23:34:49 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: yeeah, only like 20% of twitch viewers sub and cheer, gotta take this into account
[2017-03-03 23:35:22 UTC] bammbino: @vsevolodeliseev, yea.. phil's BIGGEST mistake wasnt rambo.. wasnt the move to seattle.. it was stopping twitch
[2017-03-03 23:35:22 UTC] bodiebthewire: what im sayin is edit for youtibe....leave unedited on twitch
[2017-03-03 23:35:36 UTC] annabac: im comparing it to like succesfull twitch streamers AmberVisage
[2017-03-03 23:35:38 UTC] dragonjarvis: @bodiebthewire that is what I think aswell @Bammbino, yeah that is kinda what I mean so he should really do what other youtubers do, to generate new fans because if we personally like it or not, edited content is more popular for example,
[2017-03-03 23:35:57 UTC] annabac: he streams a lot, but not like 6 - 8 hours continously like they do
[2017-03-03 23:36:11 UTC] royal_phalanx91: As a new viewer, used to all the edited content out there, I would watch 5 minutes and go "fuck this, this is boring, I'm out"
[2017-03-03 23:36:13 UTC] ambervisage: i just wish people who like his raw unedited gameplay would be more supportive and more vocal.
[2017-03-03 23:36:20 UTC] shindigpsc: @bodiebthwire Agreed. Two audiences get catered for.
[2017-03-03 23:36:37 UTC] dragonjarvis: but this is just my opinion. I think phils Switch is not gonna come in the next half hour, so I will be playing Botw shortly. Game is awesome so far btw. you ppl will enjoy it!
[2017-03-03 23:36:39 UTC] bodiebthewire: yes but i dont know why he doesnt want to do it
[2017-03-03 23:36:55 UTC] faisalking11: I believe that sence its his job to play video games which is the best and easy job in the whole world he does not like/ enjoy it anymore at all
[2017-03-03 23:36:58 UTC] royal_phalanx91: So Phil has trouble with viewer retention. He should save the raw unedited stuff for Twitch highlights
[2017-03-03 23:36:58 UTC] bammbino: botw?
[2017-03-03 23:37:10 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil's lifestyle in general has not been great, he is awake until like 3am-4am sometimes, and used to start work at noon (and was not on time half the time lol),, he has moved back an hour since but still, 11am to begin your work is still very late for a lot of people. He should start earlier, IMO, to capitalise on the UK/European audience first
[2017-03-03 23:37:24 UTC] annabac: well, it could be personality also why people like dislike about someone, and talk about it louder than others AmberVisage
[2017-03-03 23:37:43 UTC] bammbino: @KingjadVCMP, i am normally not w/ you but yeah... his schedule is fucking dumb lol
[2017-03-03 23:37:55 UTC] kingjadvcmp: thank you for pointing that first bit out lol
[2017-03-03 23:38:17 UTC] ambervisage: @Annabac, Honestly his raw unedited gameplay is the reason i dont watch people like Markiplier anymore.
[2017-03-03 23:38:18 UTC] bammbino: well thats what makes us all a good comunity is that we have different views
[2017-03-03 23:38:33 UTC] kingjadvcmp: try telling that to vidar...
[2017-03-03 23:38:39 UTC] bodiebthewire: maybe he can outsource for editing...there are anough people who like him enough to do it for free
[2017-03-03 23:38:44 UTC] annabac: thats totally fine, and i do too
[2017-03-03 23:38:49 UTC] annabac: but it's not a big audience
[2017-03-03 23:38:50 UTC] shindigpsc: Even with that schedule, he shirked work in general which he could've fit around streaming.
[2017-03-03 23:39:05 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I actually got banned by Phil once for saying that he's made past mistakes and burned bridges, he needs to chill out on that
[2017-03-03 23:39:07 UTC] ambervisage: im not sure thats really safe to say
[2017-03-03 23:39:28 UTC] bammbino: @KingjadVCMP, talking about the drama over for honor's story not being historically accurate and using women with power?
[2017-03-03 23:39:28 UTC] kingjadvcmp: outsourcing for editing is a fiddly idea, for a variety of reasons. Firstly, do you mean to edit on to his raw channel? lot of footage needing given to someone, to then edit down, to them send back to Phil, to upload? Too time-consuming
[2017-03-03 23:39:39 UTC] ambervisage: people who watch Phil's youtube videos could just watch them cause they like them
[2017-03-03 23:40:15 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Editing videos should be an important committment for him, this is a JOB after all, so he should put in the time
[2017-03-03 23:40:21 UTC] annabac: again like me, i do enjoy them raw and stuff, but he changed a lot from 09 days
[2017-03-03 23:40:28 UTC] bammbino: @AmberVisage, YEP! when he plays a game i dont like/dont wanna play/watch i will go to and oldschool like kingdom hearts on one monitor and play LoL on the other
[2017-03-03 23:40:29 UTC] annabac: imo it's getting stale
[2017-03-03 23:40:30 UTC] ambervisage: without caring about anything else, which is why we never hear anything from them aside from a small group
[2017-03-03 23:40:39 UTC] bodiebthewire: i think he should do it himself
[2017-03-03 23:41:18 UTC] ambervisage: what i WOULD like is still having his raw unedited gameplay, but like have, weekly highlights of that gameplay with funny moments and shit.
[2017-03-03 23:41:35 UTC] babbyrage: he changed his commentary a lot past year
[2017-03-03 23:41:40 UTC] bodiebthewire: i still think thats a mistake
[2017-03-03 23:41:46 UTC] bammbino: one of the big issues with DSPGAMING that alot of people dont bring up is.... ADS.. we're in a day and age where adblock is on almost everyone's browsers
[2017-03-03 23:41:53 UTC] ambervisage: a mini montage for that specific playthrough
[2017-03-03 23:42:05 UTC] babbyrage: it was almost unfiltered
[2017-03-03 23:42:13 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Would he consider mixing up his schedule on twitch have one day multiplayer with subscribers, play a random game for a stream etc. on another He says himself after the first 1 or 2 streams the audience dies down. If he mixed it up a bit he may get new viewers
[2017-03-03 23:42:15 UTC] annabac: me too, but again we are talking about his business, if this is where he gets with this style of commentary
[2017-03-03 23:42:23 UTC] kingjadvcmp: if Phil did a morning stream at 9am, that's 5pm UK time, and elsewhere in Europe still wide awake too. Do that for like 3-4 hours, chill for a good bit for lunch/sorting videos/slight editing etc, can even manage dinner, and do second stream for US based audience. To me that seems sensible?
[2017-03-03 23:42:27 UTC] annabac: he doesnt make it
[2017-03-03 23:42:31 UTC] boxman222: first that is even more work and just because people like edited content they might not like what phil likes to call highly edited
[2017-03-03 23:42:43 UTC] ambervisage: i try and disable my adblock on Phil's videos
[2017-03-03 23:42:45 UTC] dragonjarvis: @Bammbino the adblocker is an issue that is true. on the other hand when he streams he atleast gets bits. I am off now later guys !
[2017-03-03 23:42:50 UTC] bodiebthewire: this is his lively hood he needs to step up
[2017-03-03 23:42:53 UTC] royal_phalanx91: @KingjadVCMP agreed
[2017-03-03 23:43:10 UTC] boxman222: it is possible to do a mostly raw gameplay by cutting out the parts where nothing happen like i explained before like backtracking
[2017-03-03 23:43:33 UTC] kingjadvcmp: now, that idea I just had - why do we think Phil will say it's not possible?
[2017-03-03 23:43:35 UTC] bammbino: EU has always been the biggest part of supporting this website.. he has to cater to EU friendly schedule while having one for USA
[2017-03-03 23:43:40 UTC] bodiebthewire: like whats the point of doin 25 min vids if theres 4 ads
[2017-03-03 23:43:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he has a set sleeping pattern taking on your idea would ruin that KingjadVCMP :P
[2017-03-03 23:43:59 UTC] faisalking11: how can someone fuck up the easiest job in the world lmaooo
[2017-03-03 23:44:09 UTC] kingjadvcmp: true, I think it's been a long time since Phil saw a clock at 9am lol
[2017-03-03 23:44:12 UTC] ambervisage: you're talking from experience, right?
[2017-03-03 23:44:21 UTC] bammbino: me? AmberVisage
[2017-03-03 23:44:21 UTC] annabac: if it was easy faisalking11 everyone would do it
[2017-03-03 23:44:23 UTC] boxman222: lets say he dies to a boss over and over again but has to backtrack 30 minutes.. then it would be a good idea to just cut out those 30 minutes unless something funny happens and just get to the point where he fights the boss again
[2017-03-03 23:44:28 UTC] bodiebthewire: well its is playin video games without editing
[2017-03-03 23:44:34 UTC] nomansskyvr: I'd really like to see Phil just focus on becoming a full time Twitch streamer
[2017-03-03 23:44:36 UTC] faisalking11: true
[2017-03-03 23:44:39 UTC] babbyrage: the problem is that phil is lazy as fuck. if you watch closely you can figure out exactly where each of the videos that will be going to youtube start and end.
[2017-03-03 23:44:51 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Also should Phil do Fan Appreciation multiplayer events more? He used to do things like TF2 and other games I remember playing with him in as part of the PC community round 2011-ish, also yeah, Phil says everything isn't possible lol
[2017-03-03 23:45:00 UTC] bodiebthewire: he aslos doesnt add his videos in order
[2017-03-03 23:45:01 UTC] bammbino: YES Royal_Phalanx91 YES!!!
[2017-03-03 23:45:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he should do more events with subscribers Royal_Phalanx91 anyway
[2017-03-03 23:45:19 UTC] ambervisage: @Bammbino, No, the one saying "how could you fuck up the easiest job in the world".
[2017-03-03 23:45:23 UTC] annabac: i think he should, but with the air around him would ruin his experience
[2017-03-03 23:45:23 UTC] bammbino: i dont care to play with phil EVER, but my fucking god.. fan appreciation has been the better part of dspgaming
[2017-03-03 23:45:27 UTC] annabac: and others for that matter
[2017-03-03 23:45:46 UTC] bammbino: BF4 coverage with and vs fans was too funny
[2017-03-03 23:45:49 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Remember playing counter strike global offensive with him, and tf2 lol
[2017-03-03 23:45:54 UTC] bodiebthewire: dont we al play games for free?
[2017-03-03 23:45:55 UTC] annabac: you KNOW the detractors are doing everything they can to troll
[2017-03-03 23:46:07 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil should definitely do more Patreon events, those guys deserve more for what they're giving IMO. Phil acts like it'd hurt his business to do that too much, but multiplayer stuff is fun IMO, especially if all enjoying it together, it'd still be uploaded to YouTube, probably at least the same kind of views as a normal vid would get too on the channel
[2017-03-03 23:46:18 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: coop with patrons always has low views
[2017-03-03 23:46:20 UTC] bammbino: not just them Annabaci now believe alot of his supporters grief him too
[2017-03-03 23:46:33 UTC] bodiebthewire: yes but they pay
[2017-03-03 23:46:40 UTC] annabac: they ride the bandwagon imo
[2017-03-03 23:46:44 UTC] bammbino: @vsevolodeliseev, yes cause its him playing w/ them with coms.. i respect that he does it tho
[2017-03-03 23:46:44 UTC] kingjadvcmp: precisely, the cost of the Patreon has covered the video expenses
[2017-03-03 23:46:57 UTC] annabac: hive mentality
[2017-03-03 23:47:07 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He should use comms for Overwatch, engage and chat with the participants
[2017-03-03 23:47:29 UTC] annabac: for sure
[2017-03-03 23:47:45 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He should also do it for other games he does co-op in too.
[2017-03-03 23:47:49 UTC] kingjadvcmp: there's a lot of subtle, minor things Phil could do to improve himself. A lot of this has been suggested already. It's up to Phil though, he's a big boy and it's his life, and his choices.
[2017-03-03 23:47:50 UTC] bodiebthewire: i did feel bad fro him when i saw his world of warcraft stream lol....he had 25 trolls chasin him
[2017-03-03 23:48:01 UTC] bammbino: just an example: his BF4 coverage had people like hacking_darts and chubbs stream snipe him even while being fans
[2017-03-03 23:48:31 UTC] kingjadvcmp: shit there's simple wee flash games Phil could play, like Agario, that'd be fun to see him play and rage at
[2017-03-03 23:48:33 UTC] bammbino: @bodiebthewire, i went and made a GM ticket and they were willing to take care of the issue if only he had made the ticket
[2017-03-03 23:48:34 UTC] royal_phalanx91: In his counter strike footage I always wanted to kill him or follow him around to get in the video lol
[2017-03-03 23:48:38 UTC] bodiebthewire: but he should just accept it n laugh it off
[2017-03-03 23:48:40 UTC] annabac: havent seen it but that should be fine right
[2017-03-03 23:48:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: That twitch and chill was one of his best streams. He should consider doing something similar once a week even if he does get a channel partnership
[2017-03-03 23:48:49 UTC] annabac: fans vs phil and phil and fans vs fans
[2017-03-03 23:49:13 UTC] bodiebthewire: people always go after those who they can get under there skin
[2017-03-03 23:49:18 UTC] annabac: i see the pain in phils eyes when he does twitch and chill xD
[2017-03-03 23:49:37 UTC] bammbino: the problem has been those that intentionally make phil lose or ruin the gameplay for everyone not just him
[2017-03-03 23:49:42 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil got slaughtered that event last weekend lol
[2017-03-03 23:49:48 UTC] annabac: you mean his teammates=
[2017-03-03 23:49:56 UTC] annabac: ?*
[2017-03-03 23:50:03 UTC] bammbino: yeah, rmemeber the mei in overwatch fucking everyone over?
[2017-03-03 23:50:14 UTC] bammbino: that drives even us regular gamers up the wall
[2017-03-03 23:50:22 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he can pick other games to play for it but it was pretty hilarious :P
[2017-03-03 23:50:28 UTC] annabac: no didnt see his overwatch stuff
[2017-03-03 23:50:28 UTC] bodiebthewire: Bambinno i didnt know that ya he should made a ticket
[2017-03-03 23:50:34 UTC] kingjadvcmp: a way to counteract the trolls in MP is to play it not live - wouldn't be able to streamsnipe
[2017-03-03 23:50:59 UTC] bammbino: hes never had an issue with snipers on the enemy team
[2017-03-03 23:51:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: didn't he do that for World of Warcraft KingjadVCMP and he still got messed with
[2017-03-03 23:51:06 UTC] bammbino: its on his team thats the core issue
[2017-03-03 23:51:06 UTC] annabac: but yeah i agree, it doesnt work out well in his situation to do mp
[2017-03-03 23:51:07 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I feel sure he was live
[2017-03-03 23:51:15 UTC] bodiebthewire: Phil‏Verified account @TheyCallMeDSPFeeling like this REALLY sucks. Having no idea what the right move is...it's scary. I could lose everything or win big. And I'm very nervous
[2017-03-03 23:51:20 UTC] annabac: but i can see a co-op with friends being enjoyable
[2017-03-03 23:51:27 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He should open up the Jackbox games like Quiplash to subscribers and patrons, I and others got pretty frustrated trying to get in (bethe :P), he could have a bit of a delay on stream if that's possible and RingGate was a classic DSP drama moment :D
[2017-03-03 23:51:41 UTC] kingjadvcmp: other Jackbox games too like that drawful
[2017-03-03 23:52:10 UTC] bammbino: i dont like those twitch an chill streams tbh.. he is doing it the wrong way atelast imo
[2017-03-03 23:52:22 UTC] kingjadvcmp: what would be the right way?
[2017-03-03 23:52:33 UTC] bodiebthewire: who knoes
[2017-03-03 23:52:38 UTC] annabac: ^
[2017-03-03 23:52:54 UTC] bammbino: its not about focusing solely on the chat over gameplay.. and its not about playing quiplash and let people insult him over and over
[2017-03-03 23:53:00 UTC] annabac: i dont like the twitch and chill either
[2017-03-03 23:53:12 UTC] bammbino: its about getting to know people like yacherdy, KingjadVCMP, bethe and more
[2017-03-03 23:53:15 UTC] kingjadvcmp: it's about rewarding the Patrons, surely
[2017-03-03 23:53:19 UTC] annabac: one big manhunt who can break phil
[2017-03-03 23:53:24 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :( no love for the pogo boomer runs in Choice Chamber
[2017-03-03 23:53:34 UTC] annabac: you see he is acting to troll the trolls
[2017-03-03 23:54:19 UTC] bammbino: @KingjadVCMP, sorry to use you as an example.. but i feel like he hasnt offered people a reason to sub other than to sub to support him or for emotes
[2017-03-03 23:54:49 UTC] bammbino: @KingjadVCMP, i often think that if he chatted with viewers and not insulted them, they'd be open to subbing w/o asking them to do it
[2017-03-03 23:54:58 UTC] bodiebthewire: amazin hes gettin more action in his stream after hes been goin almost 2 hours
[2017-03-03 23:55:01 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil's biggest problem has been his lifestyle - he let the early success dictate what his current life is. Look at the proof of it - he owns 2 houses and leases an expensive car. He's trying his best to rectify it now but he tried so hard to keep it going for so long, even relying on Patreon to subsidise YouTube when the income dried up
[2017-03-03 23:55:03 UTC] annabac: yup
[2017-03-03 23:55:19 UTC] phillkeked: do you know if he is streaming more today?
[2017-03-03 23:55:29 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Yes, Phil has made pretty poor long term decisions, and it's coming back to bite him
[2017-03-03 23:55:32 UTC] kingjadvcmp: it's hard feeling sorry for Phil and his money woes when we've not seen a lot of examples of his financial sacrifices
[2017-03-03 23:55:34 UTC] thunder_touch: DSP Tries it: My McDonalds Job
[2017-03-03 23:55:48 UTC] bammbino: contract and credit.. the best ways to fuck your life over
[2017-03-03 23:56:03 UTC] larzionius: The Summer is gonna kill him
[2017-03-03 23:56:09 UTC] royal_phalanx91: This is why I never like to take on debt
[2017-03-03 23:56:12 UTC] phillkeked: is he streaming more today guys or not i wanna see :(
[2017-03-03 23:56:13 UTC] bodiebthewire: he took loans also
[2017-03-03 23:56:23 UTC] bammbino: loans happen some cant avoid it
[2017-03-03 23:56:28 UTC] bammbino: but LEASES??? really?
[2017-03-03 23:56:29 UTC] annabac: yep he made bad money decisions, and showed it to the internet
[2017-03-03 23:56:32 UTC] annabac: also not wise
[2017-03-03 23:56:34 UTC] bammbino: you cant escape a lease
[2017-03-03 23:56:47 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he is unboxing the switch tonight on stream phillkeked
[2017-03-03 23:56:49 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Yeah, I was like HE FUCKING LEASES A CAR? Why don't you buy a cheap used one?
[2017-03-03 23:56:58 UTC] annabac: right
[2017-03-03 23:57:10 UTC] larzionius: @bodiebthewire i'm surprised a bank gave a loan to a YouTube Channel
[2017-03-03 23:57:37 UTC] kingjadvcmp: if Phil is gonna do twitch full time, schedule change is a must. Even if he keeps doing YouTube and Twitch, he has to adapt to cater for his global audience. I think he will get partnered by someone, so I'm gonna guess his legacy of videos are safe from copyright claims - will see
[2017-03-03 23:57:44 UTC] royal_phalanx91: At the time he satisfied the loan guys that he could handle it, but went things went to shit everything fell apart
[2017-03-03 23:57:59 UTC] phillkeked: man he has a following in my country
[2017-03-03 23:58:10 UTC] bammbino: im not perfect, i made stupid choices financially just like the next guy.. but one thing that awlays bugged me was "leasing a BMW" in connecticut.. i was born and raised there til 1997 and even i know you dont get nice vehicles there cause of the snow
[2017-03-03 23:58:21 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn no offense but the reasons not to get a part time job weren't the best. Imagine going to an unemployment officer and telling him\her those were the reasons you were claiming unemployment.
[2017-03-03 23:58:42 UTC] kingjadvcmp: there's another thing, he says he needs you to pay his bills but then immediately buys a Switch lol. He has to make sacrifices himself at times, growing up must happen
[2017-03-03 23:58:50 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I don't even know if Phil is eligible for unemployment benefits honestly
[2017-03-03 23:58:50 UTC] larzionius: Phil has set a standard for himself and he is not willing to go below that
[2017-03-03 23:59:06 UTC] bammbino: switch has been pre-purchased for a long time and its a tax write off
[2017-03-03 23:59:18 UTC] bodiebthewire: he was 3 months away from gettin out of his lease but it was right before he moved....n they talked him into leasing for 2 more years so he could avoid fines for his last lease
[2017-03-03 23:59:41 UTC] bammbino: his house is afforadble simply cause home offices are a tax write off here in the states
[2017-03-03 23:59:53 UTC] larzionius: He shouldn't off bit the hand that feeds him
