[2017-03-15 18:09:57 UTC] aglet57: yeah, but I didn't play Mario Kart 8 cause I didn't get Wii U
[2017-03-15 18:10:00 UTC] darksydephil: blaster master is 30 years old. baffles the mind why they're bringing that one back

[2017-03-15 18:11:42 UTC] darksydephil: theres no reason whatsoever to buy a switch right now unless you're an active early adopter or just want to get footage of it having a hardware failure lol

[2017-03-15 18:13:50 UTC] yacherdy: YUGE
[2017-03-15 18:13:54 UTC] darksydephil: id be disappointed about not getting to play Ultra SF2 if it wasn't just HD remix with 2 palette swap characters nobody will use, on an awful control scheme lol. but after just holding those joycons, i know the game will control like shit. and spending 80 bucks for a pro pad or over 100 for ajoystick for that game is a total ripofff
[2017-03-15 18:14:27 UTC] yacherdy: I heard the pro controller isn't the best for SF...D-pad seems off
[2017-03-15 18:14:29 UTC] blue_blur64: What'd you say about me while I failed to take the dog outside? Kappa

[2017-03-15 18:14:56 UTC] darksydephil: the pro controller being 80 bucks literally means 70 bucks profit for nintendo. that thing is a cheap pos

[2017-03-15 21:29:54 UTC] shega_ace: i have a question and it isn't spoilers but so far i have found nothing on it: if i beat the game do i have the option to reload so i can do all the shrines and stuff OR does it auto save and go to new game
[2017-03-15 21:29:58 UTC] voltairesurge: nope
[2017-03-15 21:30:03 UTC] shega_ace: i don't want to beat it then be screwed

[2017-03-15 21:32:40 UTC] bentboxer: phil should take shorter breaks
[2017-03-15 21:32:49 UTC] kinggoken: really @SofaKeeenGreat

[2017-03-15 21:34:04 UTC] voltairesurge: he wont
[2017-03-15 21:34:09 UTC] sofakeeengreat: @bentboxer no he returned it and got store credit
[2017-03-15 21:34:09 UTC] kinggoken: don't think so. I honestly think he is done with the switch lol.
[2017-03-15 21:34:10 UTC] vendatus: If the can is opened yes
[2017-03-15 21:34:35 UTC] bentboxer: good maybe he can use the money to get a ps4 pro
[2017-03-15 21:34:43 UTC] fatestayjedi: they still taste fine though
[2017-03-15 21:34:50 UTC] kinggoken: however, i kind of wanted to see how good he is on street fighter 2. Since Switch is getting a new street fighter 2 game.
[2017-03-15 21:34:52 UTC] sofakeeengreat: I don't think he's getting a PS4 pro neither lol
[2017-03-15 21:34:59 UTC] shega_ace: well the preservatives in canned fruit would stop it from going bad for a while but a week hmm

[2017-03-15 21:38:18 UTC] yacherdy: @bentboxer disagree but there's only been one version of the multiplayer.
[2017-03-15 21:38:19 UTC] mfd4419: Ok is it any fun
[2017-03-15 21:38:22 UTC] 007blaine: in p5 you can run in the Dungeon
[2017-03-15 21:38:24 UTC] soulofeden: Yeah bethe the ME MP is EA's way of saturating us with DLC's
[2017-03-15 21:38:25 UTC] yacherdy: @theycallmejimbob Said what?
[2017-03-15 21:38:27 UTC] vendatus: 10 hrs sp is time gated to a certain point
[2017-03-15 21:38:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: that origin access only allows you to play a certain amount of hours of the game YaCherdy :(
[2017-03-15 21:38:59 UTC] mxtt10589: I haven't been on a stream since Phil finished the water temple, can anyone catch me up on any story progress?
[2017-03-15 21:39:01 UTC] fatestayjedi: is new mass effect even any good? it seems like it could be boring and nowhere near interesting as first games
[2017-03-15 21:39:01 UTC] yacherdy: Oh, I didn't mean to ignore it...
[2017-03-15 21:39:06 UTC] mfd4419: Is mass effect worth getting you fucking retarded

[2017-03-15 21:40:46 UTC] voltairesurge: its funny. people think this mass effect looks boring but if you looked at the original games and tried to describe them those would sound exactly the same. so i doubt it will be boring.
[2017-03-15 21:40:48 UTC] soulofeden: Everyone looking forward to DSP playing the Ringed city? Last dark souls DLC
