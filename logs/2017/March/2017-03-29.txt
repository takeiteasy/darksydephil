[2017-03-29 18:27:14 UTC] mightysandwich: There's also that FF15 DLC
[2017-03-29 18:27:15 UTC] errnoent: @donniedarksouls Wait are you saying Phil duped his way to lvl 97? Have you completed the game? It's not hard to get that high of a level.
[2017-03-29 18:27:16 UTC] encelor: @DarksydePhil how are you doing today
[2017-03-29 18:27:27 UTC] reggiedlewis: Wish we could get to the game

[2017-03-29 18:28:00 UTC] wildgoose3: You should do one Overwtach stream per week I think. Reckon people would turn up for that.
[2017-03-29 18:28:13 UTC] ewojo: Hey Phil I'm trying to give 5 bucks to your patreon but it won't let me cause I don't have paypal

[2017-03-29 18:28:46 UTC] uf08mycat00: Ppl still think phil did the dupe glitch? Come on guys
[2017-03-29 18:28:48 UTC] playcool18: yeah seeing you rage like a bitch was fun
[2017-03-29 18:28:57 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: cheer50 Phil is the best overall Dark Souls player in the country.
[2017-03-29 18:28:58 UTC] reggiedlewis: Almost thirty minutes in. No gameplay. Sometimes...
[2017-03-29 18:29:04 UTC] donniedarksouls: in fact i would usuall finish demons souls around lv 70
[2017-03-29 18:29:05 UTC] betheboom: jimbob i saw no such apology
[2017-03-29 18:29:05 UTC] errnoent: @donniedarksouls Dude I finished at like 115 or higher in DS3.
[2017-03-29 18:29:19 UTC] donkyschlong69: running around. You can say that again.
[2017-03-29 18:29:23 UTC] mfd4419: Don't worry it gets harder
[2017-03-29 18:29:24 UTC] theycallmejimbob: chat was scrolling quickly yesterday betheboom you may of missed it
[2017-03-29 18:29:26 UTC] hayleyyx: Phil is the de facto god of games
[2017-03-29 18:29:26 UTC] zybatzuu: "Running around" you said it lol
[2017-03-29 18:29:34 UTC] betheboom: i got humble pie slow cooking for you once death 31 :D
[2017-03-29 18:29:36 UTC] akioartorius: rushing
[2017-03-29 18:29:42 UTC] donniedarksouls: @errnoent then for me that would be pretty overleveled
[2017-03-29 18:29:43 UTC] mfd4419: Rage let's get it
[2017-03-29 18:29:52 UTC] errnoent: @donniedarksouls Well actually that's not true, that was after a NG+ or two.. Still, considering Phil's skill level in the game it's not unusual at all
[2017-03-29 18:29:54 UTC] mfd4419: Rage baby rage
[2017-03-29 18:29:57 UTC] lvlpower: there dung pie on Phil ass xD
[2017-03-29 18:30:00 UTC] donniedarksouls: i finished ng plus at lower than that
[2017-03-29 18:30:01 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Kett's spawning from Dick Ryder's ass Kappa
[2017-03-29 18:30:02 UTC] capstonegaming: (running through the whole game) is what i heard
[2017-03-29 18:30:06 UTC] mfd4419: I'm on new game plus 5
[2017-03-29 18:30:15 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you can put it back in the oven betheboom I agreed to no such thing
[2017-03-29 18:30:20 UTC] ashfordian2015: i predict there will be zero rage today
[2017-03-29 18:30:21 UTC] azuredragoongx1: The funny thing is once Phil finds out everything he needs to do in a place, the amount of rage-inducing stuff drops
[2017-03-29 18:30:25 UTC] zybatzuu: You're over exaggerating lol, you skipped a whole area
[2017-03-29 18:30:25 UTC] donkyschlong69: thats what darksouls is about
[2017-03-29 18:30:34 UTC] grazface1701: hi phil i have preordered persona 5 for ps3 , i get it on wednesday

[2017-03-29 18:30:41 UTC] tigerflamessssss: RITA StinkyCheese RITA
[2017-03-29 18:30:42 UTC] errnoent: @donniedarksouls If you're getting a hard on with how low level you went the game through at, why not just do a lvl 1 run and dangle your e-balls on everyone?
[2017-03-29 18:30:42 UTC] humpiershaggy: The recommended level is 125
[2017-03-29 18:30:43 UTC] azuredragoongx1: So if you guys really want him to see everything, do you guys also want him to rage less?
[2017-03-29 18:30:50 UTC] betheboom: jimbob imma take it out and serve it to you at death 31 :P
[2017-03-29 18:30:51 UTC] capstonegaming: why design a segment that isnt needed for another that you can skip?
[2017-03-29 18:31:02 UTC] mfd4419: U under level philly boy
[2017-03-29 18:31:07 UTC] wildgoose3: Anyone think Slaven Bilic should be given a new contract?
[2017-03-29 18:31:08 UTC] capstonegaming: looks like from just wanted to get back to armored core and just threw it out
[2017-03-29 18:31:10 UTC] errnoent: @donniedarksouls If you've played these games enough you'd realize that levels don't really mean shit. It's all about weapons and spells
[2017-03-29 18:31:11 UTC] zah_rastafari: the last dlc whooped your ass imho haha
[2017-03-29 18:31:14 UTC] mfd4419: Lol

[2017-03-29 18:31:28 UTC] betheboom: you know what jimbob i will let you off this one time
[2017-03-29 18:31:30 UTC] donniedarksouls: @errnoent the reason i think phill cheated is because he said he farmed shrine of storms skeletons at like 300 souls a pop
[2017-03-29 18:31:36 UTC] tourmalines: iv got a blank screen
[2017-03-29 18:31:37 UTC] betheboom: /me throws humble pie in bin

[2017-03-29 18:32:18 UTC] mfd4419: We don't have to
[2017-03-29 18:32:19 UTC] donniedarksouls: yh man im talking about demons souls
