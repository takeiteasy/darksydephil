[2017-03-22 03:49:35 UTC] t2katarn: i thought it was cause they had manveir hair and he hates white dudes
[2017-03-22 03:49:40 UTC] djruno1: imagine the possibilities
[2017-03-22 03:50:14 UTC] t2katarn: do u think theyre open brain is behind that blue hairs

[2017-03-22 03:50:25 UTC] pelicanpencil: customisation can be tricky.. can take real artistry and time to get the best out of it
[2017-03-22 03:51:06 UTC] thekinginyell0w: @t2katarn yes, that's manveir's doing, but he's been fired and it was supposed to be patched very early
[2017-03-22 03:51:45 UTC] t2katarn: sweet alegedly fired thats hilarious

[2017-03-22 03:53:33 UTC] pelicanpencil: in one of phils first videos of this game, one of the asari pulled a ridiculously surprised face for a split second..
[2017-03-22 03:53:34 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Apparently the lead animator of this game was just some model who cosplayed FailFish
[2017-03-22 03:53:55 UTC] t2katarn: can you just swing your arms wildly punching the fresh air like in uncharted would really make the game more fun

[2017-03-22 03:57:47 UTC] thekinginyell0w: I think a lot of the hate is a little unwarranted, and mostly just backlash from manveers racist tweets

[2017-03-22 04:08:10 UTC] t2katarn: mass effect never had animation people just wander in frame then talk then wander off then are gone magicly
[2017-03-22 04:08:39 UTC] enigmatheory: look at that face, looks like an early 360 game

[2017-03-22 04:12:39 UTC] factorz26: this game is awful
[2017-03-22 04:12:40 UTC] t2katarn: amirite?
[2017-03-22 04:12:51 UTC] johnlovesgaming: @mickjones82, it is so glitched for my playthrough, people having weird jumpy animations when you talk to them. A bug where you die, but at the same time level up, so you get all your shields back, but you're stuck on the ground and can't move.
[2017-03-22 04:12:51 UTC] enigmatheory: @TheKinginYell0w, Not only that, but the artist they hired who has never worked on a single game in her life, made a piece of "digital art" that read "I Hate Men"
[2017-03-22 04:12:57 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @TheKinginYell0w It seems like SJW's have infested BioWare.
[2017-03-22 04:13:07 UTC] pelicanpencil: well, i need to see more of the main missions instead of this dicking around in the spaceship too
[2017-03-22 04:13:16 UTC] factorz26: mass effect is no longer mass effect
[2017-03-22 04:13:23 UTC] enigmatheory: They also purposely made the women in this game unattractive to suit their agendas
[2017-03-22 04:13:24 UTC] howlinthedeep: oh god Enigmatheory sounds like a recipe for disaster
[2017-03-22 04:13:31 UTC] factorz26: this is something walking around in its skin
[2017-03-22 04:13:39 UTC] johnlovesgaming: @mickjones82, animations are so wacked out, in certain scenarios.
[2017-03-22 04:13:43 UTC] pelicanpencil: that sounds like reach enigmatheory
[2017-03-22 04:13:47 UTC] djruno1: is there actually a playlist with all the songs from and for phil?

[2017-03-22 04:14:45 UTC] johnlovesgaming: I haven't played through the entire game, but it would be funny, if you do not interact with Sara Ryder for the whole game when she is awake LUL.
[2017-03-22 04:14:53 UTC] pelicanpencil: and some of these chicks look okay, so colour me skeptical about that theory

[2017-03-22 04:25:37 UTC] sanguinenite: they should have shortened the intro
[2017-03-22 04:25:38 UTC] enigmatheory: EA has lost all of my interest. The first big one was Sim City for me
[2017-03-22 04:25:40 UTC] pelicanpencil: probably bail on this playthrough before it gets too far, and see what phil's review is
[2017-03-22 04:25:41 UTC] royal_phalanx91: This is a Frostbite game, is barely moddable tbh
[2017-03-22 04:25:47 UTC] johnlovesgaming: @Darksydephil, Well Phil, my playthrough is riddled with bugs man. Game-breaking bugs LUL. Like being stuck to a floor and can't move type of bugs...

[2017-03-22 04:27:10 UTC] enigmatheory: Both are run by fascist SJW's and have ruined amazing franchises :/
[2017-03-22 04:27:16 UTC] johnlovesgaming: EA ruined Battlefront and Battlefield, so I wouldn't be surprised tbh.
[2017-03-22 04:27:19 UTC] thekinginyell0w: I agree with Phil, it doesn't seem anywhere near as bad as the hate it's getting
[2017-03-22 04:27:33 UTC] illobear: hello ✌🙂
[2017-03-22 04:27:37 UTC] bammbino: @Royal_Phalanx91, sold to EA and left the company.. then bioware had 2 studios and they had a falling out due to clique mentality

[2017-03-22 17:34:01 UTC] betheboom: and it was only 1 guy who did it :(
[2017-03-22 17:34:21 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn sorry to hear that bethe is that close to where you're living in London?
[2017-03-22 17:34:47 UTC] betheboom: jimbob not really but its close enough
[2017-03-22 17:36:21 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn London will be gridlock now (more than usual) with the lock down in place
[2017-03-22 17:36:28 UTC] theycallmejimbob: is Phil streaming today?
[2017-03-22 17:36:43 UTC] betheboom: yes
[2017-03-22 17:37:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: how does this dood have Mass Effect before you bethe :D
[2017-03-22 17:41:11 UTC] betheboom: cheated
[2017-03-22 17:41:44 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he's doing an insanity blind run
[2017-03-22 17:41:49 UTC] theycallmejimbob: best of luck with that
[2017-03-22 17:51:56 UTC] betheboom: the police officer who got stabbed died :(
[2017-03-22 17:53:03 UTC] yacherdy: Hello

[2017-03-22 17:53:13 UTC] betheboom: :(
[2017-03-22 17:53:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :( poor bethe
[2017-03-22 17:53:20 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey YaCherdy
[2017-03-22 17:53:27 UTC] betheboom: cherdy terrorist attack :( injured 10 people, killed 1 and a police officer got multiple stabbed. westminister bridge, millenium wheel and houses of parliment in lock down :(
[2017-03-22 17:53:27 UTC] yacherdy: What? :(
[2017-03-22 17:53:39 UTC] betheboom: killed 2 sorry
[2017-03-22 17:53:43 UTC] yacherdy: Oh no :(
[2017-03-22 17:53:58 UTC] betheboom: too close to me man :(
[2017-03-22 17:54:00 UTC] yacherdy: Damn
[2017-03-22 17:54:35 UTC] yacherdy: I'm glad you're okay but that sucks for the people killed and injured and those affected.
[2017-03-22 17:54:42 UTC] yacherdy: :(
[2017-03-22 17:54:49 UTC] yacherdy: Sad
[2017-03-22 17:56:26 UTC] sanguinenite: I hear that hosting people helps boost viewership, which makes sense since ppl like me that follow DSP go to your channel
[2017-03-22 17:56:59 UTC] betheboom: cherdy and all that was 1 person
[2017-03-22 17:57:34 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @sanguinenite It's more seen as an act of kindness. 99% of the channel's viewership tends to not care who that streamer is.
[2017-03-22 17:58:02 UTC] yacherdy: Piece of shit they are bethe
[2017-03-22 17:58:44 UTC] sanguinenite: @LemonPlaysGames WTF.... Then what's the point of them being on Twitch?
[2017-03-22 17:58:56 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @sanguinenite What is the point indeed..
[2017-03-22 18:00:05 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I think what makes a difference is when someone finishes up their stream and the streamer 'raids' another stream with his/her audience.
[2017-03-22 18:00:33 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @theycallmejimbob Then More than 99% of that audience ends up leaving right after ;)
[2017-03-22 18:00:39 UTC] lemonplaysgames: It's just how it goes really.
[2017-03-22 18:00:46 UTC] betheboom: motherfucker was driving down the bridge zig zagging and running people over then he crashed into a wall and booked it into the houses of parliment front gate which was open (always is) and then a police officer followed and got stabbed repeatedly and now london in lockdown :(
[2017-03-22 18:01:12 UTC] bentboxer: its all over the news here @betheboom
[2017-03-22 18:01:23 UTC] betheboom: same here :(
[2017-03-22 18:01:30 UTC] yacherdy: What a cunt
[2017-03-22 18:01:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: wasn't it today or yesterday the big day for brexit?
[2017-03-22 18:02:05 UTC] theycallmejimbob: true I guess Lemon but for a small streamer getting 20 more viewers it helps
[2017-03-22 18:02:15 UTC] betheboom: jimbob the prime minister was IN the houses f parliment
