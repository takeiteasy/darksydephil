[2017-03-20 17:31:22 UTC] aglet57: hello twitch
[2017-03-20 17:41:28 UTC] thecommod0re: dspHmm
[2017-03-20 17:42:01 UTC] sanguinenite: @theCommod0re Here early?
[2017-03-20 17:42:42 UTC] poorlymade: hi
[2017-03-20 17:42:50 UTC] sanguinenite: Hello
[2017-03-20 17:42:56 UTC] punishedaglet: hi
[2017-03-20 17:43:14 UTC] poorlymade: excited for mass effect?
[2017-03-20 17:43:23 UTC] punishedaglet: I am not
[2017-03-20 17:43:45 UTC] sanguinenite: not really heard phil talk about it
[2017-03-20 17:44:16 UTC] punishedaglet: I know early reviews shouldnt be taken seriously yet but if the first 10 hours are shit, why should I want to play it?
[2017-03-20 17:44:43 UTC] sanguinenite: I think that ppl that follow DSP usually dont watch IGN and other similar channels that we get spoiled. They say it is shit but hey we will all know once phil plays it right?
[2017-03-20 17:44:44 UTC] punishedaglet: and those animations are inexcusable in 2017
[2017-03-20 17:45:26 UTC] punishedaglet: yeah I'm holding out for a legit review but I have no expectations
[2017-03-20 17:45:41 UTC] sanguinenite: We have seen pretty bad games last year, I wont be surprised if 2017 has another No Man Sky
[2017-03-20 17:45:48 UTC] punishedaglet: if its a 30 hour game and the first 10 are awful, why would i want to play the other 20?
[2017-03-20 17:45:55 UTC] punishedaglet: yeah
[2017-03-20 17:47:14 UTC] sanguinenite: I think the economy tanking really has made most games to be shovelled out shit. Few people do anything artistic that isnt for the money anymore. Maybe not "anymore" just very few. I find myself playing old games since the new ones are all shit.
[2017-03-20 17:47:38 UTC] punishedaglet: Horizon was pretty good. but that's about it.
[2017-03-20 17:47:42 UTC] punishedaglet: weak time for gaming
[2017-03-20 17:47:51 UTC] punishedaglet: lots of sequels and retreads
[2017-03-20 17:48:08 UTC] sanguinenite: Horizon zero dawn was decent but nothing that hasnt already been seen before
[2017-03-20 17:48:20 UTC] punishedaglet: Zelda looks good. getting it with my switch (whenever that happens) but I need something new
[2017-03-20 17:48:23 UTC] sanguinenite: A lot of remastered games
[2017-03-20 17:48:57 UTC] punishedaglet: the biggest things I've heard people talking about upcoming are another Last of Us, another Red Dead. need something spectacular and new
[2017-03-20 17:49:18 UTC] sanguinenite: Hardly any original games anymore, a lot of hype no living up to expectations
[2017-03-20 17:49:24 UTC] punishedaglet: yah
[2017-03-20 17:49:54 UTC] sanguinenite: Good thing we have people like Phil that play the game for us to tell us that we were right about them being shit or unoriginal
[2017-03-20 17:50:20 UTC] punishedaglet: I appreciate most of Phil's stuff. if it's a game I'm not interested at all in though, I leave
[2017-03-20 17:50:28 UTC] sanguinenite: Same
[2017-03-20 17:50:33 UTC] punishedaglet: like I enjoy this Zelda playthrough, so I'm going to get it
[2017-03-20 17:51:00 UTC] punishedaglet: but I wasn't interested in Resident Evil anymore, so I bailed
[2017-03-20 17:51:51 UTC] sanguinenite: The only games I usually follow are visual novels. Most other games are boring to me. I think the most important part of a game is the story.
[2017-03-20 17:52:11 UTC] punishedaglet: I play more sport than anything
[2017-03-20 17:52:23 UTC] sanguinenite: You mean EA sports or like real sports?
[2017-03-20 17:52:44 UTC] punishedaglet: Like I'm still playing MLB The Show from like 4 years ago
[2017-03-20 17:53:03 UTC] punishedaglet: Road to the Show mode is addictive
[2017-03-20 17:53:22 UTC] sanguinenite: why is it addictive? what makes it so special from other game mode?
[2017-03-20 17:53:46 UTC] punishedaglet: I like making my own guy and playing through every game to get to the majors
[2017-03-20 17:53:55 UTC] punishedaglet: Like, every single game
[2017-03-20 17:54:15 UTC] bobbi_ling: ol right mateys

[2017-03-20 17:56:20 UTC] bobbi_ling: aye aye
[2017-03-20 17:56:22 UTC] sanguinenite: Asia, it is f-ing late here, the only reason I am here now is because of PDT
[2017-03-20 17:56:35 UTC] errnoent: hello guys

[2017-03-20 17:57:18 UTC] errnoent: Just a guess :)
[2017-03-20 17:57:20 UTC] sanguinenite: erronoent got it right
[2017-03-20 17:58:05 UTC] bobbi_ling: singapore in 2017 MingLee
[2017-03-20 17:58:10 UTC] sanguinenite: eh good guess, I dont expect many fans of phil to be from where I am at but I guess there must be since you could guess the right name XD

[2017-03-20 18:00:14 UTC] bobbi_ling: wait so am i...
[2017-03-20 18:00:16 UTC] errnoent: @sanguinenite Hah, I've never stepped my ass outside of the USA except for a trip down to Mexico. I think it's just because I've talked to a lot of people from different countries in Asia and have gotten used to the different ways English is spoken around there. Also I don't think twitch has a huge following anywhere else in Asia really.
[2017-03-20 18:00:25 UTC] 0megaj0ker: what happened with the captured Gerudo guard yesterday? cmonBruh
[2017-03-20 18:00:48 UTC] sanguinenite: @errnoent Yeah good point XD.
[2017-03-20 18:01:00 UTC] br_king: What day does Andromyda start? I want to laugh at it.
[2017-03-20 18:01:08 UTC] punishedaglet: lol
[2017-03-20 18:01:10 UTC] darksydephil: so today I'll be streaming at 6000kbps per Twitch's increased streaming limitations
[2017-03-20 18:01:12 UTC] sanguinenite: I think today BR King
[2017-03-20 18:01:17 UTC] bobbi_ling: andromeda is tonight
[2017-03-20 18:01:20 UTC] darksydephil: let's see if it looks better. probably not since the game is only 720p anyway
[2017-03-20 18:01:21 UTC] hiakinet: Hi Phil
[2017-03-20 18:01:24 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Neat SeemsGood

[2017-03-20 18:02:51 UTC] darksydephil: should be interesting to see how that streams at 6kbps tonight. and ill be recording/streaming that in 1080p
[2017-03-20 18:02:58 UTC] howlinthedeep: Hi all

[2017-03-20 18:03:25 UTC] darksydephil: okay im gonna start the stream
[2017-03-20 18:03:26 UTC] br_king: it's 30fps on both PS4 and PS4 Pro according to an article I found
[2017-03-20 18:03:44 UTC] howlinthedeep: 6kbps should be much better
[2017-03-20 18:03:54 UTC] bentboxer: no way it has to be 60 fps on the ps pro
[2017-03-20 18:04:02 UTC] howlinthedeep: Hi sanguinenite
[2017-03-20 18:04:29 UTC] bobbi_ling: nioh only 60 fps game in 2017 MingLee
[2017-03-20 18:04:39 UTC] darksydephil: well i used to stream at 8-9k on youtube so this should work fine. fingers crossed lol
[2017-03-20 18:04:56 UTC] darksydephil: btw i now have 213 subs. i actually had like 219 but a few people lapsed overnight
[2017-03-20 18:04:58 UTC] darksydephil: hopefully they renew!
[2017-03-20 18:05:00 UTC] howlinthedeep: Ahh the Sony ponies are mad that their PS4 pro can't get 60 fps
[2017-03-20 18:05:04 UTC] br_king: According to some article from GameRant it's 30fps on both. They speculate it's to keep multiplayer fair.
[2017-03-20 18:05:14 UTC] encelor: hello everyone

[2017-03-20 19:37:37 UTC] yacherdy: @0megaj0ker I think extended cut improved it by a lot
[2017-03-20 19:37:42 UTC] yacherdy: did someone say mod?
[2017-03-20 19:37:42 UTC] megamannt125: After that ending and the Tali debacle, it was clear Bioware was in decline and getting lazier

[2017-03-20 19:38:17 UTC] bammbino: @HowlintheDeep, do you think some of his mods are protesting against being mods here? i always felt his old stream chat had mods
[2017-03-20 19:38:19 UTC] yacherdy: @Megamannt125 original ending was a misstep and the Tali thing was dumb but good game overall for me.
[2017-03-20 19:38:29 UTC] gammaion1: I'm tempted to buy a Wii U to play it

[2017-03-20 19:38:59 UTC] derichloveslemur: let me try to figure it out
[2017-03-20 19:39:05 UTC] yacherdy: @0megaj0ker I think it was trying to show up in a form that you've seen throughout the game...had dreams of the kid all throughout the game.
[2017-03-20 19:39:10 UTC] 0megaj0ker: would be interesting if the AI takes the form of Deceased characters from the ME franchise
[2017-03-20 19:39:12 UTC] howlinthedeep: gino used to always be here
[2017-03-20 19:39:12 UTC] megamannt125: this dungeon is so fucking confusing i'm getting flashbacks just watching phil
[2017-03-20 19:39:19 UTC] howlinthedeep: same as marle

[2017-03-20 19:39:54 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, Did you rotate the middle section of the Naboris until you can see two chests, both on their sides, attached to the central platform.
[2017-03-20 19:39:58 UTC] bammbino: @HowlintheDeep, i thought marle was cool, always interacted with chat.. i guess he fooled us all
[2017-03-20 19:40:04 UTC] mizzle1987: @darksydephil How many shrines have you done/found so far??
[2017-03-20 19:40:05 UTC] vendatus: side holes CoolStoryBob
[2017-03-20 19:40:12 UTC] betheboom: tali, wrex, joker and garrus are the most loyal crew a guy could have, they are in all 3 games
[2017-03-20 19:40:14 UTC] gammaion1: so, the dungeons in this game are all contained within mechanized beasts?
[2017-03-20 19:40:19 UTC] megamannt125: Yeah

[2017-03-20 19:41:05 UTC] derichloveslemur: terminal 2: Head back to the map room and stand in the circular entrance to the room. Rotate the middle platform until it’s reset so the two chests are in the middle of the room on their sides again.
