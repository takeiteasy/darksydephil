[2017-03-06 18:34:32 UTC] clesstheangei: hi there FrankerZ
[2017-03-06 18:35:42 UTC] clesstheangei: curious to see what phil thinks of zelda
[2017-03-06 18:36:01 UTC] royal_phalanx91: yo we're early lol
[2017-03-06 18:37:13 UTC] finiteresource: hype is high
[2017-03-06 18:37:15 UTC] samendolar1: I'm here for the raw, unedited gameplay
[2017-03-06 18:37:33 UTC] clesstheangei: I died 15 seconds into the game lol xD
[2017-03-06 18:37:37 UTC] royal_phalanx91: rahw unedited cahntent
[2017-03-06 18:37:45 UTC] finiteresource: and for the continuation of 8 year legacy
[2017-03-06 18:38:08 UTC] clesstheangei: not counting the cutscenes and all i mean
[2017-03-06 18:38:39 UTC] betheboom: no spoilers
[2017-03-06 18:38:56 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Zelda kills Dumbledore
[2017-03-06 18:39:05 UTC] betheboom: anyway i'm loving zelda
[2017-03-06 18:39:18 UTC] blue_blur64: Did you jump off the ledge? Kappa
[2017-03-06 18:39:39 UTC] betheboom: cahman silent what if phil saw that he would be like a ledge?
[2017-03-06 18:40:15 UTC] royal_phalanx91: is there much difference between the wii u and the switch versions?
[2017-03-06 18:40:21 UTC] betheboom: nah
[2017-03-06 18:40:30 UTC] betheboom: just that the switch is 900p
[2017-03-06 18:40:53 UTC] betheboom: but its only 900p when docked
[2017-03-06 18:41:08 UTC] clesstheangei: XD lol no i attacked some monsters on a cliff above and they killed my ass
[2017-03-06 18:41:11 UTC] clesstheangei: jumped me more like
[2017-03-06 18:41:15 UTC] finiteresource: who here has switch?
[2017-03-06 18:41:16 UTC] betheboom: :D
[2017-03-06 18:41:19 UTC] clesstheangei: me attacking with tree branches and shit
[2017-03-06 18:41:22 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, Digital Foundry did a comparison vid, and there's barely any difference, which I was surprised about. But now that I think about it, since it only took a year for them to fully port Zelda to the switch, so it makes sense
[2017-03-06 18:41:28 UTC] betheboom: lol cless
[2017-03-06 18:42:10 UTC] betheboom: silent im glad about it, i dont want a shit version just because i choose the wii u over the switch
[2017-03-06 18:42:15 UTC] 007blaine: so 1 pm
[2017-03-06 18:42:35 UTC] blue_blur64: *2 pm

[2017-03-06 18:42:49 UTC] betheboom: lol
[2017-03-06 18:42:56 UTC] clesstheangei: after seeing phil's switch brick i've been taking care of my switch like it was a million dollar console lol
[2017-03-06 18:43:16 UTC] betheboom: cless yeah you keep doing that :D
[2017-03-06 18:43:33 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, I was careful to start, but I've been super careful now. And my brother actually had the game crash once
[2017-03-06 18:43:43 UTC] clesstheangei: damn seriously?
[2017-03-06 18:43:58 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, but it's very quick with restarting the whole thing
[2017-03-06 18:44:02 UTC] darksydephil: hello folks
[2017-03-06 18:44:09 UTC] philtheboss2367: Yeah I'm gonna wait to get my switch :/
[2017-03-06 18:44:12 UTC] finiteresource: hello Phil
[2017-03-06 18:44:20 UTC] blue_blur64: All it took was 2 presses of the power button and it was back to normal
[2017-03-06 18:44:41 UTC] clesstheangei: ah I'm glad it fixed at least hidden
[2017-03-06 18:44:44 UTC] dargonsouls: hello
[2017-03-06 18:45:07 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm not hidden Kappa
[2017-03-06 18:45:16 UTC] clesstheangei: silentwarrior

[2017-03-06 18:45:19 UTC] blue_blur64: LUL
[2017-03-06 18:45:21 UTC] betheboom: phil you ready for some zelda action
[2017-03-06 18:45:26 UTC] clesstheangei: XD I keep gettin you two confused
[2017-03-06 18:45:38 UTC] philtheboss2367: Your name is Hidden now Kappa
[2017-03-06 18:45:49 UTC] finiteresource: woooo the hype is real

[2017-03-06 18:46:03 UTC] betheboom: cless how hidden isnt even here anymore
[2017-03-06 18:46:06 UTC] darksydephil: but im wondering what the bit threshhold should be
[2017-03-06 18:46:13 UTC] darksydephil: it's gotta be at least 50 i think to prevent spam
[2017-03-06 18:46:13 UTC] blue_blur64: Well hopefully you don't have the issues you had Saturday
[2017-03-06 18:46:18 UTC] 007blaine: hi phil
[2017-03-06 18:46:20 UTC] blue_blur64: 50 sounds fine
[2017-03-06 18:46:30 UTC] clesstheangei: back then i kept getting confused between hidden boss and silentwarrior
[2017-03-06 18:46:32 UTC] darksydephil: wait until you see what i've got set upt!
[2017-03-06 18:46:35 UTC] darksydephil: hello blaine
[2017-03-06 18:46:43 UTC] darksydephil: hows it going?
[2017-03-06 18:46:44 UTC] blue_blur64: And just a heads up, but I found somebody else with shit luck like you had Saturday xD
[2017-03-06 18:46:49 UTC] silentgeneral: Hi phil :)
[2017-03-06 18:46:59 UTC] clesstheangei: lol i forgot who i added on my wii u back then who was named blue blur
[2017-03-06 18:47:08 UTC] clesstheangei: now i know who xD
[2017-03-06 18:47:14 UTC] blue_blur64: Now you know Kappa
[2017-03-06 18:47:14 UTC] goldencolts: airhorn.wav airhorn.wav for every bit and sub??? BabyRage BabyRage
[2017-03-06 18:47:23 UTC] philtheboss2367: Phil you're lucky you got the last copy of Zelda lol
[2017-03-06 18:47:26 UTC] goldencolts: i said airhorn wav and it thought link
[2017-03-06 18:48:24 UTC] finiteresource: 50 bits minimum seems reasonable
[2017-03-06 18:48:27 UTC] blue_blur64: Cless, have you seen some of the blunders people made on twitch and youtube? xD
[2017-03-06 18:48:31 UTC] blue_blur64: With Zelda
[2017-03-06 18:48:32 UTC] poorlymade: hey
[2017-03-06 18:48:37 UTC] darksydephil: ok im about to test these messages
[2017-03-06 18:49:14 UTC] 007blaine: my birthday is the 20th
[2017-03-06 18:50:03 UTC] darksydephil: happy birthday blaine! in case i dont see you before then lol

[2017-03-06 18:50:42 UTC] darksydephil: oh yeah, ive had my channel set to autohost since the other day, wonder if it even worked
[2017-03-06 18:51:00 UTC] failystone: THere were some cool Dark Souls streams on
[2017-03-06 18:51:20 UTC] blue_blur64: I popped in late one night and you were hosting a dark souls stream
[2017-03-06 18:51:44 UTC] clesstheangei: ah auto hosting others, good idea
[2017-03-06 18:51:49 UTC] darksydephil: oh okay!
[2017-03-06 18:51:54 UTC] darksydephil: so it was working, that's great then
[2017-03-06 18:52:01 UTC] dargonsouls: @DarksydePhil, autohost did work
[2017-03-06 18:52:03 UTC] darksydephil: yeah i set it up for 2 DS streamers, arturo and one other guy who does random stuff
[2017-03-06 18:52:28 UTC] darksydephil: actually dargon aren't you one of them? lol
[2017-03-06 18:52:39 UTC] dargonsouls: Yeah, it hosted me and TolomeoR back to back
[2017-03-06 18:52:43 UTC] blue_blur64: :D
[2017-03-06 18:52:43 UTC] dargonsouls: SeemsGood
[2017-03-06 18:52:45 UTC] darksydephil: wow nice
[2017-03-06 18:52:49 UTC] poorlymade: Dargon are you DragonSouls5 on YouTube?
[2017-03-06 18:52:51 UTC] poorlymade: I love you stuff!
[2017-03-06 18:52:56 UTC] darksydephil: i dont mind, no skin off my back to do that
[2017-03-06 18:53:02 UTC] dargonsouls: Nice!
[2017-03-06 18:54:41 UTC] poorlymade: Excited for Zelda today :)
[2017-03-06 18:54:45 UTC] darksydephil: by the way, since zelda is only 900p, im recording at 720p
[2017-03-06 18:54:54 UTC] blue_blur64: Well on Wii U Zelda is 720p
[2017-03-06 18:54:56 UTC] darksydephil: because im having TONS of trouble recording at 1080p with obs for some reason. so fuck all that
[2017-03-06 18:55:00 UTC] darksydephil: oh, it is?!
[2017-03-06 18:55:03 UTC] darksydephil: well that's a no brainer then!
[2017-03-06 18:55:05 UTC] marky117: ye
[2017-03-06 18:55:08 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah LUL
[2017-03-06 18:55:18 UTC] finiteresource: when you getting switch phil
[2017-03-06 18:55:25 UTC] marky117: lol
[2017-03-06 18:55:29 UTC] darksydephil: i have a lot to talk about on prestream today
[2017-03-06 18:55:32 UTC] donniedarksouls: Is the switch the more powerful console?
[2017-03-06 18:55:36 UTC] blue_blur64: And it's fortunate to know Phil that there's barely any difference between Wii U and Switch versions besides the 900p when docked
[2017-03-06 18:55:41 UTC] darksydephil: 2 really positive things and one negative, and the negative thing is REALLY suspect
[2017-03-06 18:55:43 UTC] blue_blur64: I would say so donnie
[2017-03-06 18:55:44 UTC] donniedarksouls: New partner phil?
[2017-03-06 18:55:45 UTC] poorlymade: Hope everything is going well Phil
[2017-03-06 18:55:56 UTC] clesstheangei: try to keep your spirits up phil
[2017-03-06 18:55:57 UTC] 0megaj0ker: the Bricking is real Kappa
[2017-03-06 18:56:00 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: the only reason for him to get one now is street fighter
[2017-03-06 18:56:07 UTC] poorlymade: Are you doing face cam? Honestly I really enjoy it, especially for vlog type content.
[2017-03-06 18:56:19 UTC] failystone: We will get through this, whatever it is
[2017-03-06 18:56:21 UTC] blue_blur64: Although Zelda is kind of a bad game to judge the console's power since it is a port that took 1 year to make
[2017-03-06 18:56:30 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: i heard this game gets sub 20 fps
[2017-03-06 18:56:46 UTC] 007blaine: i will be coming to your stream on the 20th
[2017-03-06 18:56:52 UTC] blue_blur64: From my experience, it does, but never during combat
[2017-03-06 18:56:53 UTC] 0megaj0ker: which one is the port?
[2017-03-06 18:56:59 UTC] blue_blur64: The Switch version
[2017-03-06 18:57:00 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I forgot :/
[2017-03-06 18:57:02 UTC] clesstheangei: The FPS of this game isn't even that bad lol -.-
[2017-03-06 18:57:11 UTC] 0megaj0ker: @blue_blur64 thanks
[2017-03-06 18:57:12 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: infact it kinda reminds me of the last guardian in alot of ways.
[2017-03-06 18:57:37 UTC] betheboom: dont not compare zelda to the last fuckin guardian
[2017-03-06 18:57:41 UTC] blue_blur64: Far From Subtle made that comparison too with how Link looks compared to the world
[2017-03-06 18:57:47 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: the art style i mean
[2017-03-06 18:57:57 UTC] betheboom: oh
[2017-03-06 18:58:07 UTC] 0megaj0ker: at first Nintendo was swimming in money, now they're losing money :D
[2017-03-06 18:58:23 UTC] blue_blur64: Actually, in Q3 they made money
[2017-03-06 18:58:52 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Q3?
[2017-03-06 18:59:05 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: i wonder where this game is in the zelda timeline?
[2017-03-06 18:59:05 UTC] blue_blur64: Hold on, I need to find the video

[2017-03-06 18:59:49 UTC] clesstheangei: Well apparently the sales of the switch has been one of the better console releases in a while, at least thats what gamestop has shown
[2017-03-06 18:59:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey thekingofcrybabyshd dood
[2017-03-06 18:59:59 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: the zelda timeline is really weird.
[2017-03-06 18:59:59 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: ayy
[2017-03-06 19:00:05 UTC] popsicolo: Nintendo stocks are up 4.5% TriHard
[2017-03-06 19:00:10 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: not as messed up as the x-men timeline though
[2017-03-06 19:00:20 UTC] clesstheangei: lol

[2017-03-06 19:00:44 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: a 40 year old white midget from 1973 becomes a large black man in 2006
[2017-03-06 19:00:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah ok lvlpower
[2017-03-06 19:01:00 UTC] blue_blur64: Well crap I can't remember the video that talked about their increased revenue D:
[2017-03-06 19:01:27 UTC] lvlpower: @theycallmejimbob probably will be back 4:00pm
[2017-03-06 19:01:33 UTC] popsicolo: If you want to see a weird timeline, look up the Spongebob timeline. Today's the day Squidward gets frozen for 2000 years.
[2017-03-06 19:01:42 UTC] betheboom: oh pepsicola and jimbob are here
