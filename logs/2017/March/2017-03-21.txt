[2017-03-21 02:51:12 UTC] therealkingghidorah: I need more sprite

[2017-03-21 02:56:13 UTC] therealkingghidorah: anyone else see Kong: Skull Island?
[2017-03-21 02:56:21 UTC] doctorzzz: not yet
[2017-03-21 02:56:30 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Nope. Not my type of movie.
[2017-03-21 02:56:42 UTC] therealkingghidorah: good film. solid B+
[2017-03-21 02:57:09 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Nice glad you enjoyed it
[2017-03-21 02:57:25 UTC] therealkingghidorah: it had some Post credit hype doh
[2017-03-21 02:57:39 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: I'm too picky about what I watch. How was the story
[2017-03-21 02:58:38 UTC] doctorzzz: i gernerally watch everything
[2017-03-21 02:58:50 UTC] therealkingghidorah: @neobornbloodmoonspartan9 the story is what you would expect. but the actors performances bring the believability and charm especially John C. Rielly
[2017-03-21 02:59:14 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Ah, I might consider watching it later then.
[2017-03-21 03:00:12 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: I'm more of the ''watch the likely Oscar nominee type movie''. I watched Lala Land and Moonlight this past year. That was about it for new movies.
[2017-03-21 03:00:20 UTC] yacherdy: Hey
[2017-03-21 03:00:42 UTC] yacherdy: Movie talk?
[2017-03-21 03:00:42 UTC] doctorzzz: well lalaland was kinda boring but superbly crafted
[2017-03-21 03:00:51 UTC] doctorzzz: moonlight was good tho
[2017-03-21 03:00:58 UTC] yacherdy: You guys fans of Kubrick?
[2017-03-21 03:01:03 UTC] therealkingghidorah: @neobornbloodmoonspartan9 what really sets the film apart is the action and cinematography very stylized paying homage to Apocalypse Now and yet the atmosphere fells similar to a Miyazaki film
[2017-03-21 03:02:27 UTC] doctorzzz: my fav film last year was probably hacksaw ridge
[2017-03-21 03:02:28 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: That's cool man, yeah ill consider watching it for sure.
[2017-03-21 03:02:31 UTC] doctorzzz: that one was really good
[2017-03-21 03:02:57 UTC] yacherdy: 2001? Shining? FMJ? Clockwork?
[2017-03-21 03:03:00 UTC] doctorzzz: the action scenes are outstanding
[2017-03-21 03:03:05 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Oh yeah, I saw some clips from that, haven't seen it all. Lala land had an interesting story honestly.
[2017-03-21 03:03:32 UTC] therealkingghidorah: FMJ always felt like two movies in one
[2017-03-21 03:03:56 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah but I personally think the second is also great...just not as good as the first half.
[2017-03-21 03:04:12 UTC] doctorzzz: didnt like fmj
[2017-03-21 03:04:17 UTC] doctorzzz: clockwork is good tho
[2017-03-21 03:04:27 UTC] doctorzzz: i like scorscese more
[2017-03-21 03:04:30 UTC] yacherdy: Oh can't forget Strangelove and Paths of Glory
[2017-03-21 03:05:00 UTC] therealkingghidorah: anyone been watching Samurai Jack?
[2017-03-21 03:05:06 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: I like Scorsese style and Tarintino's
[2017-03-21 03:05:07 UTC] doctorzzz: naw
[2017-03-21 03:05:37 UTC] yacherdy: No but I've heard people going on about it.
[2017-03-21 03:05:52 UTC] therealkingghidorah: shit got real last episode

[2017-03-21 03:06:57 UTC] doctorzzz: is iron fist out yet on netflix ?
[2017-03-21 03:07:09 UTC] therealkingghidorah: It's the final season of a series that "ended" in 2004 and its Sci-Fi action
[2017-03-21 03:07:33 UTC] yacherdy: Ended in 2004? RlyTho
[2017-03-21 03:09:05 UTC] therealkingghidorah: It ran on Cartoon Network from 2001-2004 for 4 seasons then the creator wanted a feature length finale. He couldn't get it so now we have a tv-14 finale season on Adult Swim
[2017-03-21 03:09:14 UTC] yacherdy: ahhh
[2017-03-21 03:09:51 UTC] therealkingghidorah: for its time it was really intense and graphic for a kids show
[2017-03-21 03:10:06 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Not really
[2017-03-21 03:10:16 UTC] yacherdy: I swear it sounds familiar...I must have come across it way back then
[2017-03-21 03:10:27 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: oh wait the new season you mean lol, maybe, I haven't seen it yet.
[2017-03-21 03:10:44 UTC] doctorzzz: i dont know i really not that into animu
[2017-03-21 03:10:52 UTC] yacherdy: me either

[2017-03-21 03:10:58 UTC] yacherdy: but I'm always interested
[2017-03-21 03:10:59 UTC] therealkingghidorah: @neobornbloodmoonspartan9 if you were to replace all the oil in the old show with blood then yes
[2017-03-21 03:11:11 UTC] doctorzzz: only i realyl watch was sailor moon, dbz and attack on titan
[2017-03-21 03:11:15 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: I mean, they're robots...
[2017-03-21 03:11:48 UTC] yacherdy: I watched Sailor Moon back in the mid to late 90's
[2017-03-21 03:12:00 UTC] yacherdy: that was about it. Lame I know. Sometimes I wish I would have watched more.

[2017-03-21 03:15:12 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Dragon ball still going on, jesus.
[2017-03-21 03:15:13 UTC] bobbi_ling: hunter x hunter top tier
[2017-03-21 03:15:26 UTC] burnout26: This season in anime for spring is some very hyped shows. aka AoT S2 and Hero Academia S2
[2017-03-21 03:15:42 UTC] doctorzzz: its pretty good, even tho the current dragon ball arc is kinda stupid
[2017-03-21 03:16:05 UTC] therealkingghidorah: you don't like the survival ark
[2017-03-21 03:16:07 UTC] bobbi_ling: whos the big bad in dragon ball these days?
[2017-03-21 03:16:10 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: I remember that when I was 8 I watch dbz, quit when I was 12 because it felt like it dragged on, same with Naruto. OpieOP
[2017-03-21 03:16:22 UTC] doctorzzz: i really liked the black arc tho
[2017-03-21 03:16:22 UTC] yacherdy: no chill even as a young man

[2017-03-21 03:18:01 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: i feel like all these animes drag on too long... only ones i ever watched from beginning to end were Gundam Wing X, yu yu Hakosho, and The Legend of the Galactic Heroes.
[2017-03-21 03:18:11 UTC] burnout26: Shippuden too much filler
[2017-03-21 03:18:24 UTC] doctorzzz: well if they use the 10 from the intro for universe 7 its gonna be really strange

[2017-03-21 03:18:33 UTC] yacherdy: no chill

[2017-03-21 05:24:35 UTC] sddaros: so far the only new things are things we never really asked for lol
[2017-03-21 05:24:35 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I got used to the cover system
[2017-03-21 05:24:50 UTC] johnlovesgaming: @Tyholmes12, but that's how the game works now, with thrusting and jump jets.
[2017-03-21 05:24:52 UTC] howlinthedeep: BabyRage different cover system grow up guys
[2017-03-21 05:25:03 UTC] bobbi_ling: Kieran ryder
[2017-03-21 05:25:06 UTC] lvlpower: @kristiannox fine thanks for asking
[2017-03-21 05:25:19 UTC] amplifyed: you're dumb, has nothing to do with it being different and people crying- it doesn't even work as it should
[2017-03-21 05:25:22 UTC] betheboom: Bobbi Ryder
[2017-03-21 05:25:23 UTC] aroundz: is there a button to press to snap to cover or do i just walk up to something and it just goes to cover
[2017-03-21 05:25:23 UTC] amplifyed: why would people not complain
[2017-03-21 05:25:25 UTC] johnlovesgaming: "grow up guys", it's a legitimate criticism LUL
[2017-03-21 05:25:28 UTC] darksteel78: I'm sure with time you get used to the new cover though. I wonder what made them change from the original series....
[2017-03-21 05:25:34 UTC] rocthaice24: Miss the old cover system already
[2017-03-21 05:25:39 UTC] darthvidarviking: Kerian_Bobbi
[2017-03-21 05:25:49 UTC] kristiannox: dies the sister ryder look sexy or just default
[2017-03-21 05:25:52 UTC] amplifyed: you're probably a Biotard who defends everything ever done by the company and will make this game their 10/10 goty
[2017-03-21 05:25:54 UTC] betheboom: vidar no
[2017-03-21 05:25:56 UTC] amplifyed: real logical coment

[2017-03-21 05:26:01 UTC] sardarkh: Combat skills are so dull in Adnromeda
[2017-03-21 05:26:03 UTC] darksteel78: A different dev team made this game, right? That could be why there's so many changes.
[2017-03-21 05:26:05 UTC] betheboom: bobbi NO
[2017-03-21 05:26:14 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @howlithedeep honestly after 3 MEs and over 200 hours on ME3 multiplayer its really nerve racking to not have a cover from the previous games.
[2017-03-21 05:26:14 UTC] darthvidarviking: bobbi_Kerian
[2017-03-21 05:26:17 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Mostly a new team with some trilogy lead designers
[2017-03-21 05:26:20 UTC] johnlovesgaming: @darksteel78, Yeah, it's no longer the former Bioware team
[2017-03-21 05:26:23 UTC] howlinthedeep: Bobbi_Allen
[2017-03-21 05:26:26 UTC] betheboom: vidar dont ship me and bobbi
[2017-03-21 05:26:26 UTC] howlinthedeep: lol
[2017-03-21 05:26:27 UTC] amplifyed: @darksteel78, different? no- just happens that basically EVERYONE left Bioware by now that worked on the original series
[2017-03-21 05:26:33 UTC] betheboom: deep caaaahmaaaaan
[2017-03-21 05:26:36 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Not a surprise, people quit jobs
[2017-03-21 05:26:46 UTC] howlinthedeep: sorry

[2017-03-21 05:26:58 UTC] betheboom: my surname
[2017-03-21 05:27:02 UTC] amplifyed: so it goes to their now quality shit tier deefault team since the talent left
[2017-03-21 05:27:03 UTC] royal_phalanx91: The Halo 4 writer wrote this game
[2017-03-21 05:27:13 UTC] amplifyed: like how "infinity ward" isn't even the same cmpqany anymore
[2017-03-21 05:27:16 UTC] darksteel78: Yeah. Game and tech industry attrition is rough. I've been working 6 months in Silicon Valley and I've been at my company longer than 30% of the employees.
[2017-03-21 05:27:23 UTC] amplifyed: companyt*
[2017-03-21 05:27:26 UTC] amplifyed: -t
[2017-03-21 05:27:33 UTC] bobbi_ling: how does deep know your surname?
[2017-03-21 05:27:37 UTC] royal_phalanx91: That's why a good tech company will train up new devs
[2017-03-21 05:27:43 UTC] howlinthedeep: hes said it before bobbi
[2017-03-21 05:27:47 UTC] aroundz: feel bad for the new team behind the game...they had large shoes to fill
[2017-03-21 05:27:53 UTC] omegazeda_1984: incinerate and lance is really good combo
[2017-03-21 05:28:01 UTC] codenameone: When Bioware took Karpyshyn off lead writer for ME3 and Casey Hudson left, the series was put in a coffin.
[2017-03-21 05:28:02 UTC] darthvidarviking: haha ok now I get it @howlingthedeep
[2017-03-21 05:28:05 UTC] lvlpower: @darksydephil dspSurpriseddsp use the force
[2017-03-21 05:28:07 UTC] amplifyed: I don't envy them, but I don't feel bad. Fucking do a better job
[2017-03-21 05:28:08 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Imagine just starting your new job and being told you have to make a AAA mass effect title
[2017-03-21 05:28:10 UTC] rocthaice24: Phil did you watch Raw?
[2017-03-21 05:28:13 UTC] amplifyed: its like 343 taking on Halo
[2017-03-21 05:28:26 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Liam TriHard i like Liam, he's the badass that will kill everything and cover your back TriHard
[2017-03-21 05:28:27 UTC] johnlovesgaming: No power wheel in this game too FeelsBadMan
[2017-03-21 05:28:34 UTC] royal_phalanx91: supposedly this game had a LOT of problems during development
[2017-03-21 05:28:49 UTC] royal_phalanx91: tons of devs quit
[2017-03-21 05:28:50 UTC] bobbi_ling: is this the "boring" planet everyone hates?
[2017-03-21 05:28:51 UTC] amplifyed: 3 abilities at a time and thats it...
[2017-03-21 05:28:55 UTC] darksteel78: Maybe like 343, they'll get it together in a game or two.
[2017-03-21 05:29:03 UTC] budoka79: awe
[2017-03-21 05:29:09 UTC] johnlovesgaming: @Bobbi_Ling, No, Eos is the boring planet that everyone hates.
[2017-03-21 05:29:15 UTC] 0megaj0ker: why does the conversation always interrupt early?
[2017-03-21 05:29:20 UTC] tigerpowered: Yo Phil,Whats up!
[2017-03-21 05:29:28 UTC] amplifyed: even though not EVERYONE hated Halo 5, its still not evenc lose to popular or memorable, or a must have by any standards
[2017-03-21 05:29:31 UTC] tigerpowered: whats up everyone
[2017-03-21 05:29:31 UTC] rocthaice24: Please don't let this game bomb out like Final Fantasy
[2017-03-21 05:29:41 UTC] codenameone: The alien shuttle looks virtually identical to the human shuttle.
[2017-03-21 05:29:43 UTC] darksteel78: ...did...did they just teleport through the floor of that drop ship?
[2017-03-21 05:29:44 UTC] royal_phalanx91: this game bombed on metacritic
[2017-03-21 05:29:50 UTC] johnlovesgaming: It's unfortunate that you can't use your squad's powers in this game
[2017-03-21 05:30:01 UTC] jelsea1973: There is a Very Rare sniper riffle on this planet make sure you look for caves Phil.
[2017-03-21 05:30:02 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Yep
[2017-03-21 05:30:02 UTC] tormentedmayhem17: Grenade L1 + R1?
[2017-03-21 05:30:02 UTC] hapticbabyman: @Royal_Phalanx91 Yep. Tons of drama behind-the-scenes. Only reason game came out roughly on-schedule and not cancelled is b/c it's ME. Most other games w/ lesser brand power would've been canned
[2017-03-21 05:30:09 UTC] amplifyed: final fantasy is a far better game than this and I've only played about 6 hours of it
[2017-03-21 05:30:09 UTC] bobbi_ling: 73 on metacritic i think
[2017-03-21 05:30:11 UTC] johnlovesgaming: No power wheel FeelsBadMan, but they have a weapon wheel Kappa
[2017-03-21 05:30:25 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Supposedly the remaining devs got tons of overtime to make it on time
[2017-03-21 05:30:34 UTC] doctorzzz: LUL

[2017-03-21 05:30:48 UTC] miss_kelcher: Final Fantasy actually has comedy and an interesting story, so ya
[2017-03-21 05:30:49 UTC] codenameone: They did warn you about cloaked enemies.
[2017-03-21 05:30:49 UTC] johnlovesgaming: These are the psuedo varren
[2017-03-21 05:30:53 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: FrankerZ
[2017-03-21 05:30:59 UTC] johnlovesgaming: that can cloak FeelsBadMan
[2017-03-21 05:31:01 UTC] physicalmemory: wait you can't pause combat and control what abilites your squad uses anymore?
[2017-03-21 05:31:05 UTC] howlinthedeep: theres already reviews? Well they sure haven't played the superior version of the ps4
[2017-03-21 05:31:06 UTC] royal_phalanx91: They are the space doges
[2017-03-21 05:31:06 UTC] lvlpower: surprise Phil wasn't dead
[2017-03-21 05:31:09 UTC] jamiepaulbaldwin: cheer100 This game needs more armpit hair
[2017-03-21 05:31:15 UTC] nolbert87: @JohnLovesGaming my thoughts as well
[2017-03-21 05:31:18 UTC] hapticbabyman: I doubt they got paid for the overtime, too.
[2017-03-21 05:31:19 UTC] whidex: PogChamp PogChamp
[2017-03-21 05:31:24 UTC] amplifyed: they removed the ability to pause entirely, so no more than 3 abilities at once or ordering squad what to do LUL

[2017-03-21 05:31:55 UTC] aroundz: switching to other favorite class has a cooldown on all the abilities, that kinda sucked but i guess it was for balancing

[2017-03-21 05:32:00 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Ded

[2017-03-21 05:32:25 UTC] amplifyed: but you're using biotics too....
[2017-03-21 05:32:28 UTC] darksteel78: Didn't realize this game had so many famous actors/actresses in side roles. Not that surprising given the hype.
[2017-03-21 05:32:29 UTC] amplifyed: you couldn't of done that?
[2017-03-21 05:32:30 UTC] rocthaice24: Jean Grey?
[2017-03-21 05:32:30 UTC] johnlovesgaming: You can't change your squad's armor or weapons... or even use their powers, and command them to what you want. And you have to switch "profiles" by pausing... ughhh vetoedW

[2017-03-21 05:57:54 UTC] spaghetti_factory: this game wasnt made by the oldschool bioware devs, no reason to feel like it has to be good

[2017-03-21 17:55:23 UTC] retrothicc2b: been watching wild force all morning
[2017-03-21 17:55:30 UTC] ufccurbstomp: wild force?

[2017-03-21 17:56:10 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Why are you watching Power Rangers?
[2017-03-21 17:56:21 UTC] retrothicc2b: cuz i was born 87
[2017-03-21 17:56:52 UTC] shega_ace: Part 7 was the final part from yesterdays session right?
[2017-03-21 17:57:00 UTC] ufccurbstomp: I was born 86. That doesn't mean I want to cringe every 10 seconds
[2017-03-21 17:57:05 UTC] capstonegaming: ^^^
[2017-03-21 17:57:11 UTC] retrothicc2b: well i had childhood

[2017-03-21 17:57:36 UTC] retrothicc2b: well I was part of the original power ranger wave.
[2017-03-21 17:57:42 UTC] capstonegaming: zordon isnt even a talking bongrip anymore they changed him
[2017-03-21 17:57:43 UTC] ufccurbstomp: You're talking to someone who's buying the Soul of Chogokin Megazord.
[2017-03-21 17:57:46 UTC] errnoent: Hey Phil you should go on some little runs around your neighborhood man. I used to work from home and it is really easy to get feeling shitty and it's almost magic how quickly it disappears when you do a little exercise each day.
[2017-03-21 17:57:53 UTC] capstonegaming: i was too i had the fighting game on the genesis
[2017-03-21 17:57:59 UTC] errnoent: Idk if you already do, just saying

[2017-03-21 17:58:54 UTC] ufccurbstomp: I wasn't telling him not to watch it. I'm just wondering how he can stomach it at his age - unless Power Rangers got less cheesy recently
[2017-03-21 17:59:35 UTC] yacherdy: Well me personally I grew up with Power Rangers. It admittedly I don't know much about this new movie.
[2017-03-21 17:59:36 UTC] retrothicc2b: well the disney era does suck a bit
[2017-03-21 17:59:42 UTC] ufccurbstomp: I prefer to keep Power Rangers as a childhood thing, cause I know for a fact it hasn't aged well.
[2017-03-21 17:59:42 UTC] capstonegaming: Toukiden 2 was okay. Japanese ppl need less dialogue in their text driven storylines

[2017-03-21 18:02:04 UTC] retrothicc2b: people will use it ALOT
[2017-03-21 18:02:10 UTC] ufccurbstomp: what would that emote even be though? Just the abbreviation?

[2017-03-21 18:02:38 UTC] popsicolo: You could make a face similar to the fap face, maybe Twitch will allow it if it's not directly from the incident.

[2017-03-21 18:02:46 UTC] yacherdy: @thenewfaceofcreation not too bad, yourself?

[2017-03-21 18:08:35 UTC] kruger25: There's been some reported screen tearing but it could just be twitch. Although they have increased their bit rate to 4K+
[2017-03-21 18:08:36 UTC] masternutella: So 970 runs fine with it correct?
[2017-03-21 18:08:39 UTC] capstonegaming: its because at the end of the game the real ending you only get if you never die once theyre all human like geth because geth assimlated all life in space

[2017-03-21 21:01:24 UTC] mammitri: @Bammbino, to fix animations and stuff, wouldn't you need to basically build the game from the ground up again though? Even assuming a patch could fix this is dumb

[2017-03-21 21:02:36 UTC] bammbino: @mammitri, i am 100% okay with mediocre animations so long as its on pointless NPCs.. this game has AWFUL animations on every single NPC including the main character

[2017-03-21 21:04:47 UTC] mammitri: @Bammbino, Fixing animations would take up too much while offering little in return for them, so the game will prob be like this forever as far as acting and animations go

[2017-03-21 21:41:40 UTC] howlinthedeep: They released a functional product last year in japan bammbino shouldn't have taken this long to get to the rest of the world
[2017-03-21 21:41:43 UTC] pcgamehunter: I think Phil likes having people reacting in real time, but he ends up just staring at the chat the whole time, which isn't something you want to watch on youtube ...

[2017-03-21 21:42:33 UTC] beanie5181: i mean working as a team is fine but trying to do it with strangers online is zzzz

[2017-03-21 21:43:34 UTC] wolfofthedawn: @Bammbino or when people are like your opinion is not my opinion so that factually makes it wrong Kappa
[2017-03-21 21:43:39 UTC] jlb8: it's weeaboo hell!

[2017-03-21 21:44:22 UTC] encelor: i bet japan already has el shaddai part 2
[2017-03-21 21:44:29 UTC] pcgamehunter: Localization is a pain i'd rather learn the language, it's a more permanent solution :P
[2017-03-21 21:44:35 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: big phil rage on that lnik

[2017-03-21 22:16:55 UTC] pcgamehunter: The thing is it's not like they animate it from that camera angle. So the animator had to be retarded or new not to see that mistake

[2017-03-21 22:26:27 UTC] pcgamehunter: Me3 didn't use Denuvo
[2017-03-21 22:26:46 UTC] pcgamehunter: Also Me3 mostly had texture mods
[2017-03-21 22:26:49 UTC] encelor: @pcgamehunter what is denuvo new engine?

[2017-03-21 22:27:07 UTC] capstonegaming: (crying red eyes)
[2017-03-21 22:27:12 UTC] pcgamehunter: Denuvo is a DRM system that most games are using, cause it makes it hard for pirates to crack it

It's way different w/ gameplay-driven games b/c the rage makes it more relatable and amusing
[2017-03-21 22:27:45 UTC] myfellowjohnson: Bioware should've outsourced the facial animations to Team Bondi. Too bad they shut down.
[2017-03-21 22:27:49 UTC] howlinthedeep: YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING
[2017-03-21 22:27:49 UTC] anondublo1: hot platforming mechanics
[2017-03-21 22:27:52 UTC] darthvidarviking: I would probably play it with PS3 controller anywayys if that is the case @BR_king
[2017-03-21 22:28:03 UTC] encelor: @pcgamehunter AH BUMMER i really wanted mods for andromeda for more character customization
[2017-03-21 22:28:03 UTC] xgameofpwns: Is this a cauldron?
[2017-03-21 22:28:14 UTC] pcgamehunter: It basically uses the game, pc and internet access to verify the game and make a PC specific code to play the game, which means modifications for the game would break it.
[2017-03-21 22:28:16 UTC] myfellowjohnson: Probably outsourced the damn writing too

[2017-03-21 22:30:40 UTC] myfellowjohnson: Surely, the technology from 2011 would be cheaper to do by now?

[2017-03-21 22:31:30 UTC] darthvidarviking: I don't know I think 2011 was like a revolutionary year for gaming. IT haven't improoved that much since
[2017-03-21 22:31:34 UTC] pcgamehunter: Actually it should be cheaper since LA noire was the first to use camera capture, which was since changed to motion capture since it's more usable and higher quality. Still shitty developers can't use good assets well
[2017-03-21 22:31:43 UTC] hapticbabyman: @MyFellowJohnson That doesn't mean much if the team isn't creative enough to use what's there. You don't need the absolute best tech to convey emotions in animation, just creative animators mostly.

[2017-03-21 22:32:23 UTC] jamesdiyonyoutube: thanks!
[2017-03-21 22:32:25 UTC] pcgamehunter: It's also possible the actors weren't taught properly and those twitchy faces are the faces of the actors lol
[2017-03-21 22:32:25 UTC] hapticbabyman: There are games from the '90s with more emotion in the character animations than this one; 2D games at that. So it's not always about tech.
[2017-03-21 22:32:41 UTC] dipchitt: the tech is shit too
[2017-03-21 22:33:01 UTC] ratchefan12: ok back for now lol

[2017-03-21 22:33:27 UTC] br_king: I don't remember the term for it but now more games are using a new method to capture things IRL and make them look amazing in games. Star Wars Battlefront did it and so did Battlefield 1.
[2017-03-21 22:33:30 UTC] superbatcat: my big toe shows more emotion than this game

[2017-03-21 22:34:58 UTC] br_king: @darthvidarviking I don't know about BF1 but I know Battlefront was a downgrade from Battlefront 2 in every way imaginable except the graphics.
