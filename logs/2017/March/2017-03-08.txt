[2017-03-08 19:16:07 UTC] splitplaythru: DSP, save your game frequently so you don't get cockblocked by an ending.

[2017-03-08 19:16:56 UTC] splitplaythru: In case you encounter one of joke endings, the game sends you back to last save point.

[2017-03-08 19:17:07 UTC] soulrider95: I'm hoping the PC version supports 120/144 fps
[2017-03-08 19:17:10 UTC] general_reginald: Nier Automata, the demo at least, is very fast and there's no block button, you dodge everything or you get hit.

[2017-03-08 19:17:27 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: 26 endings, damn they try too hard, almost as much as Shadow the Hedgehog endings TriHard
[2017-03-08 19:17:28 UTC] general_reginald: Theyre action rpgs

[2017-03-08 20:25:18 UTC] vince329: @outinz once you play it a lot, it actually is not, and adds interesting layers to the gameplay
[2017-03-08 20:25:19 UTC] outinz: @slurmdrinker thats right
[2017-03-08 20:25:27 UTC] marktactics: Yeah, I like how camera changes
[2017-03-08 20:25:28 UTC] drilbit777: Problem i with platnium games is that they reuse too many mechanics from bayonetta like witch time

[2017-03-08 21:45:59 UTC] bobbi_ling: 60fps in 2017? MingLee
[2017-03-08 21:46:01 UTC] terraenigmata: Phil said it's 60
[2017-03-08 21:46:01 UTC] vince329: @DarkDevilzWolf 60fps throughout

[2017-03-08 21:46:09 UTC] cainmasters: Ah
[2017-03-08 21:46:15 UTC] yacherdy: *Lucio does his laughing emote*
[2017-03-08 21:46:18 UTC] howlinthedeep: Only 60? Get with the times
[2017-03-08 21:46:22 UTC] encelor: 2017 jokes in 2017 MingLee
[2017-03-08 21:46:25 UTC] donchipotle: Thats a reference to the first Nier
[2017-03-08 21:46:30 UTC] vince329: hahaha... boars, because in the original NieR you could ride boars
[2017-03-08 21:46:30 UTC] cainmasters: No wonder the design is so bland
[2017-03-08 21:46:33 UTC] donchipotle: Where you could ride a huge boar as a mount
[2017-03-08 21:46:33 UTC] retrogarnet47: ride the animal V£
[2017-03-08 21:46:36 UTC] encelor: papa nier riding big boar
[2017-03-08 21:46:51 UTC] bobbi_ling: horizon set the standard with 15fps MingLee
[2017-03-08 21:46:54 UTC] smward87: indeed. the art style and tone make up for the relatively sparse and unimpressive graphics @TerraEnigmata
[2017-03-08 21:47:20 UTC] yacherdy: Nani?
[2017-03-08 21:47:21 UTC] darkdevilzwolf: has he tried the upskirt camera easter egg yet?
[2017-03-08 21:47:21 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: dw, trump will make jobs.

[2017-03-08 21:47:31 UTC] cainmasters: Is she a robot??
[2017-03-08 21:47:37 UTC] vince329: @Cainmasters yes she's an android
[2017-03-08 21:47:37 UTC] howlinthedeep: Stop hating on horizon
[2017-03-08 21:47:42 UTC] donchipotle: She's an android
[2017-03-08 21:47:48 UTC] cainmasters: Thought so
[2017-03-08 21:47:51 UTC] ollyorange: so shes part human?
[2017-03-08 21:47:56 UTC] terraenigmata: True, though i can't blame it for the graphics much, there can be a lot going on at once and keeping 60 FPS may be more important than packing the world full of visual fluff
[2017-03-08 21:48:03 UTC] howlinthedeep: No she's not an android phone
[2017-03-08 21:48:03 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Meh, Horizon is ok. Just overhyped to the point it didn't live up to it.
[2017-03-08 21:48:04 UTC] yacherdy: She's a model and she's looking good
[2017-03-08 21:48:07 UTC] cainmasters: Which parts? Kappa
[2017-03-08 21:48:08 UTC] smward87: no, that's a cyborg. @ollyorange

[2017-03-08 21:48:20 UTC] deltaforce355: where is bethe btw?
[2017-03-08 21:48:20 UTC] smward87: androids are robots with AI and personalities
[2017-03-08 21:48:22 UTC] donchipotle: The 60 fps is important in this game because it's a fast paced action game
[2017-03-08 21:48:28 UTC] darkdevilzwolf: no thats a cyborg, shes an android
[2017-03-08 21:48:31 UTC] akioartorius: androids are more human looking than cyborgs
[2017-03-08 21:48:32 UTC] terraenigmata: exactly

[2017-03-08 21:49:11 UTC] insaiyan9000: this will get tedious quick lol...
[2017-03-08 21:49:11 UTC] howlinthedeep: They're in Paris after all
