[2017-03-26 03:10:15 UTC] damiennoctis: I think Nintendo said screw the timeline when they made this one lol
[2017-03-26 03:10:17 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: Some fans speculate it's a "soft reboot" of the Zelda universe because this game takes aspects from all 3 timelines
[2017-03-26 03:10:46 UTC] derichloveslemur: Do you remember the last time you saw a korok?
[2017-03-26 03:11:04 UTC] milkyway941: Come on down SmugShrug
[2017-03-26 03:11:05 UTC] gilgameshxsaber: I know every game its supposed to be a new link but its the same ganon right? so how is he beaten everytime?
[2017-03-26 03:11:11 UTC] mdblz: So lame
[2017-03-26 03:11:44 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil, Once you get your 4 spirit orb will you do stamina or hearts?
[2017-03-26 03:11:58 UTC] damiennoctis: I guess Ganon never learns from experience.
[2017-03-26 03:12:00 UTC] dragonjarvis: there are also islands east you could check out

[2017-03-26 03:17:26 UTC] miss_kelcher: wow, good job ^^
[2017-03-26 03:17:36 UTC] dreamergalaxius: because Stasis don't work that good on them
[2017-03-26 03:17:42 UTC] dragonjarvis: the red lynel is a push over, you should fight the white ones :D
[2017-03-26 03:17:48 UTC] damiennoctis: lol accidental bonfire

[2017-03-26 03:24:14 UTC] damiennoctis: Great game
[2017-03-26 03:24:19 UTC] toooldforgaming: Is there something wrong with Phil? The black lines under his eyes, excessive blinking and the repeated narrowing of the bridge of his nose. Typically that dictates massive fatigue
[2017-03-26 03:24:23 UTC] somefatguysarm: Do you like a strong female Phil?
[2017-03-26 03:24:24 UTC] allntzz: The got smashed and made into a big omlet

[2017-03-26 03:27:02 UTC] butter__my__bread: No
[2017-03-26 03:27:08 UTC] damiennoctis: Nope
[2017-03-26 03:27:10 UTC] howlinthedeep: don't get the switch
[2017-03-26 03:27:13 UTC] howlinthedeep: it's not worth it
[2017-03-26 03:27:14 UTC] butter__my__bread: just watch someone play it
[2017-03-26 03:27:14 UTC] saintanti: @saiyanslayer69, buy it on wii u
[2017-03-26 03:27:17 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @saiyanslayer69 AHHHAHAHAHAH, no.

[2017-03-26 03:27:31 UTC] cm0n3ymillionair: based off satoru iwata
[2017-03-26 03:27:32 UTC] howlinthedeep: If you get the switch it might not even work lol
[2017-03-26 03:27:34 UTC] saiyanslayer69: I heard PC already emulated the entire game already lmao
[2017-03-26 03:27:35 UTC] miss_kelcher: Breath of The Wild is just as good on the Wii U
[2017-03-26 03:27:36 UTC] kushiyakitori: @Popsicolo, yeah those last few mniutes were pretty damn good
[2017-03-26 03:27:40 UTC] popsicolo: DoritosChip Village
[2017-03-26 03:28:04 UTC] howlinthedeep: @DarksydePhil you must achieve satori first
[2017-03-26 03:28:11 UTC] damiennoctis: Really? Does the PC emulator get rid of the lag? lol
[2017-03-26 03:28:26 UTC] mdblz: Secret horse
[2017-03-26 03:28:28 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @saiyanslayer69 if Nintendo are making future Nintendo games exclusively for the Switch then buy it
[2017-03-26 03:28:32 UTC] gargos15: Satoru Mountain
[2017-03-26 03:28:33 UTC] cm0n3ymillionair: yup mountain that glows with the glowing horse
[2017-03-26 03:28:34 UTC] kushiyakitori: The cemu emulation of the game has a lot of room to improve
[2017-03-26 03:28:41 UTC] saintanti: The easter egg only appears at rare times
[2017-03-26 03:28:55 UTC] damiennoctis: Ah, I figured, they usually take a number of years to be playable
[2017-03-26 03:29:22 UTC] kushiyakitori: Probably wont take years but months.
[2017-03-26 03:29:25 UTC] howlinthedeep: Satori is a buddhist term for sudden enlightenment. It was a joke :)
[2017-03-26 03:29:35 UTC] nolbert87: ^
[2017-03-26 03:29:43 UTC] nukacolaking: I've been playing this since launch and only just beat the 2nd beast
[2017-03-26 03:29:44 UTC] toooldforgaming: Switch is actually underpriced considering what is inside it
[2017-03-26 03:29:45 UTC] damiennoctis: Man, that'd be awesome. I'm hoping they get it working well soon.
[2017-03-26 03:29:51 UTC] nukacolaking: and got the master sword
[2017-03-26 03:30:15 UTC] toooldforgaming: It's under priced tablet hardware alone by $100, and that only grows with all the addons etc
[2017-03-26 03:30:18 UTC] kushiyakitori: your mini map has a compass
[2017-03-26 03:30:19 UTC] nolbert87: @TooOldForGaming yeah but its still underpowered
[2017-03-26 03:30:31 UTC] damiennoctis: Must be hidden behind the mountains
[2017-03-26 03:30:38 UTC] cm0n3ymillionair: i believe its behind the mountain
[2017-03-26 03:30:42 UTC] thechraistx: ZELDA AGAIN ResidentSleeper
[2017-03-26 03:30:42 UTC] howlinthedeep: Lol it doesn't help that Phil is doing this in the dark
[2017-03-26 03:30:46 UTC] toooldforgaming: Technically the Switch tablet has multiple modes
[2017-03-26 03:30:56 UTC] damiennoctis: Maybe travel to that mountain and look down?
[2017-03-26 03:30:58 UTC] toooldforgaming: And you can go full speed, but it's doubtful anybody will do it
[2017-03-26 03:31:19 UTC] toooldforgaming: Most of them will either run it at 40% mode or 70% mode
[2017-03-26 03:31:55 UTC] howlinthedeep: Skeletons trigger Phil again
[2017-03-26 03:32:01 UTC] stebeian: KKona
[2017-03-26 03:32:13 UTC] damiennoctis: I'm still surprised that the Switch docked is supposed to have issues running some parts of the game
[2017-03-26 03:32:31 UTC] damiennoctis: that's just completely unexcusable in my opinion.
[2017-03-26 03:32:41 UTC] toooldforgaming: Well it's 70% power of a Tegra X1
[2017-03-26 03:32:49 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @nukacolaking You have other things to do apparently. its better to play adventure games slowly than quickly go through it, feels better I think.
[2017-03-26 03:32:55 UTC] allntzz: hei skeletons or not at least there arent any flanking kett here.... Kappa
[2017-03-26 03:33:24 UTC] howlinthedeep: Phil needs a pair of balls Kappa
[2017-03-26 03:33:27 UTC] nolbert87: 3 balls 2 strikes no runner on base
[2017-03-26 03:33:31 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @DarksydePhil Krogans have 4 balls RitzMitz

[2017-03-26 03:36:13 UTC] pmasterofman: dsp what are your thoughts on the switch so far?
[2017-03-26 03:36:16 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @Popsicolo its no wonder the salerians sought to infertilize them, those frogs are fucking all day and still have testosterone left over to kill things and workout RitzMitz
[2017-03-26 03:36:28 UTC] encelor: @pmasterofman he think it shit
[2017-03-26 03:36:29 UTC] dragonjarvis: framerate on switch is better but not perfect
[2017-03-26 03:36:32 UTC] dreamergalaxius: @darksydephil shot them in the Eye
[2017-03-26 03:36:41 UTC] nolbert87: @pmasterofman he's playing this on wii u

[2017-03-26 03:36:46 UTC] tazdevilz1986: 30 ?
[2017-03-26 03:36:50 UTC] damiennoctis: Framerate is better when undocked and running at 720
[2017-03-26 03:36:54 UTC] nolbert87: @DragonJarvis thanks
[2017-03-26 03:37:11 UTC] popsicolo: @neobornbloodmoonspartan9 Nerds truly are the new bullies
[2017-03-26 03:37:13 UTC] howlinthedeep: a bunch of toenails
[2017-03-26 03:37:15 UTC] nolbert87: @DamienNoctis how do you unlock it?
[2017-03-26 03:37:18 UTC] dreamergalaxius: @damiennoctis he plays on Wii U
[2017-03-26 03:37:35 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @Popsicolo NotATK
[2017-03-26 03:37:36 UTC] howlinthedeep: yeah his switch bricked
[2017-03-26 03:37:36 UTC] damiennoctis: not, unlocked, undocked
[2017-03-26 03:37:41 UTC] damiennoctis: as in portable mode
[2017-03-26 03:37:43 UTC] howlinthedeep: so he's just using his wii u
[2017-03-26 03:37:47 UTC] kushiyakitori: it probably rolled
[2017-03-26 03:37:58 UTC] dragonjarvis: phil when you run around in stasis mode you can see certain things easier
[2017-03-26 03:38:05 UTC] tazdevilz1986: alot of people have broken switches
[2017-03-26 03:38:13 UTC] nolbert87: @DamienNoctis ahh...thats weird
[2017-03-26 03:38:18 UTC] dreamergalaxius: @darksydephil shoot them in the eye
[2017-03-26 03:38:27 UTC] allntzz: i actually spent some hours on the wiki mass effect and the krogans are the most dangerous race except Reapers....they reproduced before the F-ing sterilizing plage like 1000 egg nests or smth
[2017-03-26 03:38:38 UTC] bloodborne2day: do you think there will be a zelda/switch bundle this fall
[2017-03-26 03:38:39 UTC] damiennoctis: Yeah, in docked mode it ups the resolution to 900p, and I guess it can't handle it.
[2017-03-26 03:38:42 UTC] howlinthedeep: A console made in 2017 should be able to do 1080p 60fps no problem in their games
[2017-03-26 03:38:50 UTC] howlinthedeep: but noooo not the switch
[2017-03-26 03:38:51 UTC] allntzz: thats crazy they are by far the most potent race

[2017-03-26 03:39:11 UTC] popsicolo: Krogan Kock-jobs WutFace
[2017-03-26 03:39:11 UTC] dreamergalaxius: the switch is a handheld, not a console
[2017-03-26 03:39:19 UTC] dreamergalaxius: don't forget that
[2017-03-26 03:39:22 UTC] damiennoctis: Pretty much yeah
[2017-03-26 03:39:26 UTC] kushiyakitori: Should take a picture of him for easier tracking of hinox
[2017-03-26 03:39:35 UTC] nolbert87: @kongkaiju welcome
[2017-03-26 03:39:36 UTC] damiennoctis: They were smart enough to finally include an hdmi out
[2017-03-26 03:39:38 UTC] howlinthedeep: So the switch is a fancy version of a gameboy lol
[2017-03-26 03:39:46 UTC] tazdevilz1986: Switch has no achievements
[2017-03-26 03:40:00 UTC] popsicolo: Switch has no games MingLee
[2017-03-26 03:40:17 UTC] tazdevilz1986: No games no achievements = no buy
[2017-03-26 03:40:20 UTC] howlinthedeep: it has 1 2 switch pops
[2017-03-26 03:40:33 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil I'm gonna head to bed! I'll be here for Overwatch tomorrow for Orisa and BVA!
[2017-03-26 03:40:35 UTC] damiennoctis: That Hinox was a joke
[2017-03-26 03:40:42 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @Popsicolo so you switch to another console EleGiggle
[2017-03-26 03:41:01 UTC] popsicolo: Ah yes, cow milking simulator. How could I forget? KappaHD
[2017-03-26 03:41:01 UTC] dragonjarvis: it has zelda and a couple of decend indie games but yeah initial launch lineup of the switch could have been better
[2017-03-26 03:41:11 UTC] toooldforgaming: Looks pathetically easy, bet you can beat him like Ocarina of Time Ganon and just run between his legs and smack him in the ass
[2017-03-26 03:41:12 UTC] derichloveslemur: goodnight guys!
[2017-03-26 03:41:34 UTC] damiennoctis: wow, overkill lol

[2017-03-26 03:42:09 UTC] dragonjarvis: I wont buy a switch this year either. I wait until mario and a couple of 3rd party games come out
[2017-03-26 03:42:11 UTC] howlinthedeep: If zelda didn't come out on release day noone would buy a switch
[2017-03-26 03:42:12 UTC] nolbert87: never even played Xeno 1
[2017-03-26 03:42:14 UTC] dreamergalaxius: there will probably be a Switch Pro Version or something
[2017-03-26 03:42:14 UTC] toooldforgaming: God this game is so empty

[2017-03-26 03:42:19 UTC] dreamergalaxius: in 1-2 years
[2017-03-26 03:42:19 UTC] damiennoctis: Smart to wait for more games and a price drop
[2017-03-26 03:42:41 UTC] allntzz: bugged cheering ...mechanics?
[2017-03-26 03:42:43 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: Typical open world game, lots of empty space
[2017-03-26 03:42:58 UTC] toooldforgaming: At least Skyrim has stuff attacking you all the time
[2017-03-26 03:42:58 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: Actually, I should specify... typical "post-apocalyptic" open world game
[2017-03-26 03:43:02 UTC] popsicolo: I hear there's a character in this game that looks like Robin Williams.
[2017-03-26 03:43:06 UTC] tazdevilz1986: Im staying with my ps4 and xbox one not need the switch.
[2017-03-26 03:43:08 UTC] derichloveslemur: I actually might be able to stay for a bit longer probably.
[2017-03-26 03:43:18 UTC] damiennoctis: Do you guys think they'll stick with the extremely large open world format for the next Zelda game?
[2017-03-26 03:43:19 UTC] derichloveslemur: before I call it for tonight.
[2017-03-26 03:43:20 UTC] dragonjarvis: lots of empty space? you can litteraly find stuff under every single rock lol
[2017-03-26 03:43:22 UTC] dreamergalaxius: @kevindeleonisscum it's still not typicall
[2017-03-26 03:43:37 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil How many Hinox's have you fought?
[2017-03-26 03:43:44 UTC] dreamergalaxius: it's far away from typicall Open World Games
[2017-03-26 03:43:45 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: This is the 3rd one
[2017-03-26 03:43:55 UTC] bloodborne2day: this boss is harder than the Fume knight
[2017-03-26 03:44:00 UTC] dreamergalaxius: because it does not hold your hand
[2017-03-26 03:44:02 UTC] toooldforgaming: There's a character that looks exactly like Iwata and Robin Williams
[2017-03-26 03:44:08 UTC] toooldforgaming: Did he just use my strat?
[2017-03-26 03:44:29 UTC] derichloveslemur: There sure is a lot of hinox's in this area right @DarksydePhil lol
[2017-03-26 03:44:34 UTC] dragonjarvis: mipha is my fish waifu
[2017-03-26 03:44:34 UTC] toooldforgaming: "Where's my wave?!"
[2017-03-26 03:44:46 UTC] dreamergalaxius: and yeah, it mostly looks empty for many players, because they don't pay much attention to their surroundings
[2017-03-26 03:44:59 UTC] dreamergalaxius: there really is hidden stuff everywhere
[2017-03-26 03:45:05 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @Popsicolo I miss Robin Williams, feelsbadman
[2017-03-26 03:45:06 UTC] derichloveslemur: its hi-nox
[2017-03-26 03:45:15 UTC] damiennoctis: I guess it depends on if you find collecting korok seeds interesting
[2017-03-26 03:45:18 UTC] popsicolo: Zoras are based on sharks, so the males probably have two cocks.
[2017-03-26 03:45:19 UTC] derichloveslemur: What area is this called?
[2017-03-26 03:45:28 UTC] allntzz: not hey-nox? :D

[2017-03-26 04:38:57 UTC] bammbino: 100$ is better than monitor speakers
[2017-03-26 04:39:08 UTC] popsicolo: As Forrest Gump once said "You never know what you're gonna get"
[2017-03-26 04:39:10 UTC] yacherdy: @Bammbino yeah, true
[2017-03-26 04:39:15 UTC] darthvidarviking: do you have like bad hearing or something ? :P
[2017-03-26 04:39:19 UTC] bammbino: didnt know you posted stuff like that, first time clicking
[2017-03-26 04:39:32 UTC] yacherdy: Pops is into that type of stuff.
[2017-03-26 04:39:32 UTC] bammbino: i hate clicking links in this chat thanks to a very special mod
[2017-03-26 04:39:52 UTC] yacherdy: Wonder if that mod rhymes with vino
[2017-03-26 04:39:57 UTC] popsicolo: Not usually. Just because we're post-stream
[2017-03-26 04:40:09 UTC] yacherdy: @Popsicolo Kappa
[2017-03-26 04:40:11 UTC] bammbino: @darthvidarviking, i have good hearing, i hate poor audio quality
[2017-03-26 04:40:30 UTC] popsicolo: BTTV saves me my Gino's Rick-Rolling
[2017-03-26 04:40:30 UTC] bammbino: the difference between monitor speakers and surround sound is up there
[2017-03-26 04:40:42 UTC] darthvidarviking: I undersatnd to make it more clear i shoudl have written @Popsicolo
[2017-03-26 04:40:48 UTC] yacherdy: Exactly..thats why its killing me to use these iphone earbuds...my headphones broke
[2017-03-26 04:40:52 UTC] manyperegrine81: So how was Phil's Steam today? Any Positivity?
[2017-03-26 04:41:08 UTC] darthvidarviking: He is the one with the lou audio lol
[2017-03-26 04:41:12 UTC] bammbino: the ME:A stream was nothing but positivity! LMFAO
[2017-03-26 04:41:15 UTC] yacherdy: Apparently not with his Mass Effect stream but Zelda seemed fine
[2017-03-26 04:41:21 UTC] bammbino: saved chat alot of money on the game
[2017-03-26 04:41:26 UTC] popsicolo: It's important to hear Lucio scream at the top of his lungs in high fidelity audio KappaHD
[2017-03-26 04:41:35 UTC] bammbino: i stil llike it even tho i wont touch SP til they fix shit
[2017-03-26 04:41:36 UTC] yacherdy: True Pops
[2017-03-26 04:42:06 UTC] darthvidarviking: ;)
[2017-03-26 04:42:15 UTC] bammbino: someone get phil to talk to stream during the driving sessions in MEA
[2017-03-26 04:42:29 UTC] bammbino: its brutal to watch 10 min of driving to the next spot
[2017-03-26 04:42:41 UTC] yacherdy: He should tell stories that would've been on Hate Live or whatever during them
[2017-03-26 04:42:44 UTC] bammbino: (i dont blame him)
[2017-03-26 04:43:04 UTC] manyperegrine81: Speaking of Lucio. There was like YouTube Drama with ssSniperWolf and her piggybacking to the Top charts of Overwatch
[2017-03-26 04:43:06 UTC] yacherdy: or talk about past Mass Effect games
[2017-03-26 04:43:14 UTC] manyperegrine81: Apparently using Lucio.
[2017-03-26 04:43:15 UTC] bammbino: good idea yacherdy
[2017-03-26 04:43:34 UTC] bammbino: talking about what you loved in the old one gives context to why he hates the bad decisions in the game
[2017-03-26 04:43:39 UTC] yacherdy: lol 10/10 Lucio player
[2017-03-26 04:43:40 UTC] darthvidarviking: I don't understand why that car have like one horsepower and has no traction
[2017-03-26 04:43:53 UTC] darthvidarviking: IT's like they made it too be boring on pupose.
[2017-03-26 04:43:53 UTC] yacherdy: @Bammbino yeah something like that...
[2017-03-26 04:44:12 UTC] bammbino: LOL! cause they thought making an upgrade to unlock traction control button was a good idea ikn 2017
[2017-03-26 04:44:20 UTC] bammbino: you have to enable it then disable
[2017-03-26 04:44:22 UTC] yacherdy: I think the Nomad is fine...what caused him to rage?
[2017-03-26 04:44:35 UTC] bammbino: 10min+ driving from site to site
[2017-03-26 04:44:38 UTC] yacherdy: ah
[2017-03-26 04:45:00 UTC] bammbino: most RPGs have banter during travel
[2017-03-26 04:45:05 UTC] yacherdy: I find it relaxing but I can see why him streaming at the same time could be a problem.
[2017-03-26 04:45:06 UTC] bammbino: his crew doesnt say shit
[2017-03-26 04:45:21 UTC] yacherdy: plus its boring to watch as a viewer
[2017-03-26 04:45:43 UTC] bammbino: ya, and phil hasnt realized that music barely plays in exploration
[2017-03-26 04:45:55 UTC] bammbino: so all we hear is the nomad and him using boost and complaining
[2017-03-26 04:46:10 UTC] bammbino: not like when we saw him fight bosses and nioh and complain
[2017-03-26 04:46:16 UTC] bammbino: in nioh*
[2017-03-26 04:46:22 UTC] yacherdy: lol
[2017-03-26 04:46:39 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah I can see that
[2017-03-26 04:46:48 UTC] bammbino: is there no fast travel?
[2017-03-26 04:48:07 UTC] yacherdy: I thought there was
[2017-03-26 04:48:12 UTC] yacherdy: but I haven't used it yet
[2017-03-26 04:48:15 UTC] yacherdy: if so

[2017-03-26 17:49:38 UTC] n0_h3r0: @RandomRon005, Same bro I wanna play too lmao

[2017-03-26 17:50:19 UTC] ufccurbstomp: It's Overwatch today right?
[2017-03-26 17:50:19 UTC] burnout26: Orisa is decent still would rather play Zarya
[2017-03-26 17:50:21 UTC] n0_h3r0: *raises hand*

[2017-03-26 17:50:57 UTC] burnout26: sup lobosGoldBlank
[2017-03-26 17:51:00 UTC] n0_h3r0: Orisa seems like a double edged sword tbh. If she gets headshotted she dies in two seconds, but if she gets her headshots she melts you.
[2017-03-26 17:51:00 UTC] randomron005: I'm willing to play Mercy, again. That said, I'm changing again if I get PotG with her because we are NOT going back to Mercy POTG Madness like last time.
[2017-03-26 17:51:14 UTC] blue_blur64: LUL
[2017-03-26 17:51:21 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm gonna try to get POTG this time
[2017-03-26 17:51:38 UTC] n0_h3r0: I might get a POTG if im lucky.
[2017-03-26 17:51:45 UTC] blue_blur64: I did get one with Symmetra earlier today
[2017-03-26 17:52:07 UTC] randomron005: Anyone could get it with Symmetra, and this is coming from a Symmetra main.
[2017-03-26 17:52:31 UTC] n0_h3r0: I've haven't played Symmetra since the beta lol.
[2017-03-26 17:52:34 UTC] burnout26: I got a POTG with Hanzo and didnt even use his ultimate. Been lately trying to get better at him
[2017-03-26 17:52:34 UTC] ufccurbstomp: Should we get a McCree Death Counter ready? :P
[2017-03-26 17:52:36 UTC] renastella: what do you play, h3r0?
[2017-03-26 17:52:49 UTC] derichloveslemur: @blue_blur64 @burnout26 do you guys like Phils BVA?

[2017-03-26 17:53:39 UTC] renastella: @N0_H3R0 oh cool

[2017-03-26 17:54:51 UTC] randomron005: Because there's no downside with him.
[2017-03-26 17:55:01 UTC] n0_h3r0: @Popsicolo, I mean can I play on stream LMAO
[2017-03-26 17:55:03 UTC] blue_blur64: Pop, you're already a god with Junkrat Kappa
[2017-03-26 17:55:14 UTC] blue_blur64: I'm in too bethe
[2017-03-26 17:55:18 UTC] n0_h3r0: Pops, saint of all Junkrats
[2017-03-26 17:55:21 UTC] popsicolo: Ah, wasn't sure. That's up to Phil I think.
[2017-03-26 17:55:31 UTC] betheboom: i said you with pops silent :D
[2017-03-26 17:55:35 UTC] n0_h3r0: I sent him a message so hopefully he sees it

[2017-03-26 17:56:15 UTC] randomron005: It also just occurred to me this is Phil's first time playing it in a while, meaning he hasn't seen Bastion's new buff.
[2017-03-26 17:56:40 UTC] derichloveslemur: @betheboom you like BVA correct?
[2017-03-26 17:56:53 UTC] burnout26: yea dsp only plays when there is a new character or map
[2017-03-26 17:57:01 UTC] betheboom: watch pops, silent and no hero get 0 POTG today and phil gets some POTG :D
[2017-03-26 17:57:07 UTC] betheboom: derich yes i like her

[2017-03-26 17:57:33 UTC] randomron005: Last time I was there, it was Mercy POTG Madness.
[2017-03-26 17:57:37 UTC] popsicolo: I haven't played a lot lately, so I saw how they changed the Eichenwalde castle door for the first time.
[2017-03-26 17:57:56 UTC] simonrez: @Popsicolo That's not in the game yet
[2017-03-26 17:58:08 UTC] simonrez: Next patch
[2017-03-26 17:58:10 UTC] derichloveslemur: @Popsicolo What characters do you use? Do you use variety?
[2017-03-26 17:58:11 UTC] n0_h3r0: @Popsicolo, They're also adding another route to the point in the PTR I think.
[2017-03-26 17:58:15 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: Kurt Eichenwalde castle, no flashing gifs allowed
[2017-03-26 17:58:19 UTC] betheboom: pops your going to lose those overwatch skillz if your not careful :P
[2017-03-26 17:58:32 UTC] randomron005: The same patch that will make Lucio a better DPS than Sombra.
[2017-03-26 17:58:44 UTC] derichloveslemur: @KingOfHypocrisy Fan of BVA?
[2017-03-26 17:58:51 UTC] popsicolo: No SimonREZ I mean the castle door collapsing. I saw it the other day.

[2017-03-26 17:59:29 UTC] popsicolo: Lucio is now "Loud Lucio"

[2017-03-26 21:53:20 UTC] podusmonens: yeah
[2017-03-26 21:53:30 UTC] noflexzone22: The fact that you think the ps5 is coming out next year is funny. Plus Microsoft even stated that the Scorpio isn't a next gen console, only an upgraded Xbox one
[2017-03-26 21:53:42 UTC] derichloveslemur: Phil Remember HALT! when enemies are nearby you.

[2017-03-26 21:54:01 UTC] encelor: they should make console that can get upgraded instead of a whole new console
[2017-03-26 21:54:07 UTC] betheboom: jean-oh *DX chops*
[2017-03-26 21:54:11 UTC] zalenor: @encelor, lvl means play time and he he hasnt figure that yet,,,,

[2017-03-26 21:54:54 UTC] bammbino: @podusmonens, division devs have been hardcore nerfing PVE cause of PVP when it was marketed as a PVE game and they dont keep backtracking instead of making things right like diablo 3devs did to their game
[2017-03-26 21:55:03 UTC] noflexzone22: Yeah probably will get announced sometime in 2019 and release 2020

[2017-03-26 22:25:42 UTC] wolflink659: @bammbino I've been watching Phil since his April Fools video back in 2010-11. I never met him in person, but want to play with him atleast one match.
[2017-03-26 22:25:51 UTC] sam_scratch: the trolls are probably a sizeable percentage of the viewership if they left it would probably knock phil down the rankings in twitch
[2017-03-26 22:26:03 UTC] derichloveslemur: @DarksydePhil I know you guys can get this win! We believe!
