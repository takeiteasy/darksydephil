[2017-03-19 17:54:49 UTC] retrothicc2b: phil someone subed at 8 in the morn, lol
[2017-03-19 17:54:51 UTC] darksydephil: youtube still hasn't updated to tell me if it's made any money. the ads are definitely working though
[2017-03-19 17:55:26 UTC] howlinthedeep: hmmm...that's good i guess then
[2017-03-19 17:55:28 UTC] jackwhite2000: phil what are you gonna play sniper ghost warrior 3?
[2017-03-19 17:55:29 UTC] gammaion1: youtube has problems with updating information in general
[2017-03-19 17:55:38 UTC] jackwhite2000: are you*
[2017-03-19 17:55:40 UTC] gammaion1: it has problems updating notifications and such
[2017-03-19 17:56:03 UTC] darksydephil: i get the feeling something is wrong
[2017-03-19 17:56:06 UTC] darksydephil: but there's no way to get help
[2017-03-19 17:56:13 UTC] darksydephil: normal adsense partners have no help whatsoever
[2017-03-19 17:57:11 UTC] retrothicc2b: dspCowboy well, it
[2017-03-19 17:57:21 UTC] retrothicc2b: it's youtube what can u do*
[2017-03-19 17:57:26 UTC] gammaion1: so is phil near the end of BotW?
[2017-03-19 17:57:39 UTC] 0megaj0ker: nope
[2017-03-19 17:57:47 UTC] retrothicc2b: he has two regions to explore i think
[2017-03-19 17:57:51 UTC] jackwhite2000: @Gammaion1 more like barely halfway through
[2017-03-19 17:58:06 UTC] gammaion1: and that's what, 40 hours into the game? looks like it has an impressive amount of content
[2017-03-19 17:58:18 UTC] podusmonens: wazzup ya freaks
[2017-03-19 17:58:26 UTC] howlinthedeep: hiya dragin
[2017-03-19 17:58:35 UTC] eternia_forever: someone that i follow on youtube that does action figure reviews and has 90000 subs, was live stream video games last evening, and he had 12 fucking people watching out of 90000 subs 12, and he had been streaming gaming for some timeI tried to tell him that youtube sucked for live streaming games and to get his ass over on twitch..
[2017-03-19 17:59:19 UTC] howlinthedeep: hmmm eternia...maybe people only like him for the action figure reviews
[2017-03-19 17:59:30 UTC] jackwhite2000: wonder if BOTW will become phils longest playthrough ever
[2017-03-19 17:59:37 UTC] gammaion1: its attrition, most of those 90000 probably aren't very active, so only a few hardcore fans would seek out his content at any given time
[2017-03-19 17:59:38 UTC] podusmonens: hey deep
[2017-03-19 17:59:52 UTC] sanguinenite: I find Zelda overated as hell
[2017-03-19 18:00:01 UTC] podusmonens: omfg action figure reviews. why would you watch that shit
[2017-03-19 18:00:13 UTC] podusmonens: it's the most autistic shit I'v eheard of
[2017-03-19 18:00:19 UTC] jackwhite2000: but i think nothing will top the 75 hour long skyrim playthrough
[2017-03-19 18:00:19 UTC] retrothicc2b: lol
[2017-03-19 18:00:40 UTC] eternia_forever: no he gets very good views on his reviews not 90000 but good views non the less @Gammaion1
[2017-03-19 18:00:50 UTC] howlinthedeep: lol dragin just show pictures from multiple angles...what's there to talk about? the history of the figures?
[2017-03-19 18:01:00 UTC] gammaion1: "they're not action figures! they're models!"
[2017-03-19 18:01:12 UTC] eternia_forever: yeah i was thinking that but only 12 people wow @HowlintheDeep
[2017-03-19 18:01:23 UTC] gammaion1: yeah, but keep in mind that live streaming is during a certain time period, so not everyone is active
[2017-03-19 18:01:33 UTC] gammaion1: and the attrition concept applies to videos as well, views build up over time
[2017-03-19 18:01:35 UTC] howlinthedeep: Did he announce beforehand that he was gonna stream?
[2017-03-19 18:02:08 UTC] howlinthedeep: Sometimes those tend to need traction as youtube can be seen whenever someone wants to
[2017-03-19 18:02:17 UTC] retrothicc2b: ResidentSleeper
[2017-03-19 18:02:30 UTC] darksydephil: aha!
[2017-03-19 18:02:30 UTC] eternia_forever: i believe the saying goes there not Dolls there action figures lol @Gammaion1
[2017-03-19 18:02:31 UTC] darksydephil: i figured it out!
[2017-03-19 18:02:39 UTC] retrothicc2b: dspSurpriseddsp
[2017-03-19 18:02:41 UTC] darksydephil: someone a year ago figured out the issue with adsense lol
[2017-03-19 18:02:41 UTC] darthvidarviking: what did you figure out phil?
[2017-03-19 18:02:44 UTC] howlinthedeep: Yay!

[2017-03-19 18:03:44 UTC] gammaion1: well with being such a huge company, its no wonder youtube/google has a big ego
[2017-03-19 18:03:45 UTC] jackwhite2000: why are patron chosen playthroughs always japanesse games?
[2017-03-19 18:03:51 UTC] darthvidarviking: people are just so desperate to troll with you it's ridiculous
[2017-03-19 18:03:56 UTC] darksydephil: whenever i see the names of charaters n danganronpa i stop reading and just delete lol

[2017-03-19 18:08:01 UTC] sanguinenite: @jackwhite2000 Because the patreon supporters are usually smarter than the general viewers and appreciate good storylines like certain Japanese games which are very similar to visual novels
[2017-03-19 18:08:25 UTC] retrothicc2b: didn't SJWs attack troy for making a joke at bruce jenner's transition
[2017-03-19 18:08:37 UTC] sanguinenite: You can say, such people appreciate being read a good story, which Phil does a good enough job of narrating
