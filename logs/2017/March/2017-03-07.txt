[2017-03-07 19:03:11 UTC] blue_blur64: The funny thing is, the conversation this guy is having is nothing compared to what nappy has talked about with his friends LUL
[2017-03-07 19:03:17 UTC] darksydephil: so i asked in the WIP last night about keeping comments enabled on dspgaming or disabling them. one person responded lol
[2017-03-07 19:03:26 UTC] poorlymade: I think disable them Phil
[2017-03-07 19:03:30 UTC] sonsofkojima1: disable them
[2017-03-07 19:03:32 UTC] deltaforce355: one person?
[2017-03-07 19:03:32 UTC] blue_blur64: On the forums most people are against it
[2017-03-07 19:03:33 UTC] poorlymade: the trolls are going to tell you to keep them
[2017-03-07 19:03:33 UTC] podusmonens: I will have to take K-dog Jr. in for private tutoring bethe I'm afraid you will ruin him
[2017-03-07 19:03:40 UTC] betheboom: pepsicola
[2017-03-07 19:03:43 UTC] poorlymade: They want to get featured in hater videos
[2017-03-07 19:03:45 UTC] popsicolo: HeyGuys
[2017-03-07 19:03:46 UTC] blue_blur64: Against disabling I mean
[2017-03-07 19:03:49 UTC] sonsofkojima1: i am drinking pepsi right now :)
[2017-03-07 19:03:52 UTC] poorlymade: we can talk to you in the forums and twitter and here
[2017-03-07 19:03:55 UTC] poorlymade: fuck the comments
[2017-03-07 19:03:57 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: A few responded on the forum phil. I don't think it is a good idea disabling them.
[2017-03-07 19:04:02 UTC] howlinthedeep: I saw multiple comments on the youtube video saying the king of hate can't deal with comments lol
[2017-03-07 19:04:05 UTC] poorlymade: Why Vidar?
[2017-03-07 19:04:11 UTC] poorlymade: You want him to get trolled all the time?
[2017-03-07 19:04:13 UTC] betheboom: dragin ok im sure we would need a break of him/her by then
[2017-03-07 19:04:21 UTC] poorlymade: It's just another method to troll him without any control.
[2017-03-07 19:04:33 UTC] sonsofkojima1: disabling comments will keep trolls awau
[2017-03-07 19:04:35 UTC] lvlpower: who is this guy hosting ?
[2017-03-07 19:04:53 UTC] podusmonens: i'm taking b. too. she will go after the kid
[2017-03-07 19:04:58 UTC] poorlymade: Disabling comments is literally the only thing he can control to get rid of trolling
[2017-03-07 19:05:02 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: The trolling serves him positively, it shows people what he have to endure
[2017-03-07 19:05:03 UTC] luk0ss: disable comments
[2017-03-07 19:05:11 UTC] betheboom: no dragin nope
[2017-03-07 19:05:13 UTC] poorlymade: Do you allow trolling here Vidar?
[2017-03-07 19:05:22 UTC] sonsofkojima1: phil some people were wondering if you will still do DSP tries it?
[2017-03-07 19:05:26 UTC] zuadjin517: disabling comments affects your viewer interaction
[2017-03-07 19:05:29 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: if he tries sensuring it he will look like some anita sarkeesian person it is not something that will benefint him
[2017-03-07 19:05:34 UTC] blue_blur64: vlogs aren't changing kojima
[2017-03-07 19:05:40 UTC] podusmonens: yup :)
[2017-03-07 19:05:41 UTC] poorlymade: Because if it doesn't fly here he shouldn't have to put up with it on YouTube
[2017-03-07 19:05:49 UTC] sonsofkojima1: ok good dsp tries it is my fav
[2017-03-07 19:05:50 UTC] luk0ss: yt comments are cancer

[2017-03-07 19:06:05 UTC] sonsofkojima1: Hey phil some people want you to try the shamrock shake from mcdonalds
[2017-03-07 19:06:05 UTC] darksydephil: okay i guess ill leave comments as-is for now
[2017-03-07 19:06:08 UTC] zuadjin517: i meant engagement
[2017-03-07 19:06:10 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I know they are cancer and people know they are cancer for the most part no need to sensur them
[2017-03-07 19:06:14 UTC] poorlymade: I think that's a mistake Phil
[2017-03-07 19:06:20 UTC] lvlpower: I just wanted know why this guy hosting on Phil stream
[2017-03-07 19:06:28 UTC] poorlymade: Since you mentioned it the trolls will be out in full force
[2017-03-07 19:06:30 UTC] blue_blur64: No, Phil is hosting dargon
[2017-03-07 19:06:34 UTC] podusmonens: who won? Zelda?
[2017-03-07 19:06:36 UTC] blue_blur64: Not the other way around
[2017-03-07 19:06:39 UTC] blue_blur64: !schedule
[2017-03-07 19:06:39 UTC] nightbot: Thanks to the poll votes, today is the continuation of Zelda: BOTW!
[2017-03-07 19:06:48 UTC] podusmonens: oh fuck
[2017-03-07 19:06:49 UTC] deltaforce355: yes @podusmonens
[2017-03-07 19:06:49 UTC] poorlymade: I think it will make it worse if you mention taking away comments and then don't, now the trolls are going to do it extra
[2017-03-07 19:06:56 UTC] podusmonens: :(
[2017-03-07 19:07:00 UTC] tourwithme: What does it mean to "host" someone?
[2017-03-07 19:07:02 UTC] betheboom: dragin no
[2017-03-07 19:07:10 UTC] deltaforce355: you wish bethe
[2017-03-07 19:07:11 UTC] blue_blur64: poorly, they would do it extra anyway :P
[2017-03-07 19:07:16 UTC] 0megaj0ker: did Phil hose someone?
[2017-03-07 19:07:18 UTC] podusmonens: there's a montage on yt of people having problems with the switch
[2017-03-07 19:07:18 UTC] bloodborne2day: yes, what does it mean to 'host' someone
[2017-03-07 19:07:20 UTC] betheboom: you swore imma tell on you dragibn
[2017-03-07 19:07:23 UTC] podusmonens: man oh man they fucked up

[2017-03-07 19:07:28 UTC] philtheboss2367: The trolls have no lives anyway so...
[2017-03-07 19:07:31 UTC] sonsofkojima1: id say disable comments on dspgaming but keep comments on vlog channel cause people like commenting on there
[2017-03-07 19:07:32 UTC] popsicolo: Host? I wanna host, but I don't know Japanese TriHard
[2017-03-07 19:07:33 UTC] lvlpower: !Thebot Beyond that of a super Sayain God blue MrDestructoid

[2017-03-07 19:07:55 UTC] betheboom: dragin shhhh
[2017-03-07 19:07:56 UTC] podusmonens: I think phil is better off playing it on the wii u if you can believe it
[2017-03-07 19:07:57 UTC] poorlymade: Phil said himself he doesn't even read them, so it is literally just hosting a place for trolls to insult him.
[2017-03-07 19:08:23 UTC] podusmonens: it's the hardware's fault bethe not the game
[2017-03-07 19:08:31 UTC] tourwithme: Can we watch Phil instead of this guy?
[2017-03-07 19:08:34 UTC] freshjiivetv: hello everyone
[2017-03-07 19:08:35 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: You see the act of disabling them are more negative than the comments in and of them self
[2017-03-07 19:08:44 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: that is why he should keep them
[2017-03-07 19:08:44 UTC] rpgasm34: go fight Ludwig lol
[2017-03-07 19:08:48 UTC] popsicolo: Phil says we're starting in a moment
[2017-03-07 19:08:50 UTC] lvlpower: @freshjiivetv wazzup
[2017-03-07 19:08:56 UTC] freshjiivetv: Diud that guy just say he was going to fuck a dog? :/
[2017-03-07 19:09:02 UTC] ornightz: WTF since when phil hosts anybody lmfao
[2017-03-07 19:09:02 UTC] poorlymade: That's incorrect vidar, because no one cares except the trolls
[2017-03-07 19:09:05 UTC] popsicolo: Lets see this guy fight Ludwig TriHard
[2017-03-07 19:09:11 UTC] poorlymade: Who cares if they are mad about not having comments?
[2017-03-07 19:09:18 UTC] podusmonens: maybe phil should be more careful with people he hosts lol
[2017-03-07 19:09:25 UTC] howlinthedeep: Not true PoorlyMade. I like leaving comments when I go there
[2017-03-07 19:09:28 UTC] poorlymade: Other than this chat where else can his trolls go after him publicly and get attention?
[2017-03-07 19:09:37 UTC] blue_blur64: Pop, he's showing me how bad I am LUL
[2017-03-07 19:09:38 UTC] podusmonens: who cares
[2017-03-07 19:09:41 UTC] deltaforce355: wonder if phil will ever use the green screen again?
[2017-03-07 19:09:53 UTC] a_scoundrel: What do you think of DSP though?
[2017-03-07 19:09:58 UTC] lvlpower: Hopfully Phil expands things
[2017-03-07 19:10:02 UTC] sonsofkojima1: i think people (trolls and fans) like commenting on the vlogs so he should keep those
[2017-03-07 19:10:02 UTC] podusmonens: trolls are a natural part of the dsp ecosystem, they will never go away
[2017-03-07 19:10:17 UTC] popsicolo: I'd ask Phil to host me, but the one game I want to stream right now is banned on Twitch KappaHD
[2017-03-07 19:10:35 UTC] howlinthedeep: What game is that pepsicola?

[2017-03-07 19:11:00 UTC] lvlpower: lol @popsicolo
[2017-03-07 19:11:01 UTC] podusmonens: is it sexual pops? or why is it banned?

[2017-03-07 19:19:49 UTC] podusmonens: "short prestream" is an oxymoron for phil
[2017-03-07 19:19:52 UTC] insaiyan9000: is 4 gaming hours the same as 4 regular hours?
[2017-03-07 19:19:53 UTC] betheboom: goldberg got rekt and roman reigns got rekt that is the 2 good things happened on raw
[2017-03-07 19:19:59 UTC] mikebpfallon: he's gone to put clothes on. he like to address his stream naked as he wakes up

[2017-03-07 19:20:32 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Since Taker was eliminated by Roman
[2017-03-07 19:20:33 UTC] blue_blur64: @lvlpower, Phil is the one that hosts
[2017-03-07 19:20:44 UTC] ginosaji48: Taker's segment was lame on RAW
[2017-03-07 19:20:47 UTC] phoenixrising2015: And all he did was sit up and stare at Roman like "You know what you just did, right?"
[2017-03-07 19:20:49 UTC] lvlpower: I want dspSurpriseddsp
[2017-03-07 19:20:52 UTC] podusmonens: no pants is a tacit prerequisite

[2017-03-07 19:21:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: The best Taker Rumble moment was when Maven eliminated him
[2017-03-07 19:21:14 UTC] mikebpfallon: should be his new moto...new pants, just games.
[2017-03-07 19:21:18 UTC] mikebpfallon: no
[2017-03-07 19:21:19 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Maven jumped up and down cheering

[2017-03-07 19:21:24 UTC] betheboom: dragin shh
[2017-03-07 19:21:24 UTC] ginosaji48: i prefer Braun over reigns and taker
[2017-03-07 19:21:25 UTC] fibonaccispagetti: just watching this stream makes me want bacon
[2017-03-07 19:21:27 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and then Taker looked back
[2017-03-07 19:21:31 UTC] blue_blur64: Well I'm excited to see Jericho vs Owens
[2017-03-07 19:21:36 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and Maven went from "YES!" to "Oh no...."
[2017-03-07 19:21:40 UTC] lvlpower: @blue_blur64 how there was dargonsouls hosting on Phil stream o.o
[2017-03-07 19:21:42 UTC] mfd4419: Hellos
[2017-03-07 19:21:42 UTC] capstonegaming: Baron Corbin vs Undertaker

[2017-03-07 19:21:45 UTC] mikebpfallon: Braun is a great talent
[2017-03-07 19:21:52 UTC] blue_blur64: power, Phil hosted dargon's stream
[2017-03-07 19:21:56 UTC] betheboom: ewww baron corbin
[2017-03-07 19:22:00 UTC] capstonegaming: :(
[2017-03-07 19:22:04 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: Why is there demand for cena vs taker?
[2017-03-07 19:22:11 UTC] podusmonens: yeah, playing zelda with bethe's mancrush, Link
[2017-03-07 19:22:23 UTC] betheboom: <3
[2017-03-07 19:22:24 UTC] noobrydar: The undertaker still wrestles? WTF?
[2017-03-07 19:22:24 UTC] capstonegaming: cuz taker gotta pass the torch to somebody great
[2017-03-07 19:22:26 UTC] blue_blur64: I think it was because Cena talked smack about him with Taker being at Smackdown
[2017-03-07 19:22:27 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Seriously if anyone hasn't seen the rumble with Maven eliminating Taker its hilarious
[2017-03-07 19:22:27 UTC] lvlpower: @blue_blur64 I just wanted to know that is all thanks
[2017-03-07 19:22:34 UTC] blue_blur64: *without
[2017-03-07 19:22:43 UTC] noobrydar: The undertaker should be retired by now
[2017-03-07 19:22:47 UTC] ginosaji48: Braun had awesome fight at Fastlane, lost and at RAW it took just one choke slam to hurt Reigns, fucking pathetic
[2017-03-07 19:22:48 UTC] fibonaccispagetti: i would love to sniff her tarts tbh
[2017-03-07 19:23:03 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Taker literally falls out of the ring(Hes the biker Taker at this point) and looks in disbelief as Maven is jumping up and down in happiness
[2017-03-07 19:23:12 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and Taker turns around with this straight stare
[2017-03-07 19:23:13 UTC] blue_blur64: You don't fuck with Taker Kappa
[2017-03-07 19:23:18 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and Maven just goes O_O
[2017-03-07 19:23:20 UTC] betheboom: gino because reigns is a unk bitch
[2017-03-07 19:23:23 UTC] minnesotafine: Because Raw only puts part timers over
[2017-03-07 19:23:23 UTC] betheboom: punk*
[2017-03-07 19:23:28 UTC] noobrydar: Taker is an old grandpa by now
[2017-03-07 19:23:33 UTC] podusmonens: ok so chat went full wwe retard
[2017-03-07 19:23:42 UTC] fibonaccispagetti: no u
[2017-03-07 19:23:43 UTC] ginosaji48: taker should be retired two years ago
[2017-03-07 19:23:43 UTC] blue_blur64: Well what are they gonna do with the universal title after WM?
[2017-03-07 19:23:46 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: wow dood
[2017-03-07 19:23:57 UTC] betheboom: gino agreed
[2017-03-07 19:24:02 UTC] noobrydar: just makes the wwe looks dumb having someone that old continue to wrestle, he needs to retire
[2017-03-07 19:24:03 UTC] deltaforce355: did they put taker on the hall of fame gino?
[2017-03-07 19:24:05 UTC] blue_blur64: Since it's basically between 2 part-timers
[2017-03-07 19:24:09 UTC] betheboom: silent nothing
[2017-03-07 19:24:11 UTC] minnesotafine: @blue_blur64, odds are Brock will have it and it'll be just like two years ago
[2017-03-07 19:24:14 UTC] mikebpfallon: Goldberg must have in his contract... not allowed to go more than 3mins.
[2017-03-07 19:24:19 UTC] finiteresource: dude wrestling lmao
[2017-03-07 19:24:28 UTC] fibonaccispagetti: if he starts right now he will be 6 minutes early
[2017-03-07 19:24:32 UTC] noobrydar: The undertaker should be out playing golf with Obama some where
[2017-03-07 19:24:42 UTC] aglet57: The Undertaker looks like shit
[2017-03-07 19:24:43 UTC] spookywun: thought stream started at 11?
[2017-03-07 19:24:52 UTC] blue_blur64: It's never exact Spooky
[2017-03-07 19:24:57 UTC] ginosaji48: and same with Lesnar, he got his ass kicked multiple times, and now he hit F5 on Goldberg what means that he will win the title at WM 33, thats what i call fucking bullshit
[2017-03-07 19:24:59 UTC] clesstheangei: I'm lost in the world of zelda, so much shit to see
[2017-03-07 19:25:02 UTC] fibonaccispagetti: phil doesnt use an alarm
[2017-03-07 19:25:10 UTC] spookywun: then why mention it?
[2017-03-07 19:25:17 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: When will Phil do asmr?
[2017-03-07 19:25:23 UTC] blue_blur64: I say that Goldberg will win Gino, just my prediction
[2017-03-07 19:25:25 UTC] fibonaccispagetti: why mention waht
[2017-03-07 19:25:26 UTC] prinkster124: wrestling in 2017 Kappa
[2017-03-07 19:25:29 UTC] betheboom: gino thats wwe for ya
[2017-03-07 19:25:32 UTC] nightlynow: how do I donate?
[2017-03-07 19:25:42 UTC] finiteresource: cher with bits
[2017-03-07 19:25:43 UTC] aglet57: @SpookyWuN Live at 11AM, prestream is usually around now. Gameplay is about 11:45AM.
[2017-03-07 19:25:47 UTC] betheboom: ok silent vs gino over goldberg vs lesnar
[2017-03-07 19:25:51 UTC] blue_blur64: Use bits. Type cheer and a number without a space
[2017-03-07 19:25:54 UTC] ginosaji48: i mean RAW doesnt deserve to have rights for making events
[2017-03-07 19:26:01 UTC] deltaforce355: Cripple H is doing best for business to piss us off betheboom
[2017-03-07 19:26:04 UTC] fibonaccispagetti: when will prestream overtake the gameplay.
[2017-03-07 19:26:06 UTC] mikebpfallon: you don't donate Phil just turns up at your house and beats the money out of you
[2017-03-07 19:26:11 UTC] blue_blur64: Just make sure you buy bits or watch ads for bits first :P
[2017-03-07 19:26:19 UTC] blue_blur64: Like in Yakuza Kappa
[2017-03-07 19:26:22 UTC] betheboom: delta yep
[2017-03-07 19:26:23 UTC] blue_blur64: @mikebpfallon,
[2017-03-07 19:26:27 UTC] spookywun: oh i would assume he would start playing at 11 and do a pre stream of w/e before that to be on time.
[2017-03-07 19:26:29 UTC] noobrydar: wrestling is boring now. not as fun as it use to be back in the days chyna and hulk hogan
[2017-03-07 19:26:32 UTC] mikebpfallon: yup. exactly
[2017-03-07 19:26:36 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Mr. Shakedown
[2017-03-07 19:26:43 UTC] fibonaccispagetti: no spooky things dont work like that around here
[2017-03-07 19:26:46 UTC] blue_blur64: Nah, the schedule is very loose spooky. You get used to it
[2017-03-07 19:26:49 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Maybe I can get the perk to get 1.5 times the money back
[2017-03-07 19:26:51 UTC] ginosaji48: hulk hogan in 2017 WutFace
[2017-03-07 19:26:56 UTC] fibonaccispagetti: as stanley from the office says "this is a run out the clock situation"
[2017-03-07 19:26:58 UTC] phoenixrising2015: and use that to collect interest and get tons of cash
[2017-03-07 19:27:03 UTC] aglet57: @SpookyWuN Yup. You would.
[2017-03-07 19:27:08 UTC] aglet57: No argument from me.
[2017-03-07 19:27:15 UTC] spookywun: oh well...
[2017-03-07 19:27:21 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: aj vs randy
[2017-03-07 19:27:28 UTC] blue_blur64: Here's another question guys. Do you think Rollins will be ready for WM?
[2017-03-07 19:27:34 UTC] capstonegaming: yes
[2017-03-07 19:27:37 UTC] betheboom: gino a red old saggy being saying brother WutFace

[2017-03-07 19:28:13 UTC] phoenixrising2015: but he may be in better shape then they are telling
[2017-03-07 19:28:14 UTC] blue_blur64: Well I'm not asking if he'll show up because I know he will no matter what LUL
[2017-03-07 19:28:21 UTC] goo110: dspHmm
[2017-03-07 19:28:25 UTC] aglet57: Rollins/HHH won't be a match. It's going to be a brawl with no ref.
[2017-03-07 19:28:33 UTC] aglet57: Protects Rollins
[2017-03-07 19:28:34 UTC] phoenixrising2015: But he legit hut his previously operated on knee when Joe was chokinghim out

[2017-03-07 23:08:45 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: wtf was that video Gino WutFace
[2017-03-07 23:08:45 UTC] zahvone: Muxy is another great alternative.
[2017-03-07 23:08:50 UTC] podusmonens: old meme gino
[2017-03-07 23:08:57 UTC] betheboom: vidar gino = ResidentSleeper

[2017-03-07 23:09:14 UTC] encelor: @DarksydePhil apparantly according to reddit there is a alternative to streamlabs called muxy,io
[2017-03-07 23:09:22 UTC] lvlpower: stream is over
[2017-03-07 23:09:25 UTC] yacherdy: maybe streamjar(dot)tv?
[2017-03-07 23:09:36 UTC] yacherdy: I'd try Muxy
[2017-03-07 23:09:43 UTC] finiteresource: so what are you gonna do phil
[2017-03-07 23:09:45 UTC] sonsofkojima1: phil just reset obs
[2017-03-07 23:09:46 UTC] simonrez: Ah yes, Muxy. That has some nice interactions with other programs like Discord
[2017-03-07 23:09:47 UTC] mfd4419: Turn off the porn in that will help a little
[2017-03-07 23:09:50 UTC] darksydephil: i deleted and re-added the browser source
[2017-03-07 23:09:51 UTC] darksydephil: going to try this
[2017-03-07 23:10:05 UTC] skysands2017: Let's hope it works
[2017-03-07 23:10:06 UTC] darksydephil: ill also hae to try muxy if this keeps up
[2017-03-07 23:10:06 UTC] zahvone: You might be using outdated version of the browser plugin, Phil
[2017-03-07 23:10:19 UTC] darksydephil: its the update from this morning lol
[2017-03-07 23:10:19 UTC] zahvone: OBS Studio should automatically install the browser source plugin
[2017-03-07 23:10:20 UTC] darksydephil: the obs update
[2017-03-07 23:10:20 UTC] tazdevilz1986: update flash and disabled the built in one in chrome

[2017-03-07 23:11:49 UTC] zahvone: I see
[2017-03-07 23:11:57 UTC] darksydephil: i guess ill restart
[2017-03-07 23:11:57 UTC] zahvone: Okay, well it's not streamlabs, then
[2017-03-07 23:11:58 UTC] darksydephil: sigh
[2017-03-07 23:12:05 UTC] zahvone: It's definitely OBS, or the browser plugin
[2017-03-07 23:12:10 UTC] darksydephil: no its that bootstrap.exe crashing
[2017-03-07 23:12:12 UTC] darksydephil: it says it every time
[2017-03-07 23:12:17 UTC] tazdevilz1986: Frustrating i know, but you have to fix it Phil no stress
[2017-03-07 23:12:19 UTC] zahvone: Oh no shit? okay hold on
[2017-03-07 23:12:21 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: The expert GrammarKing
[2017-03-07 23:12:40 UTC] tazdevilz1986: I'll research that

[2017-03-07 23:12:51 UTC] digitaljeff51: *sigh
[2017-03-07 23:12:52 UTC] darksydephil: i closed them
[2017-03-07 23:12:56 UTC] darksydephil: maybe now it wont happen again
[2017-03-07 23:13:01 UTC] cplkevlar: Whats going on fellow gamers?
[2017-03-07 23:13:08 UTC] zahvone: Okay so
[2017-03-07 23:13:11 UTC] zahvone: Phil, now that you've closed them
[2017-03-07 23:13:17 UTC] zahvone: uninstall OBS, and reinstall OBS Studio
[2017-03-07 23:13:24 UTC] cplkevlar: Wow
[2017-03-07 23:13:26 UTC] tazdevilz1986: that's a virus
[2017-03-07 23:13:32 UTC] finiteresource: he is subscribed to himself, lol
[2017-03-07 23:13:43 UTC] darksydephil: oh great now they dont work at all lol
[2017-03-07 23:13:48 UTC] howlinthedeep: everyone is subscribed to themselves by default finiteresource
[2017-03-07 23:13:51 UTC] zahvone: I think it was a registry issue conflicting with the old version
[2017-03-07 23:13:55 UTC] skysands2017: wtf
[2017-03-07 23:13:56 UTC] cplkevlar: Okay then technical difficulties and some light hearted trolling

[2017-03-07 23:14:18 UTC] podusmonens: ubuntu is too hardcore for me
[2017-03-07 23:14:27 UTC] cplkevlar: Wow
[2017-03-07 23:14:31 UTC] roubador: Bootstrap.exe problems can be attributed to corrupt or missing files, invalid registry entries associated with Bootstrap.exe, or a virus / malware infection.
[2017-03-07 23:14:32 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: @ginosaji48 I am finding the deadliest spoon in my house. You better be careful.
[2017-03-07 23:14:41 UTC] demonlord1993x: how hardcore is LINUX vs Windows?
[2017-03-07 23:14:43 UTC] zahvone: The deadliest spoon lol
[2017-03-07 23:15:04 UTC] podusmonens: linus
[2017-03-07 23:15:15 UTC] howlinthedeep: good ol linus
[2017-03-07 23:15:16 UTC] zahvone: But yeah @DarksydePhil Once you close those cef bootstraps, uninstall OBS and reinstall the studio version (If you didn't already)

[2017-03-07 23:15:25 UTC] yacherdy: LinusTechTips PogChamp
[2017-03-07 23:15:25 UTC] roubador: that was about bootstrap exe
[2017-03-07 23:15:27 UTC] hapticbabyman: @jmon_1985 I actually prefer having more than 5 games to choose from xD
[2017-03-07 23:15:31 UTC] simonrez: He should probably run a virus scan, if he hasn't done one in a while
[2017-03-07 23:15:37 UTC] encelor: did stream come back do i need to refresh?
[2017-03-07 23:15:42 UTC] yacherdy: Malwarebytes and Avast yo

[2017-03-07 23:16:14 UTC] finiteresource: come on phil, fix it already
[2017-03-07 23:16:19 UTC] darksydephil: damn all 3 of them need to be open for the on screen notifications to work
[2017-03-07 23:16:26 UTC] darksydephil: if i close one, the test fails
[2017-03-07 23:16:28 UTC] jmon_1985: My Mac has windows on it so in can choose from more than 5 games too @hapticbabyman
[2017-03-07 23:16:29 UTC] tazdevilz1986: :just so you know if you want to correct this error when installing you have to open your task manager and end the process for cef-bootstrap.exe it hangs up so ending it and trying the reinstall works perfectly I found. Hope this helps! maybe that one helps too.
[2017-03-07 23:16:34 UTC] mfd4419: It really is rip
[2017-03-07 23:16:40 UTC] riouinsuiko: Can you just turn off notifications for now?

[2017-03-07 23:19:04 UTC] zahvone: You might as well
[2017-03-07 23:19:24 UTC] tourwithme: Phil you should use Elgato gaming capture software, it look like it works for PC gaming but more for console gaming
[2017-03-07 23:19:25 UTC] finiteresource: this has amateur vibe to it
[2017-03-07 23:19:35 UTC] demonlord1993x: control panel-->uninstall a program dood

[2017-03-07 23:20:12 UTC] zahvone: :(
[2017-03-07 23:20:13 UTC] tourwithme: Yeah, I'm thinking of getting Elgato

[2017-03-07 23:20:20 UTC] ral241: What's up
[2017-03-07 23:20:22 UTC] zahvone: I have an Elgato. I fucking love it

[2017-03-07 23:20:39 UTC] podusmonens: phil needs to become tech savy
[2017-03-07 23:20:45 UTC] zahvone: Well, Phil. Do it on your off day, then.
[2017-03-07 23:20:53 UTC] encelor: i china they eat elgato's in yuge portions Kappa
[2017-03-07 23:20:54 UTC] yacherdy: What does Elgato have over OBS aside from not using resources on your PC?
[2017-03-07 23:21:00 UTC] aloofone: play without cheers for the rest of the stream
[2017-03-07 23:21:09 UTC] eternia_forever: wow just getting back into my room and i see the problems continue wtf
[2017-03-07 23:21:15 UTC] zahvone: The video quality of the Elgato is phenominal. OBS can make good video as well, but Elgato is just streamlined
[2017-03-07 23:21:22 UTC] yacherdy: Ah
[2017-03-07 23:21:24 UTC] zahvone: Less learning curve, it *feels* premium, in a sense.
[2017-03-07 23:21:31 UTC] ginosaji48: it would be funny if that OBS crashing was caused by cheering
[2017-03-07 23:21:38 UTC] tourwithme: plus you can stream from elgato
[2017-03-07 23:21:44 UTC] podusmonens: el gato = the cat? :D
[2017-03-07 23:21:49 UTC] zahvone: You can, but I wouldn't recommend streaming from the elgato
[2017-03-07 23:21:50 UTC] tazdevilz1986: yeah better do it later phil
[2017-03-07 23:22:01 UTC] yacherdy: yes dragin
[2017-03-07 23:22:13 UTC] encelor: its not easy being phil U.U Kappa
[2017-03-07 23:22:13 UTC] tourwithme: @Zahvone why?
[2017-03-07 23:22:16 UTC] zahvone: It does have this issue where when streaming, if you use overlays it'll try putting out double bandwith
[2017-03-07 23:22:20 UTC] zahvone: Which, will destroy the stream
[2017-03-07 23:22:35 UTC] betheboom: no it isnt ginos*a*i*
[2017-03-07 23:22:35 UTC] tazdevilz1986: Yeah forget it do it later
[2017-03-07 23:22:38 UTC] zahvone: You can however, use the Elgato feed to OBS using "Video capture device" and it will work that way, flawlessly.
[2017-03-07 23:22:41 UTC] eltaco1234: woe is me
[2017-03-07 23:22:57 UTC] betheboom: what i do

[2017-03-07 23:45:01 UTC] tourwithme: @Zahvone So even if I'm not recording for youtube but playing ps4 should I still leave the Elgato capture device all plugged in?
[2017-03-07 23:45:16 UTC] podusmonens: it's obvious but you might be in a rush and dont pay attention for a sec. and you;re fucked

[2017-03-07 23:45:30 UTC] doctormaul: Nintendo should have charged 349 for switch but have a nonscratch screen

[2017-03-07 23:45:47 UTC] zahvone: @tourwithme Yep. You could do that, in fact I would encourage it!
[2017-03-07 23:45:49 UTC] kinggoken: yeah i agree the screen should be non scratch
[2017-03-07 23:45:49 UTC] yacherdy: Beck off Kappa

[2017-03-07 23:46:15 UTC] demonlord1993x: @doctormaul nintendo should have pulled decent hardware out of their asses and support the wii U until end this year
[2017-03-07 23:46:16 UTC] tazdevilz1986: hmm
[2017-03-07 23:46:18 UTC] howlinthedeep: Lots of women love long nails
[2017-03-07 23:46:19 UTC] zahvone: @tourwithme The Elgato (even if not recording) can capture footage. For example, you're not recording but some funny glitch happens
[2017-03-07 23:46:22 UTC] tazdevilz1986: again crash?
[2017-03-07 23:46:42 UTC] podusmonens: I kno deep

[2017-03-07 23:46:50 UTC] yacherdy: like the ones that are 5 inches long
[2017-03-07 23:46:52 UTC] eltaco1234: ?

[2017-03-07 23:48:04 UTC] howlinthedeep: She just sounds like a feminine irish woman
[2017-03-07 23:48:08 UTC] yacherdy: Zoya is a good brand
[2017-03-07 23:48:09 UTC] podusmonens: ok I dont like bex anymore :(
[2017-03-07 23:48:18 UTC] zahvone: @tourwithme Anymore questions I could help you with?

[2017-03-07 23:48:28 UTC] yacherdy: that was the goal dragin
[2017-03-07 23:48:30 UTC] tourwithme: @Zahvone yeah but you need your laptop open to open the capture software right? Like your laptop is open while playing?
[2017-03-07 23:48:37 UTC] yacherdy: it was his plan all along
[2017-03-07 23:48:43 UTC] betheboom: she would be sad dragin
[2017-03-07 23:48:54 UTC] demonlord1993x: @gtmagrin there is no damn gameplay dood
[2017-03-07 23:48:58 UTC] zahvone: @tourwithme Yes. Unfortunately the Elgato doesn't have internal memory to do that. That would be really sweet functionality though!
[2017-03-07 23:49:31 UTC] theycallmejimbob: poor Becky :(
[2017-03-07 23:49:31 UTC] zahvone: @tourwithme You'll have to download the Elgato capture software (really painless to install and use). Once you've done that, you get to experience
[2017-03-07 23:49:33 UTC] encelor: Kappa
[2017-03-07 23:49:36 UTC] skolvikings944: @betheboom, Lets be honest, you've never touched a woman in your life. Maybe not even really talked to one. You sit on twitch day after day watching a failed YouTuber trying to milk the rest of the cash out of his dying channels. No woman is going to be attracted to that, they'll just think you're a fucking retard like Phil is. Ban me all you want, shit mods, but you know deep down it's true.

[2017-03-07 23:52:12 UTC] thetedster: Unfollowed. I only follow Breath of the Wild Streamers that Solely cook salads in-game. The abuse and mistreatment of wolves, bats, crabs, and other creatures in the game is appalling. Poor Link and the demolition of the world at the hands of Ganon? More like poor mistreatment of the wild life. If you stand for #PETA and agree, a proper copy/paste is appreciated.
[2017-03-07 23:52:13 UTC] zahvone: @tourwithme Once you hit record, it will record. Once you hit it again, the software will stop recording the video. You'll be able to do slight edits in the software as well. Additionally, the videos are saved to the harddrive, and can be accessed in software for uploading to Youtube, Facebook, twitter, etc.

[2017-03-07 23:54:58 UTC] thetedster: Unfollowed. I only follow Breath of the Wild Streamers that Solely cook salads in-game. The abuse and mistreatment of wolves, bats, crabs, and other creatures in the game is appalling. Poor Link and the demolition of the world at the hands of Ganon? More like poor mistreatment of the wild life. If you stand for #PETA and agree, a proper copy/paste is appreciated.
