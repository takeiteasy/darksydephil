[2017-03-11 19:27:43 UTC] 2booty4u: Phil, why not create a short video for youtube announcing that you have just started streaming? you can upload when you start the stream and remove it once its over

[2017-03-11 21:55:19 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: Does Phil ever stream more popular games like overwatch or counterstrike? He'd probably get a ton of more viewers since not many people know about this game

[2017-03-11 22:58:29 UTC] dukaduka: agreed
[2017-03-11 22:58:40 UTC] doctormaul: Nier is same setting as Drakengard right?

[2017-03-11 22:58:48 UTC] encelor: the music is good
[2017-03-11 22:58:58 UTC] dukaduka: @doctormaul, same story but way in the future
[2017-03-11 22:58:59 UTC] eminiclam: drakengard 1 ending E leads to Nier
[2017-03-11 22:59:01 UTC] optionalsuperboss: its sorta the same world doctormaul
[2017-03-11 22:59:09 UTC] betheboom: dragin i just laughed at her temper tantrum
[2017-03-11 22:59:11 UTC] hisui4: @fattyboy067 they said automata follows the self sacrifice x cloning plot line. with the alien invasion of earth using hybrid mechanical alien lifeforms as the robots. like transformers basically
[2017-03-11 22:59:12 UTC] doctormaul: Thanks
[2017-03-11 22:59:33 UTC] dukaduka: @Eminiclam, timelines too many timelines NotLikeThis worse than zelda
[2017-03-11 22:59:49 UTC] eminiclam: ikr, drakengard 2 just made it more complicated
[2017-03-11 22:59:55 UTC] somone192: I only finished the first boss in nier in the desert
[2017-03-11 23:00:01 UTC] availableusername888: hisu4 come and get it who cares
[2017-03-11 23:00:11 UTC] optionalsuperboss: my understanding is the 'true ending' of Drakengard creates an alternative universe.. and thats the Nier-verse
[2017-03-11 23:00:18 UTC] hisui4: @dukaduka oh yeah trust me. the timline and plotlines get so complicated. definitely worse than zelda
[2017-03-11 23:00:19 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: Drakengard 2 is an embarrassment, Yoko Taro didn't even write the story for it
[2017-03-11 23:00:31 UTC] dukaduka: @somone192, then you're missing the best parts of the game. the other endings are great :D
[2017-03-11 23:00:39 UTC] encelor: @OptionalSuperboss it doe not create some of the characters end in the alternative universe
[2017-03-11 23:00:52 UTC] eminiclam: i know he did something in that game music ,character design or something
[2017-03-11 23:01:01 UTC] somone192: @dukaduka, do I need to do all the side missions for the other endings?
[2017-03-11 23:01:13 UTC] availableusername888: like jesus christ come and fucking get this game nobody cares
[2017-03-11 23:01:18 UTC] optionalsuperboss: yeah its the 'same' universe.. theres some cross over.. but shit changed or something. i didnt play em but read about it.. its weird =P

[2017-03-11 23:01:46 UTC] dukaduka: @somone192, i dont really know :P but you can just replay for the main 3 i think

[2017-03-11 23:02:05 UTC] doctormaul: I watched DSP for a long time. He's entertaining
[2017-03-11 23:02:05 UTC] eminiclam: drakengard and nier have the same requirement to get the true ending COLLECT ALL WEAPONS (a pain in the ass)
[2017-03-11 23:02:08 UTC] ginosaji8: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1FngSBTFOY

[2017-03-11 23:02:18 UTC] hisui4: @eminiclam apparently drakengard 2 is indepenedent. no media follows up from drakengard 2's timeline and plot. but they do refer to 1. so basically its drakengard 1 thennier then automata. with maybe a few novels and stuff in between. oh wait. drakengard 3 is included. so its drakengard 3 then drakengard 1 then nier then automata
[2017-03-11 23:02:36 UTC] howlinthedeep: GOOOOOLDBERG
[2017-03-11 23:02:40 UTC] fattyboy067: @Eminiclam Nier Automata doesn't require all the weapons, although I think it's required for a sidequest
[2017-03-11 23:02:48 UTC] encelor: @hisui4 in draken gard 2 you fight the anti hero from draken gard 1 MingLee
[2017-03-11 23:03:00 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: If you play Drakengard 3 on its own, you'd have no idea it connects to Drakengard 1, you have to read a book to get the connection
[2017-03-11 23:03:03 UTC] doctormaul: Going to hook up my ps2 and play Drakengard now. Lol
[2017-03-11 23:03:05 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: I hate when games do that shit
[2017-03-11 23:03:31 UTC] eminiclam: they did the same with nier
[2017-03-11 23:03:37 UTC] hisui4: @encelor it follows drakengard 1. what i mean is, there is no sequel to it. the developers consider it to be like a spinoff. nothing follows its timeline i mean.
[2017-03-11 23:03:38 UTC] eternia_forever: ps3 will be good to though @doctormaul
[2017-03-11 23:03:44 UTC] ginosaji8: now i cant wait to see Lesnar destroy Goldberg at WM 33, win the title and Goldberg retiring........
[2017-03-11 23:03:50 UTC] encelor: oh i see
[2017-03-11 23:03:50 UTC] doctormaul: Wonder if it's in psn store?
[2017-03-11 23:03:55 UTC] eminiclam: you only get the "alien invasion" ending on the ending E which isn't in the game disk
[2017-03-11 23:04:00 UTC] hayleyyx: Nothing beats his heavy rain play through
[2017-03-11 23:04:11 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: KROGAN BATTLEMASTER SwiftRage
[2017-03-11 23:04:16 UTC] hisui4: whereas drakengard 3 is supposedly prequel to drakengard 1 which leads to nier which then leads to automata
[2017-03-11 23:04:19 UTC] doctormaul: @eternia_forever thanks

[2017-03-11 23:11:51 UTC] picola122: phil is on form damn
[2017-03-11 23:11:51 UTC] eminiclam: to make it more complicated drakengard 3 (prequel to drakengard 1) has a manga that is a prequel to the game lol
[2017-03-11 23:12:12 UTC] kevindeleonisscum: WTF there's a Drakengard manga

[2017-03-11 23:13:37 UTC] eminiclam: and thats why people calls it DOD
[2017-03-11 23:13:38 UTC] hisui4: @eminiclam yep. its a real headache. drakengard 3 is like kingdomhearts lol super complicated and all over the place. i didnt even know she was in prosti..tution and all that dark stuff when i was watching phil play it
[2017-03-11 23:13:50 UTC] fattyboy067: I guess Dragon Dragoon sounds kinda confusing, and Drakengard is a mix of Dragon and Midgard, the land of the first game
[2017-03-11 23:14:00 UTC] harden_d_arc: maybe the first one on ds
[2017-03-11 23:14:09 UTC] retrothicc2b: RaccAttack get'em Phil

[2017-03-11 23:15:31 UTC] hisui4: @eminiclam its a shame though becwuse the story is really awesome and interesting, but the games by themselves dont convey it well enough.

[2017-03-11 23:18:26 UTC] hisui4: @kevindeleonisscum i dunno. like i said, if you give this game to someone who doesnt know any of the lore, they might be weirded out or get bored. you have to go out of your way literally in order to like and embrace it fully. and thats its biggest flaw imo. if they were more forward about what was going on then itd receive far greater praise than it does now

[2017-03-11 23:19:24 UTC] bestcompilationofficial: Extreme Feminists don't even know what they want anymore. They get mad at other women for doing photo-shoots when the points of feminism was to bring women up and give women more freedom
[2017-03-11 23:19:25 UTC] fattyboy067: ya the game's great but iI couldn't recommend it to everyone
[2017-03-11 23:19:45 UTC] unlimited_bw: I really hope no one here actually believes Griffith did anything wrong
[2017-03-11 23:19:54 UTC] somone192: isnt the issue too that there are different groups of feminism?
[2017-03-11 23:20:05 UTC] somone192: some want more sexuality freedom while others dont?
[2017-03-11 23:20:06 UTC] encelor: Griffith did nothing wrong mate

[2017-03-11 23:21:44 UTC] hisui4: @bestcompilationofficial extreme feminists are not feminists, they just prejudice against men. i understand over sexualizing a female character can be annoying. but why not answer that by sexualizing the men too. that way everyone on equal ground unless you anti sex appeal which has nothing to do with feminism. like i said before they just want attention or they want a lezbo planet with all men either dead or turned into slaves. i dunno.
