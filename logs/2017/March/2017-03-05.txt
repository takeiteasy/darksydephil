[2017-03-05 05:06:58 UTC] lvlpower: did the stream crash again
[2017-03-05 05:07:00 UTC] muttogamer: I mean, i don't blame him, but he isnt used to a twitch streamer life

[2017-03-05 05:07:07 UTC] sam_scratch: not enough cheers to continue
[2017-03-05 05:07:09 UTC] guinesspie: That was funny

[2017-03-05 05:07:27 UTC] stormforcegamer: Have a great day off tomorrow Phil. Hopefully you can relax a bit so your in top form on Monday.
[2017-03-05 05:07:41 UTC] wilkie1992: i couldnt cheer him last night cause twitch was being a cunt
[2017-03-05 05:07:50 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: Phil should do a co-op stream with lowti3rgod, there would be lots of viewers and cheers
[2017-03-05 05:08:01 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: ^
[2017-03-05 05:08:13 UTC] lorienawim: if he wants to build a viewer base, he needs to change this type of attitude. these things don't happen overnight..
[2017-03-05 05:08:25 UTC] guinesspie: How long ago was the jacking off incident? anyone know?
[2017-03-05 05:08:29 UTC] yacherdy: May 1st

[2017-03-05 05:08:44 UTC] wilkie1992: he should have stream a small bit of zelda last night
[2017-03-05 05:08:47 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I would love see Phil play Zelda but his not. Going do it cause Nintendo would get him strikes on YouTube
[2017-03-05 05:08:54 UTC] crazed_connovore: @yacherdy damn thats impressive
[2017-03-05 05:08:55 UTC] lvlpower: Phil having lot's of bad luck
[2017-03-05 05:08:56 UTC] beat43210: Rip obs
[2017-03-05 05:09:01 UTC] yacherdy: It was a glorious moment in Phil's history
[2017-03-05 05:09:13 UTC] guinesspie: Is what Nintendo does to YT channels legal? Under fair use?
[2017-03-05 05:09:13 UTC] yacherdy: Of course I remember a man jerking off BigBrother
[2017-03-05 05:09:26 UTC] wilkie1992: the end of dspgaming is a foot :(
[2017-03-05 05:09:30 UTC] beat43210: Well
[2017-03-05 05:09:31 UTC] muttogamer: it is legal
[2017-03-05 05:09:33 UTC] beat43210: Not really
[2017-03-05 05:09:40 UTC] beat43210: Fair but legal
[2017-03-05 05:09:49 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Nothing really wrong with his switch
[2017-03-05 05:09:58 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: I think will continue to do gaming stuff online even if he has to move back in with his parents
[2017-03-05 05:09:58 UTC] yacherdy: wilkie you might be flying a little too close to the sun my man
[2017-03-05 05:10:11 UTC] beat43210: Didn't he say it was bricked or something
[2017-03-05 05:10:11 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: *I think Phil will
[2017-03-05 05:10:14 UTC] yacherdy: what like 2008 crooked tv Phil?
[2017-03-05 05:10:20 UTC] wilkie1992: y yacherdy?
[2017-03-05 05:10:37 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Nothing wrong with his switch he had it unplug and uncharged so he wouldn't have to play Zelda
[2017-03-05 05:10:54 UTC] yacherdy: @wilkie1992 I don't know I could see Phil lashing out or one of the mods lashing out..I've seen it happen
[2017-03-05 05:11:07 UTC] yacherdy: but looks like you survived TriHard
[2017-03-05 05:11:15 UTC] beat43210: I doubt that happened
[2017-03-05 05:11:30 UTC] thousand_dollar_ragequit: #ifappedwithphil
[2017-03-05 05:11:35 UTC] stormforcegamer: I don't know what to say Phil but maybe a PC restart & even uninstalling & reinstalling OBS could help. I'm probably wrong as I know nothing about streaming software.
[2017-03-05 05:11:41 UTC] yacherdy: Blaster Master on the NES Kreygasm
[2017-03-05 05:11:43 UTC] guinesspie: Does Nintendo take 30% of your earnings on YT?
[2017-03-05 05:11:52 UTC] beat43210: Nah they take 100%
[2017-03-05 05:11:56 UTC] lorienawim: he cant upload zelda gameplay to youtube without a partner. as we have seen today, his main priority is still youtube..
[2017-03-05 05:11:57 UTC] beat43210: If you are not protected
[2017-03-05 05:12:02 UTC] yacherdy: that's why ANgry Joe is....angry,
[2017-03-05 05:12:09 UTC] muttogamer: Phil won't uninstall and reinstall a program. Thats too far involved in troubleshooting.
[2017-03-05 05:12:16 UTC] guinesspie: How do get protected?
[2017-03-05 05:12:20 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: Phil should start his own business like Pandalee but sell his natural hair grease.
[2017-03-05 05:12:22 UTC] beat43210: If you are not managed by another company
[2017-03-05 05:12:27 UTC] yacherdy: EleGiggle
[2017-03-05 05:12:30 UTC] wilkie1992: i dont mind im not being a dick its hard to show humor over text u know im not being being but im having the crk
[2017-03-05 05:12:32 UTC] beat43210: Basically get managed under a company
[2017-03-05 05:12:53 UTC] guinesspie: So if your under machinima for example, what happens?
[2017-03-05 05:13:11 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Personally wanna see him get Winnebago go on street fighter tour and film his trip on the road
[2017-03-05 05:13:11 UTC] beat43210: They tell Nintendo that he is under fair use
[2017-03-05 05:13:13 UTC] guinesspie: Say Im with mashitima and upload a BoW playthough
[2017-03-05 05:13:14 UTC] yacherdy: @wilkie1992 Oh I don't care about what you said at all I'm just saying sometimes you'll get banned

[2017-03-05 05:14:52 UTC] yacherdy: alright no worries @wilkie1992
[2017-03-05 05:14:53 UTC] lvlpower: Why can Phil just share video games with panda Lee? :/
[2017-03-05 05:15:09 UTC] guinesspie: thanks for the response
[2017-03-05 05:15:11 UTC] beat43210: @guinesspie mashitima will be like "it's ok nitendo back off"
[2017-03-05 05:15:19 UTC] guinesspie: I wonder why Nintendo do it?
[2017-03-05 05:15:21 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: I sent Phil bits and never unbanned me on twitter even when i asked him to. be careful @wilkie1992
[2017-03-05 05:15:22 UTC] yacherdy: Anyone got the Buffalo Classic SNES controller?
[2017-03-05 05:15:23 UTC] beat43210: If they go after him still mashitima will protect him
[2017-03-05 05:15:28 UTC] wilkie1992: he knows the way i am the mods dont but if i do get banned i know phil would change that
[2017-03-05 05:15:31 UTC] lorienawim: in essence: till he is partnered, switch will be "bricked"..
[2017-03-05 05:15:32 UTC] guinesspie: I mean they cant gain much from it, theyre a multibillion dollar company
[2017-03-05 05:15:41 UTC] beat43210: You wanna know why
[2017-03-05 05:15:50 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: why

[2017-03-05 05:16:26 UTC] guinesspie: Ive heard Nintendo America are really good but Nintendo Japan is notorious for that shit
[2017-03-05 05:16:31 UTC] beat43210: Studies have shown it leads to better sales
[2017-03-05 05:16:35 UTC] guinesspie: They just Pearl Harbour smaller channels
[2017-03-05 05:16:40 UTC] guinesspie: seems dumb to me

[2017-03-05 05:17:18 UTC] lvlpower: If panda lee is a gamer and Phil wanted to spend more time with his gf just share the controller
[2017-03-05 05:17:18 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I want to see that Nintendo park in Japan
[2017-03-05 05:17:35 UTC] beat43210: Glad they can't do shit with streaming
[2017-03-05 05:17:43 UTC] guinesspie: I tried watching Panda Lee videos and couldnt do it

[2017-03-05 05:17:55 UTC] beat43210: If they banned Zelda for example on twitch they would be fucked
[2017-03-05 05:17:57 UTC] guinesspie: I got into Phil because of the TIHYDP and I just love the saltiness of it all

[2017-03-05 05:23:23 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @kingofhypocrisy how was he a hater ?
[2017-03-05 05:23:23 UTC] wilkie1992: salesman
[2017-03-05 05:23:34 UTC] yacherdy: not sure what you're getting at vidar, wilkie is a legit fan
[2017-03-05 05:23:47 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: how would you know yacherdy

[2017-03-05 05:23:53 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: becaus he claims to be?
[2017-03-05 05:23:55 UTC] codenameone: @BusinessDude Big deal. Rambo was the biggest draw of the production anyway.
[2017-03-05 05:24:01 UTC] wilkie1992: vidar i am bud
[2017-03-05 05:24:04 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: @KyLastOutLaw606 Rambo got all the good jokes in Project 7 and took all the attention from Phil. That's hater behavior if I ever saw it
[2017-03-05 05:24:08 UTC] businessdude: not really.
[2017-03-05 05:24:09 UTC] muttogamer: I would want a bigger cut too if I had to spend a few hours a weekend driving to Phil's, using my gas, my car, and receining a fraction of what the video made in revenue
[2017-03-05 05:24:13 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I think the whole sope selling thing in ireland souind a bit fishy
[2017-03-05 05:24:23 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: If you lived out of state gotta pay for gas and meal to go see your friend help him on YouTube , how was he a bad guy? Did Phil ever come to Ny to see John Rambo ?
[2017-03-05 05:24:33 UTC] lvlpower: I would wantedntom
[2017-03-05 05:24:38 UTC] businessdude: phil made john rambo have a youtube presence. and yet rambo wanted more money
[2017-03-05 05:24:38 UTC] beat43210: He can't too busy working
[2017-03-05 05:24:40 UTC] yacherdy: well I've seen him on here before, never said shit about Phil...of course he could be hating him outside of the chat but that's not for me to say because I don't know for sure and I don't care enough to
[2017-03-05 05:24:56 UTC] wilkie1992: vidar i dont need u to believe me man but i am who i am lad if i was a cunt id side with the cunts sok fuck them
[2017-03-05 05:25:00 UTC] beat43210: He's not shitting on Phil end of story
[2017-03-05 05:25:09 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: Rambo tried to put DSP outta bizness with that video, sammy told me so
[2017-03-05 05:25:14 UTC] beat43210: They just haven't kept in touch
[2017-03-05 05:25:17 UTC] yacherdy: sammy EleGiggle
[2017-03-05 05:25:19 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Did Phil ever once go see John Rambo in NY?
[2017-03-05 05:25:21 UTC] lvlpower: I would want to play games but not for a living :/
[2017-03-05 05:25:22 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: but why tell that fib about selling leanna soap in ireland that sounds just so unbelievable
[2017-03-05 05:25:30 UTC] beat43210: He can't afford it
[2017-03-05 05:25:37 UTC] businessdude: @lvlpower phill has a lower back problem. he cant drive
[2017-03-05 05:25:40 UTC] beat43210: Of course he didn't
[2017-03-05 05:25:47 UTC] codenameone: @mr_vidar_viking What could he *possibly* gain by lying about it?
[2017-03-05 05:25:51 UTC] yacherdy: lvl it's doable but not the way Phil does it...takes the joy right out of it
[2017-03-05 05:25:55 UTC] wilkie1992: i did im not lying i sent her a message 2 years ago
[2017-03-05 05:26:02 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: To make himself seem relevant

[2017-03-05 05:26:18 UTC] beat43210: While we are here
[2017-03-05 05:26:26 UTC] beat43210: Let's predict who he's gonna join with
[2017-03-05 05:26:31 UTC] wilkie1992: i do not need to be relevant bud i could not care less
[2017-03-05 05:26:42 UTC] lvlpower: @businessdude I don't have a back problem of

[2017-03-05 05:26:59 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: Stop bullying him dood
[2017-03-05 05:27:12 UTC] businessdude: @lvlpower not you. Phil does. that's why he never travel to see john.
[2017-03-05 05:27:22 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I didn't know she had made soap for that long even
[2017-03-05 05:27:34 UTC] yacherdy: she started february 2015
[2017-03-05 05:27:36 UTC] lorienawim: @vidar: you seem to take this too seriously man. even if he is lying, there's no harm in it..
[2017-03-05 05:27:44 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @businessdude if you had serious back problem you wouldn't be driving to best-buy a Nintendo switch Kappa
[2017-03-05 05:27:45 UTC] yacherdy: same with Phil's patreon
[2017-03-05 05:27:50 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: John wuz just jealous, he wanted to BE Phil!
[2017-03-05 05:27:52 UTC] businessdude: I heard she works at target. true?
[2017-03-05 05:27:57 UTC] lvlpower: @businessdude ok I'll have no idea what I'll do if my back was mess up
[2017-03-05 05:28:12 UTC] businessdude: @KyLastOutLaw606
[2017-03-05 05:28:13 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: No harm true. But I just don't want to take such a outragous claim at face value
[2017-03-05 05:28:17 UTC] wilkie1992: its ok im not the one to care wat people think all i know i have been a fan for years and tryed to help him in the past if u dont believe me thats fine but it is wat it is
[2017-03-05 05:28:24 UTC] businessdude: he said his best buy is near his home
[2017-03-05 05:28:32 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: that is true
[2017-03-05 05:28:39 UTC] beat43210: He said he can drive locally
[2017-03-05 05:28:52 UTC] beat43210: But not on highways/extended period
[2017-03-05 05:29:00 UTC] muttogamer: unless it's to work a job
[2017-03-05 05:29:10 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: ^
[2017-03-05 05:29:20 UTC] lvlpower: Phil said tomorrow is going to return the Nintendo switch refund
[2017-03-05 05:29:28 UTC] beat43210: Good on him
[2017-03-05 05:29:29 UTC] yacherdy: Wherever Leanna works it doesn't matter because at least she's working.
[2017-03-05 05:29:41 UTC] beat43210: Nitendo is gonna go bankrupt anyways
[2017-03-05 05:29:58 UTC] businessdude: how did the switch do sales wise?
[2017-03-05 05:29:59 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: At least Leanna working i give her props not sitting around doing nothin
[2017-03-05 05:30:07 UTC] lvlpower: hopefully Phil just buy have to Zelda Beath of the Wild on Wii u
[2017-03-05 05:30:12 UTC] beat43210: No idea @businessdude
[2017-03-05 05:30:14 UTC] lorienawim: as i said before, there is no point in investing in a new switch, if he can't upload zelda videos on youtube without a partner
[2017-03-05 05:30:17 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: 599 us dollars
[2017-03-05 05:30:23 UTC] lorienawim: returning it will be a wise choice
[2017-03-05 05:30:25 UTC] beat43210: WTF
[2017-03-05 05:30:29 UTC] yacherdy: Leanna has her haters but she's working and does a hobby as a "business" on the side
[2017-03-05 05:30:32 UTC] beat43210: yup wise choice
[2017-03-05 05:30:43 UTC] businessdude: who thinks the switch will fail?
[2017-03-05 05:30:44 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I can't wait until Nintendo bankrupt and they finally start putting their games on psn, Xbox,PC
[2017-03-05 05:30:48 UTC] beat43210: Me
[2017-03-05 05:30:58 UTC] beat43210: You know what
[2017-03-05 05:31:06 UTC] businessdude: I blame iwata for taknig nintendo to the casual route.
[2017-03-05 05:31:08 UTC] beat43210: Maybe invest shares into PS4
[2017-03-05 05:31:14 UTC] lvlpower: %5 might be ok
[2017-03-05 05:31:17 UTC] wilkie1992: i dont think so
[2017-03-05 05:31:54 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: When Nintendo goes bankrupt their finally going to release a sequel Mario porno parody
[2017-03-05 05:31:59 UTC] wilkie1992: i wish phil would do more retro games
[2017-03-05 05:32:00 UTC] beat43210: Lol
[2017-03-05 05:32:06 UTC] lvlpower: for only one release Zelda then ev

[2017-03-05 05:32:18 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: there
[2017-03-05 05:32:22 UTC] lvlpower: All the customers employers have to wait until Mario release
[2017-03-05 05:32:32 UTC] beat43210: The problem with Nintendo is that they are in the middle of a crisis
[2017-03-05 05:32:38 UTC] lorienawim: i don't see switch as a viable gaming platform without third party support. only romantics like us 30+ years old will buy it - just to collect dust..
[2017-03-05 05:32:39 UTC] yacherdy: Gradius TriHard
[2017-03-05 05:32:45 UTC] lvlpower: :/
[2017-03-05 05:32:48 UTC] wilkie1992: lol
[2017-03-05 05:32:58 UTC] beat43210: But hey it might even be vintage

[2017-03-05 05:33:04 UTC] yacherdy: Blaster Master TriHard
[2017-03-05 05:33:19 UTC] wilkie1992: i wish he play pokemon snap
[2017-03-05 05:33:25 UTC] codenameone: That's basically the bulk of Nintendo's consumer base; nostalgia dudes who grew up with Nintendo.
[2017-03-05 05:33:32 UTC] yacherdy: lol Pokemon Snap was my shit back in the day
[2017-03-05 05:33:34 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: Phil should do a 3 man podcast with lowti3rgod and Reviewtechusa
[2017-03-05 05:33:38 UTC] lvlpower: pretty after Zelda Beath of the Wild what after that :/
[2017-03-05 05:33:40 UTC] yacherdy: I snapped the shit out of Charzard
[2017-03-05 05:33:47 UTC] beat43210: Not happening
[2017-03-05 05:33:52 UTC] lorienawim: @CodenameOne : exactly
[2017-03-05 05:33:54 UTC] businessdude: the way nintendo is going, soon sony will monopolize the gaming industry.
[2017-03-05 05:33:56 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: you really seem to be a LTG fan kiungofhypocricy
[2017-03-05 05:34:16 UTC] codenameone: LTG's a funny dude. Just needs to chill.
[2017-03-05 05:34:16 UTC] beat43210: Nah a sons of Kagima fan
[2017-03-05 05:34:22 UTC] wilkie1992: omg nintendo why not make snap again yacherdy its such a easy game but
[2017-03-05 05:34:26 UTC] lvlpower: what players are just going to keep playing Zelda until Mario releases that's ridiculous
[2017-03-05 05:34:37 UTC] businessdude: mario kart
[2017-03-05 05:34:39 UTC] businessdude: samus
[2017-03-05 05:34:39 UTC] beat43210: Basically
[2017-03-05 05:34:40 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: @mr_vidar_viking He's entertaining, people in the FGC even said he's the Black version of Phil.
[2017-03-05 05:34:43 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah Snap was great...Stadium was good too.
[2017-03-05 05:34:57 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: so he was the one who coined the term Blacksydephil?
[2017-03-05 05:35:00 UTC] yacherdy: didn't play Hey Pikachu much
[2017-03-05 05:35:06 UTC] codenameone: DarkerSydePhil was one.
[2017-03-05 05:35:12 UTC] businessdude: does the switch has camara lends?
[2017-03-05 05:35:23 UTC] beat43210: Maybe
[2017-03-05 05:35:28 UTC] beat43210: I skipped the switch
[2017-03-05 05:35:33 UTC] yacherdy: Unfortunately after the N64 my love for Nintendo stopped and I was playing PS2 most of the time.
[2017-03-05 05:35:34 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: @mr_vidar_viking Not him exactly, some people in the FGC
[2017-03-05 05:35:47 UTC] wilkie1992: stadium was unreal in ireland we didnt get hey pikachu was only in usa and japan
[2017-03-05 05:35:48 UTC] beat43210: Well the FGC hate Phil
[2017-03-05 05:35:53 UTC] beat43210: I think
[2017-03-05 05:35:56 UTC] yacherdy: ah
[2017-03-05 05:35:57 UTC] beat43210: Don't quote me on it
[2017-03-05 05:36:04 UTC] businessdude: for me it was the gamecube. when the wii was release, i was like "im done with you , nintendo"
[2017-03-05 05:36:06 UTC] lvlpower: yea Nintendo wI'll survive after lunch however that pretty much Nintendo switch is going downhill
[2017-03-05 05:36:14 UTC] toooldforgaming: If Phil wants I can show him in 10 minutes how to record video at 1080p for youtube and also stream at 720p
[2017-03-05 05:36:21 UTC] toooldforgaming: ObsStudio does both
[2017-03-05 05:36:21 UTC] wilkie1992: im glad it looked shit i seen pbg do a review on it lol
[2017-03-05 05:36:22 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Only reason people buy Nintendo is their exclusives and that's that
[2017-03-05 05:36:23 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: Phil should do a vlogging series where he shows up to FGC events to see their reaction to him. It would get good vies
[2017-03-05 05:36:24 UTC] yacherdy: gamecube I had but only played a few games on....didn't get wii until a couple years after
[2017-03-05 05:36:32 UTC] beat43210: Email it to him @toooldforgaming
[2017-03-05 05:36:36 UTC] beat43210: Or go to his twitter
[2017-03-05 05:36:48 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: do the FGC even remember phil at this point?
[2017-03-05 05:36:48 UTC] lvlpower: @kylastoutlaw606 yelp
[2017-03-05 05:36:52 UTC] toooldforgaming: He's blocked me on twitter cause I reposted one guy once
[2017-03-05 05:36:58 UTC] toooldforgaming: So *shrug*
[2017-03-05 05:36:58 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: @mr_vidar_viking Yes
[2017-03-05 05:37:00 UTC] wilkie1992: i hacked my wii and wii u jacherdy i got breath of the wild 3 days early
[2017-03-05 05:37:05 UTC] beat43210: Some of them still do remember phill
[2017-03-05 05:37:13 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @toooldforgaming if it's more than 5 steps you gotta be there actually do it for Phil
[2017-03-05 05:37:16 UTC] yacherdy: @wilkie1992 well damn lol
[2017-03-05 05:37:16 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: Most of the old school players do
[2017-03-05 05:37:33 UTC] beat43210: Check his competitions he took part in
[2017-03-05 05:37:36 UTC] businessdude: the fgc is bitter at phil because phill "made it' on youtube
[2017-03-05 05:37:37 UTC] toooldforgaming: It takes like 10 ssteps
[2017-03-05 05:37:40 UTC] beat43210: He did pretty well on a national level
[2017-03-05 05:37:44 UTC] beat43210: Like top 8
[2017-03-05 05:37:48 UTC] wilkie1992: yeah the game was release in spain on wednesday i was able to get the files
[2017-03-05 05:38:10 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: Phil needs to get his revenge against Alex Valle for calling him a scrub all those years ago
[2017-03-05 05:38:11 UTC] yacherdy: you sneaky bastard lol
[2017-03-05 05:38:17 UTC] wilkie1992: u know u can get a wii u emulator now dont ya
[2017-03-05 05:38:23 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Like I said want to see Phil get Winnebago and travel USA on a tour playing street fighter
[2017-03-05 05:38:23 UTC] beat43210: Nah he doesn't need to
[2017-03-05 05:38:25 UTC] wilkie1992: lol i know
[2017-03-05 05:38:38 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: Yes he does need to
[2017-03-05 05:38:45 UTC] beat43210: It would be cool
[2017-03-05 05:38:49 UTC] yacherdy: wii u emulator? for me I kind of have a rule, I only emulate consoles that are discontinued
[2017-03-05 05:38:50 UTC] beat43210: But that would mean he can't stream
[2017-03-05 05:39:02 UTC] toooldforgaming: I seriously wonder why he won't listen about OBSstudio
[2017-03-05 05:39:08 UTC] codenameone: @KyLastOutLaw606 That would be neat. But Phil's pretty much done with SF.
[2017-03-05 05:39:12 UTC] beat43210: He talked about it once
[2017-03-05 05:39:13 UTC] yacherdy: I don't feel bad playing a rom for a snes game but Wii U or 3DS is more touchy
[2017-03-05 05:39:17 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: @KyLastOutLaw606 I live in a Winnebago down by the river!
[2017-03-05 05:39:18 UTC] toooldforgaming: It's so simple to have a capture and a stream
[2017-03-05 05:39:34 UTC] wilkie1992: i have a wii u but having the emulator on pc and using a ps4 controller so handy
[2017-03-05 05:39:34 UTC] beat43210: @toooldforgaming he's a bit of a thick head it's hard to change his mind
[2017-03-05 05:39:38 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @toooldforgaming it's just to much for him to understand like I said u gotta be there to help him
[2017-03-05 05:39:47 UTC] beat43210: But seriously what's different between obs and obs studio?
[2017-03-05 05:40:01 UTC] beat43210: I might consider using it
[2017-03-05 05:40:09 UTC] yacherdy: yeah @wilkie1992 I use Dolphin for the GameCube games...looking to get a GameCube clone controller for the PC
[2017-03-05 05:40:10 UTC] toooldforgaming: OBS studio allows you to have a stream and save a local recording
[2017-03-05 05:40:11 UTC] lvlpower: I'm fine with the owneding the Nintendo 3ds
[2017-03-05 05:40:21 UTC] toooldforgaming: And both can be different resolutions
[2017-03-05 05:40:23 UTC] wilkie1992: the emulator is called cemu if ur intrested
[2017-03-05 05:40:24 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @kingofhypocrisy it be pretty funny see him vlog going tournaments on road in Winnebago
[2017-03-05 05:40:33 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: yeah it would
[2017-03-05 05:40:36 UTC] toooldforgaming: I know because I use OBS Studio and it's a cakewalk
[2017-03-05 05:40:38 UTC] beat43210: Doesn't that put more pressure on computers CPU?
[2017-03-05 05:40:48 UTC] yacherdy: Alright thanks if i ever consider it in the future I'll take note of it
[2017-03-05 05:40:54 UTC] toooldforgaming: No, just save the local recording with Nvenc
[2017-03-05 05:41:01 UTC] toooldforgaming: Takes no extra CPU power
[2017-03-05 05:41:01 UTC] wilkie1992: yacherdy u need to hack a wii bud u can get gamecube and wii back ups for free
[2017-03-05 05:41:06 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: What kind of Cpu get any way?

[2017-03-05 05:42:06 UTC] wilkie1992: more
[2017-03-05 05:42:08 UTC] toooldforgaming: You can build a streaming/capture PC for about $600
[2017-03-05 05:42:20 UTC] yacherdy: might have to reapply thermal to my cpu...getting 85 Celsius on heavy load...hmmm.
[2017-03-05 05:42:23 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Phil needed the 8core Intel for his streams and video editing
[2017-03-05 05:42:23 UTC] kingofhypocrisy: Well he did pay 3k for it, so it shoud be powerful
[2017-03-05 05:42:34 UTC] toooldforgaming: He has a 6 core intel I think
[2017-03-05 05:42:36 UTC] yacherdy: @wilkie1992 holy crap

[2017-03-05 05:44:18 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: later dodgystory1992
[2017-03-05 05:44:29 UTC] yacherdy: NotLikeThis
[2017-03-05 05:44:31 UTC] lvlpower: I'm going to check out Phil Twitter !twitter
[2017-03-05 05:44:43 UTC] codenameone: @TooOldForGaming Well you could ass kiss AND give him suggestions.
[2017-03-05 05:44:44 UTC] lvlpower: brb
[2017-03-05 05:44:55 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: IF you put OBS studio in the subject he will probably read it if it is good advice
[2017-03-05 05:45:00 UTC] yacherdy: lol don't ass kiss FailFish
[2017-03-05 05:45:05 UTC] toooldforgaming: You can't help people learn how to do something if you kiss their ass at the same time, they learn literally nothing
[2017-03-05 05:45:09 UTC] toooldforgaming: That's a fact
[2017-03-05 05:45:12 UTC] yacherdy: thats true

[2017-03-05 05:46:01 UTC] wilkie1992: right night night
[2017-03-05 05:46:35 UTC] toooldforgaming: So what mod can I talk to in order to give them all the steps to OBS studio for both a stream and a capture?
[2017-03-05 05:46:48 UTC] toooldforgaming: Or I can post it here even
[2017-03-05 05:46:55 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Is Phil getting back on tonight?
[2017-03-05 05:47:02 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: just send him a email darksydephil@hotmail.com
[2017-03-05 05:47:08 UTC] lvlpower: ok well I check out Phil Twitter I think he finished for today I give Phil one more hour
[2017-03-05 05:47:17 UTC] toooldforgaming: I'm not sending him a damn email, because I don't know his damn setup
[2017-03-05 05:47:26 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Lol
[2017-03-05 05:47:27 UTC] toooldforgaming: Really dude
[2017-03-05 05:47:35 UTC] toooldforgaming: I'm not psychic
[2017-03-05 05:47:45 UTC] codenameone: Well without knowing his setup it's impossible to improve it whether you email him or post it here.
[2017-03-05 05:47:56 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: That is true
[2017-03-05 05:48:09 UTC] toooldforgaming: Because if I tell a mod how it's done, said mod will learn how OBS studio works
[2017-03-05 05:48:15 UTC] lvlpower: I'm not sure if Phil coming back or not :/
[2017-03-05 05:48:18 UTC] toooldforgaming: And then said mod can help phil if he has a problem
[2017-03-05 05:48:27 UTC] codenameone: The mods don't know his setup either though?
[2017-03-05 05:48:30 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @toooldforgaming just don't worry about it if he wants to grow his twich & YouTube his gotta put little time in it for his self by helping his self
[2017-03-05 05:48:38 UTC] soulrider95: He needs to dust his room for one
[2017-03-05 05:48:41 UTC] codenameone: @lvlpower Stream is over for tonight.
[2017-03-05 05:48:47 UTC] lvlpower: ok
[2017-03-05 05:48:50 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: WelL I suppose he have a direct capture setup through some hdmi stuff BUT you would have to ask him anyways.
[2017-03-05 05:48:55 UTC] toooldforgaming: Anyways I'll explain like 95% of the setup process here
[2017-03-05 05:49:05 UTC] lvlpower: Thanks @codenameone
[2017-03-05 05:49:11 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: WEll just send it to him on e-mail it would make more sense
[2017-03-05 05:49:12 UTC] toooldforgaming: Fire up OBS studio, setup all your sources etc
[2017-03-05 05:49:16 UTC] codenameone: @lvlpower It's good.
[2017-03-05 05:49:22 UTC] toooldforgaming: Click the settings tab
[2017-03-05 05:49:48 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @soulrider95 yea he really needs to clean that up and unplug the 360,ps3
[2017-03-05 05:50:12 UTC] toooldforgaming: Click the video tab, make sure base is set to 1080p, and output is set to scaled down 1280x720, pick Lanczos filter
[2017-03-05 05:50:27 UTC] toooldforgaming: Click over to audio, set up sources
[2017-03-05 05:50:32 UTC] codenameone: His PS3 will probably explode if he unplugs it. It's already got HDMI issues.
[2017-03-05 05:50:44 UTC] lvlpower: @codenameone I keep on buffer and Skip's terrible it might be my internet it's probably slow
[2017-03-05 05:50:45 UTC] toooldforgaming: Click the output tab, click the top dropdown and set it to advanced mode
[2017-03-05 05:51:12 UTC] toooldforgaming: For streaming if he wants to keep using CPU just set up his bitrates for output there
[2017-03-05 05:51:18 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: You can do so much for Phil if he want his channel to grow he really needs to help him self and put time into his channel
[2017-03-05 05:51:22 UTC] codenameone: @lvlpower I get buffer issues sometimes too. Mostly when I'm Skyping and watching the stream at the same time.
[2017-03-05 05:51:43 UTC] yacherdy: My internet is very good but Twitch always seems to fuck up for me.
[2017-03-05 05:51:50 UTC] toooldforgaming: Click over to the recording tab, set up a recording path, set recording format as .flv in case OBS ever crashes
[2017-03-05 05:52:02 UTC] toooldforgaming: Click encoder, set to NVENC h.264
[2017-03-05 05:52:10 UTC] lvlpower: @codenameone Thanks Comcast for bad dspSurpriseddsp dspNothing services
[2017-03-05 05:52:15 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I only get 3mbps down and 1 up I would love start putting time into a YouTube channel
[2017-03-05 05:52:27 UTC] toooldforgaming: Click rate control down below, set to CQP
[2017-03-05 05:52:35 UTC] codenameone: @lvlpower dspWowdude
[2017-03-05 05:52:35 UTC] toooldforgaming: Set CQP to 17
[2017-03-05 05:52:42 UTC] yacherdy: 3 down and 1 up?
[2017-03-05 05:52:46 UTC] toooldforgaming: Set preset to low latency high quality
[2017-03-05 05:52:55 UTC] toooldforgaming: Set profile to high, level to auto
[2017-03-05 05:53:07 UTC] toooldforgaming: Enable two pass encoding, set B-Frames to 4
[2017-03-05 05:53:20 UTC] toooldforgaming: And done, you can now stream and record at the same time with different resolutions
[2017-03-05 05:53:24 UTC] lvlpower: @codenameone shit happens I wish Comcast give me notifications and let me know what is their problem like that they could fix their problem
[2017-03-05 05:54:00 UTC] codenameone: @lvlpower Comcast is huge ass. I once followed a Youtuber whose internet was Comcast and he railed against them all the time.
[2017-03-05 05:54:04 UTC] toooldforgaming: Oh and click over to the advanced tab
[2017-03-05 05:54:17 UTC] toooldforgaming: Set renderer to OpenGL if you don't have DX11
[2017-03-05 05:54:19 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Phil so scared of a keyboard he won't play games on his beautiful machine I wish someone will tell him you could use Xbox controller
[2017-03-05 05:54:44 UTC] toooldforgaming: Color format NV12, YUV color space of 709, YUV Range to partial
[2017-03-05 05:55:06 UTC] toooldforgaming: If video is washed out (Which I doubt since 709 is full range) set color range to full
[2017-03-05 05:55:17 UTC] codenameone: @KyLastOutLaw606 He played Skyrim on PC with an Xbox controller. His deal is that he allegedly can't record, stream, AND game at the same time on his PC.
[2017-03-05 05:55:25 UTC] lvlpower: @codenameone I just feel like Comcast never tell us the customers updates and give us feedback what's happening but now it's all a secret secrets
[2017-03-05 05:55:33 UTC] toooldforgaming: I stream, record and game at the same time
[2017-03-05 05:55:40 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: are you high or something @toooldforgaming?=
[2017-03-05 05:55:44 UTC] toooldforgaming: My PC isn't much better than his is
[2017-03-05 05:55:46 UTC] codenameone: @lvlpower Thankfully I've never had to use Comcast for anything.
[2017-03-05 05:55:50 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @codenameone yea you can lol
[2017-03-05 05:56:10 UTC] codenameone: @KingOfHypocrisy According to Phil he can't. Ask him.
[2017-03-05 05:56:21 UTC] yacherdy: yeah I use Xbox One controller on my PC for the appropriate games, it works great.
[2017-03-05 05:56:28 UTC] lvlpower: @codenameone that good thumb up
[2017-03-05 05:56:49 UTC] toooldforgaming: Phil has two PC's, that second PC can also stream/record easily
[2017-03-05 05:57:11 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah that doens't depend on the pc at all Kappa
[2017-03-05 05:57:16 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: When I first start playing battlefield 4 on the PC I used my Xbox 360 controller for the moment and use my mouse for the shooting
[2017-03-05 05:57:28 UTC] codenameone: Maybe he just doesn't *like* PC gaming?
[2017-03-05 05:57:30 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Movement ...
[2017-03-05 05:57:30 UTC] lvlpower: @codenameone Well I'm off to sleep later
[2017-03-05 05:57:45 UTC] yacherdy: well he shouldn't have bought a PC then lol
[2017-03-05 05:57:46 UTC] toooldforgaming: Output your PC video via HDMI into capture card, use voicemeeter banana to run your sound through to the second pc, voila streaming with second PC and gaming with the first one
[2017-03-05 05:57:47 UTC] codenameone: @lvlpower See you later. It's mad late for me, too.
[2017-03-05 05:58:08 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @codenameone it's just Phil he makes thing hard lol
[2017-03-05 05:58:21 UTC] lvlpower: peace out dsp fans unlit Sunday
[2017-03-05 05:58:34 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: good night
[2017-03-05 05:58:35 UTC] codenameone: @KingOfHypocrisy Lol yeah, I guess so.
[2017-03-05 05:58:36 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: The PC his got he can record and stream at the same time
[2017-03-05 05:58:57 UTC] toooldforgaming: Almost any PC can if it's got a video card
[2017-03-05 05:59:21 UTC] toooldforgaming: That includes ones built into CPU;s
[2017-03-05 05:59:28 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Don't he have like a 980 ti?
[2017-03-05 05:59:49 UTC] toooldforgaming: If he does he has zero excuses why he can't stream and record
[2017-03-05 05:59:56 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I think the laptop he is using is really weak, and old
[2017-03-05 06:00:03 UTC] toooldforgaming: That has a very powerful transcoding chip
[2017-03-05 06:00:16 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: But his desktop should be pretty decent
[2017-03-05 06:00:19 UTC] yacherdy: I' haven't *really* tried streaming yet...can my 970 and i5 4690K stream 1080p 60fps?
[2017-03-05 06:00:30 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: If Phil smart he use two TV as monitors for his PC
[2017-03-05 06:00:48 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: So he can sit on the couch
[2017-03-05 06:01:09 UTC] chloeiscool1992: sure YaCherdy
[2017-03-05 06:01:15 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah I don't understand why he don't do that,. I am on my pc now and I am laying comfortably ion my bed
[2017-03-05 06:01:19 UTC] chloeiscool1992: and no.... 1080i
[2017-03-05 06:01:23 UTC] chloeiscool1992: eww
[2017-03-05 06:02:04 UTC] yacherdy: latency would seem to be an issue playing PC games on a TV
[2017-03-05 06:02:23 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: nah new tv have a pretty decent refreshrate
[2017-03-05 06:02:25 UTC] chloeiscool1992: not really
[2017-03-05 06:02:27 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: with low latency
[2017-03-05 06:02:28 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I mean it's ok for gaming but you want the best out of your games playing on a PC you gotta use a monitor 144hz
[2017-03-05 06:02:36 UTC] lorienawim: @vidar: i guess you are not married. these "design choices" are usually vetoed by your SO
[2017-03-05 06:02:40 UTC] chloeiscool1992: 144hz is overkill
[2017-03-05 06:02:43 UTC] yacherdy: well I guess I wouldn't play CS GO and Overwatch on a TV
[2017-03-05 06:02:51 UTC] chloeiscool1992: unless you're playing MLG CSGI
[2017-03-05 06:02:55 UTC] chloeiscool1992: CSGO
[2017-03-05 06:03:13 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @yacherdy it be fine for Phil playing PC games on a TV he wouldn't notice
[2017-03-05 06:03:39 UTC] yacherdy: I play on a 1080p monitor that's only 60hz (although I overclocked it to 74hz, not that that matters) and it works great
[2017-03-05 06:03:41 UTC] toooldforgaming: PC has no latency to TV
[2017-03-05 06:03:44 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @yacherdy yea u don't wanna play those types on a TV lmao he be fine playing single player games
[2017-03-05 06:03:46 UTC] toooldforgaming: That's bullcrap
[2017-03-05 06:03:47 UTC] yacherdy: well yeah phil wouldn't give a shit
[2017-03-05 06:04:01 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: A pc can offer everything more superior than a console I don't see why you should use something else if it isn't like a exclusive title
[2017-03-05 06:04:10 UTC] toooldforgaming: I build mini-pc's to use as home entertainment systems all the time
[2017-03-05 06:04:12 UTC] chloeiscool1992: phil recorded CSGO with a camera
[2017-03-05 06:04:15 UTC] toooldforgaming: There is no lag between PC and TV
[2017-03-05 06:04:21 UTC] lorienawim: his girlfriend wouldnt be OK by Phil using two TVs for gaming
[2017-03-05 06:04:22 UTC] chloeiscool1992: I dont think he cares about CSGO :P
[2017-03-05 06:04:38 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: he can use one tv at a time lmao
[2017-03-05 06:04:45 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: My first PC I ever built guys was amd fx 8150 first 8 core
[2017-03-05 06:04:56 UTC] toooldforgaming: This shit isn't rocket science, it's building PC's
[2017-03-05 06:04:57 UTC] chloeiscool1992: I got an fx-8350
[2017-03-05 06:04:59 UTC] chloeiscool1992: ;P
[2017-03-05 06:05:06 UTC] toooldforgaming: I used to build server racks, home PC's are a sinch
[2017-03-05 06:05:11 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Have one TV for his twich chat and the other for his game
[2017-03-05 06:05:34 UTC] yacherdy: well tell Phil that @TooOldForGaming
[2017-03-05 06:05:39 UTC] chloeiscool1992: eewww

[2017-03-05 06:05:50 UTC] yacherdy: He's the one that "built PC's for a hobby"
[2017-03-05 06:05:58 UTC] chloeiscool1992: server racks are dirty as fuck
[2017-03-05 06:06:05 UTC] chloeiscool1992: like all that dust
[2017-03-05 06:06:07 UTC] chloeiscool1992: :P
[2017-03-05 06:06:26 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @toooldforgaming never build anything for Phil unless u want to be like the last guy
[2017-03-05 06:06:39 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: you usually have them in a room where dust doesn't accumulate with ac that have air filtration I would hope
[2017-03-05 06:06:49 UTC] chloeiscool1992: they dont
[2017-03-05 06:06:55 UTC] chloeiscool1992: not all businesses do
[2017-03-05 06:06:55 UTC] toooldforgaming: I tried to tell him, he just called me an "Immature little kid who knows nothing about computers"
[2017-03-05 06:07:03 UTC] yacherdy: lol
[2017-03-05 06:07:06 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: they do where I have seen them at least. ;)
[2017-03-05 06:07:09 UTC] toooldforgaming: Even though I posted a video showing how it's done
[2017-03-05 06:07:11 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @chloeiscool1992 we both know Phil never built pc's for hobby everyone knows
[2017-03-05 06:07:11 UTC] lorienawim: lol
[2017-03-05 06:07:20 UTC] toooldforgaming: He still said I was wrong, refused to listen
[2017-03-05 06:07:22 UTC] chloeiscool1992: well can I come work there :D
[2017-03-05 06:07:28 UTC] yacherdy: Anyone can build a pc...all they need is youtube vidios and voila
[2017-03-05 06:07:32 UTC] yacherdy: videos*
[2017-03-05 06:07:50 UTC] chloeiscool1992: LinusTechTips or CareyHolzman
[2017-03-05 06:07:51 UTC] chloeiscool1992: :P
[2017-03-05 06:08:11 UTC] toooldforgaming: Again, I can't teach Phil shit unless he drops the facade and is willing to work out the problem
[2017-03-05 06:08:14 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @yacherdy that's how I built my first PC it was a amd fx 8150 I wish I had ore money to build nice Intel rig
[2017-03-05 06:08:19 UTC] toooldforgaming: You can't kiss somebodies ass AND teach them at the same time
[2017-03-05 06:08:22 UTC] toooldforgaming: It's impossible
[2017-03-05 06:08:40 UTC] yacherdy: @KyLastOutLaw606 Same...I had my problems that occurred building it but it worked out good.
[2017-03-05 06:08:56 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I don't know why Phil needed a nice PC when didn't wanna edit his videos
[2017-03-05 06:09:24 UTC] toooldforgaming: Phils editing style all you need is a fast hard drive
[2017-03-05 06:09:38 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Lol
[2017-03-05 06:09:39 UTC] yacherdy: I want to upgrade soon to i7 6700K and 1080 but that'll be a ways off
[2017-03-05 06:10:01 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: you need a decent videocard for editing and some ram also, just putting a ssd in the computer isn't enough lol
[2017-03-05 06:10:16 UTC] yacherdy: Well, yeah...the ram.
[2017-03-05 06:10:17 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I want get me a i76900k or the new amaz ryzen 8 core once they get their problems fix
[2017-03-05 06:10:30 UTC] toooldforgaming: Um, I edit videos, and I've encoded videos for websites. I think I know about this shit bro
[2017-03-05 06:10:41 UTC] toooldforgaming: Phils editing you can do with just AVIDemux
[2017-03-05 06:10:48 UTC] yacherdy: Every time I put that CPU down I thought I was breaking the mobo lol
[2017-03-05 06:10:51 UTC] toooldforgaming: Set start, set end, export
[2017-03-05 06:10:55 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Well he is using Adobe premier pro
[2017-03-05 06:10:56 UTC] toooldforgaming: Just requires a fast HD
[2017-03-05 06:11:09 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: SSD only it does makes your programs load up faster and transfer data faster that's only thing it does
[2017-03-05 06:11:16 UTC] yacherdy: RAM is the key
[2017-03-05 06:11:22 UTC] toooldforgaming: Phil does not output his gameplay videos with premiere pro
[2017-03-05 06:11:24 UTC] yacherdy: and CPU
[2017-03-05 06:11:35 UTC] toooldforgaming: I guarantee he does not
[2017-03-05 06:11:37 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: no for that he uses obs studio as we all know
[2017-03-05 06:11:52 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @toooldforgaming he will never do any editing
[2017-03-05 06:12:00 UTC] toooldforgaming: Phil uses OBS for capture, then cuts up clips with an MP4 clip editor
[2017-03-05 06:12:02 UTC] toooldforgaming: Then uploads
[2017-03-05 06:12:07 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Phil needs really put time in his channel
[2017-03-05 06:12:13 UTC] toooldforgaming: Takes literally minutes to edit clips that way
[2017-03-05 06:12:19 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: and the stuff he makes for KO gaming he does in Adobe premier pro I am pretty sure of it
[2017-03-05 06:12:31 UTC] toooldforgaming: The KO gaming stuff he does in premiere pro yes
[2017-03-05 06:12:35 UTC] toooldforgaming: I'm talking his gameplay videos
[2017-03-05 06:12:53 UTC] toooldforgaming: He just cuts up his OBS clips with AVIdemux
[2017-03-05 06:12:55 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Phil should gotten a MacBook Pro and gotten Final Cut Pro just save a monthly bill
[2017-03-05 06:12:55 UTC] yacherdy: I don't see Phil's channels lasting long enough for him to put any time into them
[2017-03-05 06:13:00 UTC] toooldforgaming: Or something like it, takes seconds
[2017-03-05 06:13:21 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Phil won't try anything new
[2017-03-05 06:13:25 UTC] toooldforgaming: There is no reason to own newer versions of premiere, just buy the last retail version
[2017-03-05 06:13:31 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: why not use vegas pro....the free version if you catch my drift
[2017-03-05 06:13:44 UTC] toooldforgaming: Unless you do lots of video effects editing, in which case you need after effects for such tools like Neat Video etc
[2017-03-05 06:13:48 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: The last one is for 2012 or something and cost ridiculosly much
[2017-03-05 06:13:49 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: like every other youtube
[2017-03-05 06:14:08 UTC] toooldforgaming: Vegas pro is shit, it washes out colors and makes terrible exports
[2017-03-05 06:14:16 UTC] yacherdy: That moment when Patrick Bateman drops the chainsaw on the hooker EleGiggle
[2017-03-05 06:14:27 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I wish Phil do more tho
[2017-03-05 06:14:34 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Feed me a straycat
[2017-03-05 06:14:44 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Like other videos then games
[2017-03-05 06:14:51 UTC] yacherdy: Need to return some video tapes...
[2017-03-05 06:14:53 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Mans needs another hobby
[2017-03-05 06:15:03 UTC] toooldforgaming: Again I do this shit in my sleep
[2017-03-05 06:15:46 UTC] lorienawim: key to survive in a fragmented market like youtube is to differentiate. losing revenue in a growing market is a telltale sign that there is something fundamentally wrong with your operations
[2017-03-05 06:15:46 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I don't know why the viewers wanted to donate him a new PC when he never use it for it was built to do
[2017-03-05 06:16:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: you have studied marketing I see lorienawim
[2017-03-05 06:16:11 UTC] yacherdy: Well, Phil should have changed the formula years ago.
[2017-03-05 06:16:27 UTC] lorienawim: i work as a strategy consultant for 6 years
[2017-03-05 06:16:44 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I hate be that guy most of his viewers was hardcore John Rambo fans
[2017-03-05 06:16:47 UTC] toooldforgaming: Phils PC is far more than powerful enough to do anything he wants
[2017-03-05 06:16:52 UTC] yacherdy: when he started doing direct capture...he should started doing less games, and more edited content. It would have hurt his pride but oh well
[2017-03-05 06:17:05 UTC] toooldforgaming: MY PC is just BARELY a step up from his
[2017-03-05 06:17:09 UTC] toooldforgaming: My main work PC
[2017-03-05 06:17:10 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @yacherdy yea
[2017-03-05 06:17:24 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: having the right hardware isn't always enough if you don't know how to use it optimally
[2017-03-05 06:17:33 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: ^^
[2017-03-05 06:17:36 UTC] yacherdy: I'm a big time John Rambo fan. Think he is funny as fuck.
[2017-03-05 06:17:47 UTC] yacherdy: the Con vlogs were my favorites
[2017-03-05 06:18:04 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I hate when he talks about fps if want good frame rate he needs to learn how use a PC
[2017-03-05 06:18:17 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: it irks me to
[2017-03-05 06:18:33 UTC] yacherdy: It's too bad for all those patreon events for multiplayer PC games were never listed.
[2017-03-05 06:18:40 UTC] yacherdy: I would have played Overwatch with him on PC
[2017-03-05 06:18:40 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: its one of his first points on a lot of the kogaming reviews
[2017-03-05 06:18:55 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Everyone wants to try help him but his a child and lazy wants the easy way
[2017-03-05 06:19:08 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: A true fan needs donate PC lessons to Phil
[2017-03-05 06:19:43 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: You know how Phil talks about views
[2017-03-05 06:20:02 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: He would get more views playing those esports games on twitch like csgo and lol
[2017-03-05 06:20:13 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: and failing
[2017-03-05 06:20:22 UTC] yacherdy: He would get straight raped on CSGO though
[2017-03-05 06:20:30 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: a twitch CSGO audience seeing phil ask how to aim down sights??
[2017-03-05 06:20:40 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: But still tho he bring in the views on e he learns how to play it
[2017-03-05 06:20:47 UTC] yacherdy: and I'm not saying I would do any better
[2017-03-05 06:21:16 UTC] yacherdy: CSGO community is too intimidating for me to jump into
[2017-03-05 06:21:25 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I just play deathmatch
[2017-03-05 06:21:32 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I only play csgo once and it was. On a shorty laptop and I was using a trackpad and I lock their butts lmao XD
[2017-03-05 06:21:42 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I haven't played for over a year. It is not tempting to jump back in to b ehonest
[2017-03-05 06:21:45 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Shitty ..
[2017-03-05 06:21:59 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: ,kick...
[2017-03-05 06:22:14 UTC] yacherdy: overwatch takes skill as well obviously but not as intense as CS community obviously
[2017-03-05 06:22:19 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Sorry guys I'm on my phone and it keeps auto correcting me
[2017-03-05 06:22:22 UTC] yacherdy: too many obviouslys
[2017-03-05 06:22:47 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: CS is pretty easy if you played UT99 against Germans :P
[2017-03-05 06:22:47 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Anything takes skill Phil won't put any time any export game
[2017-03-05 06:22:48 UTC] lorienawim: i guess battle royale type lone wolf games would be more suited for phil
[2017-03-05 06:23:26 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Phil now days he just rush through the game so he can play next one
[2017-03-05 06:23:47 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: careful @kylastoutlaw606
[2017-03-05 06:23:48 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: So he can be the first one to play it
[2017-03-05 06:24:01 UTC] yacherdy: That's why I think he should play less games and try to focus on them more and review them. I think he would enjoy it more.
[2017-03-05 06:24:35 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: He should focus where the money is and it's the esports games story single player games will get boring
[2017-03-05 06:24:46 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: there is more viewers watching an offline stream than there was horizon zero dawn
[2017-03-05 06:24:55 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Unless it's hot title like Zelda
[2017-03-05 06:24:58 UTC] yacherdy: DBstyle
[2017-03-05 06:25:01 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: like pls phil just drop horizon zero dawn
[2017-03-05 06:25:17 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: its shit to stream
[2017-03-05 06:25:21 UTC] yacherdy: I'm personally liking it.
[2017-03-05 06:25:29 UTC] yacherdy: but it's not the most fun to watch
[2017-03-05 06:25:38 UTC] lorienawim: audience for esports games care for skill not personality. i dont think esports is the way forward for a 30+ years old guy
[2017-03-05 06:25:43 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I try watching Phil play horizon and its boring
[2017-03-05 06:25:52 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: the story is great IMO but the open world stuff is just very drawn out
[2017-03-05 06:26:17 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: even if phil was half decent at CS reaction times decrease over age
[2017-03-05 06:26:26 UTC] yacherdy: It's like Yakuza..better to play it yourself.
[2017-03-05 06:26:36 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: can't compete against these 18 year olds fuelled up on their g fuel sponsorship
[2017-03-05 06:26:44 UTC] yacherdy: EleGiggle
[2017-03-05 06:26:47 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @lorienawim then he needs find something else to do cause that's what the kids are into not single player boring long in edited games
[2017-03-05 06:26:55 UTC] lorienawim: he could get into h1z1 or unknownplayers battleground..
[2017-03-05 06:27:08 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: true horizon would be a good contender for a highly edited playthrough
[2017-03-05 06:27:09 UTC] yacherdy: He should just play Buck Bumble on a loop
[2017-03-05 06:27:17 UTC] yacherdy: That's true vidar
[2017-03-05 06:27:22 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Seriously tho guys
[2017-03-05 06:27:47 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I would pay see him drive Winnebago and travel the USA playing Street fighter
[2017-03-05 06:27:56 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: It would be funny
[2017-03-05 06:28:12 UTC] yacherdy: lol he wants nothing to do with FCG though
[2017-03-05 06:28:16 UTC] yacherdy: FGC*
[2017-03-05 06:28:35 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: His gotta do something popular on YouTube cause his left behind
[2017-03-05 06:28:54 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I can start a YouTube channel right now and catch up with Phil
[2017-03-05 06:29:11 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: pfft good luck KyLastOutLaw606
[2017-03-05 06:29:19 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Lol
[2017-03-05 06:29:48 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Kinda talking out my butt but yea if you put time in YouTube you should be able catch up with Phil
[2017-03-05 06:30:02 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah there is too much content to compete with this days In gaming. The days of uploading raw content to youtube Is probably not going to see a renaissance any time soon.
[2017-03-05 06:30:44 UTC] lorienawim: with the new viewer retention KPI, it's impossible for phil to make any revenue with unedited content
[2017-03-05 06:30:44 UTC] yacherdy: Here's the truth: I loved Phil's stuff back in the day when I found him in 2011...I find since he came to Washington he seems to be less interested in games and as a result my interest waned. I miss Phil from 2008-2011
[2017-03-05 06:31:00 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: No one into watching 80 part playthroughs they want something
[2017-03-05 06:31:04 UTC] yacherdy: but I don't live in the past so..
[2017-03-05 06:31:09 UTC] yacherdy: no use really
[2017-03-05 06:31:55 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Same here @yacherdy I started watching Phil cause John Rambo would travel with him video tape him playing street fighter iv
[2017-03-05 06:32:06 UTC] yacherdy: once the whole patreon/youtube streaming thing started unfortunately I kind of tuned out. the rambo things kinda put a fork in it for me. :(
[2017-03-05 06:32:12 UTC] yacherdy: @KyLastOutLaw606 yeah
[2017-03-05 06:32:32 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Phil just need get with times
[2017-03-05 06:32:45 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: No one wants watch playthroughs unless the edit
[2017-03-05 06:32:57 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: or at least understand that different videos are for different demographics.
[2017-03-05 06:33:00 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Or his playing e sports games
[2017-03-05 06:33:22 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I would love see him do a new hobby like Rc or something
[2017-03-05 06:33:25 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: you don't make a thing to fit everyone. But usually something specifically for a certain demographic
[2017-03-05 06:33:39 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Or try bring back cooking with King that was pretty cool
[2017-03-05 06:34:06 UTC] chloeiscool1992: stir the sauce with the king
[2017-03-05 06:34:11 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Lol
[2017-03-05 06:34:15 UTC] yacherdy: All I know is, while I don't enjoy his stuff as much as anymore...I don't hate him nor do I wish anything bad to happen to him. Or anyone. I hope he gets past this major hurdle.
[2017-03-05 06:34:34 UTC] manletbodybuilder: what hurdle
[2017-03-05 06:34:51 UTC] lorienawim: in any case he needs to take action soon. doing the same things and expecting different results wont solve anything..
[2017-03-05 06:34:57 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I use to love Phil and I know how he his but the guy just getting boring , his gotta go back how he was and find something new for YouTube
[2017-03-05 06:35:20 UTC] yacherdy: Well...wrong choice of words. If he cant past this stuff going on, then good for him. I just hope he improves how he does things and himself.
[2017-03-05 06:35:38 UTC] yacherdy: if he can*
[2017-03-05 06:35:42 UTC] yacherdy: Can't type. FML.
[2017-03-05 06:35:43 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Gaming on YouTube is dead if ask me
[2017-03-05 06:35:54 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: You ...
[2017-03-05 06:36:33 UTC] yacherdy: I remember when PeteDorr and HappyConsoleGamer first came on the scene. Can't believe that was almost 10 years ago.
[2017-03-05 06:36:41 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I would rather watch Phil cut the grass then watch him do a boring 80 part playthrough
[2017-03-05 06:36:47 UTC] yacherdy: lol
[2017-03-05 06:36:51 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Ok I am out of here. Be nice to phil guys. HE is after all just a guy that plays vidoegames and wishes to entertain people. ;)
[2017-03-05 06:37:00 UTC] yacherdy: later vidar
[2017-03-05 06:37:05 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Later
[2017-03-05 06:37:11 UTC] lorienawim: see you
[2017-03-05 06:37:25 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: bye yacherdy outlaw and lorenhwim
[2017-03-05 06:38:38 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Problem with Phil is him self , if wants to be a real YouTuber his got stop being lazy and really put in time with YouTube
[2017-03-05 06:39:19 UTC] yacherdy: Well, it's probably too late. Already built up a certain reputation with people.
[2017-03-05 06:39:35 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Yea
[2017-03-05 06:39:49 UTC] yacherdy: Like...people want to see him homeless lol
[2017-03-05 06:40:05 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I can't remember who it was in chat talkin shit about John Rambo lol
[2017-03-05 06:40:25 UTC] yacherdy: BusinessGuy?
[2017-03-05 06:40:35 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Yea that was him lol
[2017-03-05 06:40:52 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: If you ask me Phil used John Rambo like a dog
[2017-03-05 06:41:20 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: John Rambo was popular on his YouTube channel by helping him do co op and they was the best videos by far
[2017-03-05 06:41:29 UTC] lorienawim: phil reminds me the case of yahoo. thats why i am interested how his case turns out
[2017-03-05 06:41:36 UTC] yacherdy: Well, I'm not gonna say for sure. All we have is Phil and John's word of what happened.
[2017-03-05 06:42:17 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I know is John Rambo drove all the way from NY and pretty much help Phil for free
[2017-03-05 06:42:17 UTC] lorienawim: riding the wave for too long without anticipating and reacting to the change around you...
[2017-03-05 06:42:28 UTC] yacherdy: tbh, the two should just bury the hatchet. It'll be hard....grudges are hard to get rid of. Hell, I have trouble with them.
[2017-03-05 06:42:46 UTC] yacherdy: I'm too stubborn
[2017-03-05 06:43:04 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I mean it seem like John put time with Phil
[2017-03-05 06:43:15 UTC] yacherdy: but sometimes, for sake of mental and emotional state...it might be the best for me to do...same goes with Phil
[2017-03-05 06:43:30 UTC] yacherdy: well yeah John used to drive an hour a half or whatever to Phil's place
[2017-03-05 06:43:51 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Phil never ask how John was or wanna meet his parents
[2017-03-05 06:43:52 UTC] yacherdy: Jesus I can't type tonight. NotLikeThis
[2017-03-05 06:44:01 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Or wanna go see John
[2017-03-05 06:44:41 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Everyone uses that Phil has a bad back that's bunch of bull shit
[2017-03-05 06:45:06 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah i guess we'll never know the full details
[2017-03-05 06:45:08 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: He really had bad back he wouldn't be driving locally
[2017-03-05 06:45:40 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Ik is Phil got lucky with YouTube and let go down hill
[2017-03-05 06:45:50 UTC] lorienawim: if someone is investing his time for you, you either pay him for his trouble or appreciate his efforts
[2017-03-05 06:46:02 UTC] lorienawim: that was the main problem i guess
[2017-03-05 06:46:04 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: If you ever had that chance like Phil had you would never let it split away
[2017-03-05 06:46:23 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah true
[2017-03-05 06:46:47 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @lorienawim all I'm saying is Phil could had come once awhile to my film at johns place to do co op
[2017-03-05 06:47:34 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @lorienawim how would u feel not making anything wasting gas and putting miles on your car when it's your not your channel ? And his getting payed 5000 a month?
[2017-03-05 06:47:40 UTC] lorienawim: i agree. if he can't, he could talk openly about johns commitment and how much it means for him
[2017-03-05 06:48:09 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I don't care about the money
[2017-03-05 06:48:19 UTC] rnrs: I have a question
[2017-03-05 06:48:34 UTC] marcusdoesgaming: fuck i missed it again
[2017-03-05 06:48:45 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: But Phil could had put time in his friendship with John at least going to ny visiting him and seeing his family
[2017-03-05 06:48:51 UTC] rnrs: does us waiting around to see the end of DSP make us the type of people that just want to watch the world burn?
[2017-03-05 06:49:07 UTC] rnrs: because part of me is like why watch a man suffer
[2017-03-05 06:49:22 UTC] rnrs: and part of me knows this is all over due karma
[2017-03-05 06:49:29 UTC] lorienawim: @RnRs : you gain valuable life experience by observing without experiencing it..
[2017-03-05 06:49:30 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I don't wanna see him suffer but he put him self there
[2017-03-05 06:49:54 UTC] rnrs: oh I've hit rock bottom befor
[2017-03-05 06:49:57 UTC] yacherdy: Well I'm not a Phil supporter anymore but me personally I don't like watching people crash and burn
[2017-03-05 06:50:01 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: We all know Phil is a piece of shit and its honest truth
[2017-03-05 06:50:13 UTC] yacherdy: Even if they've done some stupid shit and may deserve it
[2017-03-05 06:50:18 UTC] rnrs: I've got as low as not having rent money or even knowing where my next meal was coming from
[2017-03-05 06:50:27 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: We all know he doesn't even care about his gf and that's honest truth too
[2017-03-05 06:50:31 UTC] rnrs: I had the opportunity to go back home and live with my mom
[2017-03-05 06:50:33 UTC] rnrs: and got a job
[2017-03-05 06:50:37 UTC] rnrs: turned life around
[2017-03-05 06:50:43 UTC] rnrs: thats why this is intriguing
[2017-03-05 06:51:04 UTC] rnrs: right now Phil is the version of me that didn't go home and get a job and get life back together
[2017-03-05 06:51:08 UTC] yacherdy: I think without YouTube, Phil will have a much better life. Less stress involved
[2017-03-05 06:51:11 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I know is if you had the chance like Phil had its like winning the lottery and he let slip away
[2017-03-05 06:51:34 UTC] yacherdy: He could actually enjoy games again
[2017-03-05 06:51:37 UTC] lorienawim: phil set his standarts too high without building a proper foundations. it wont be easy to downscale his life style living with another person
[2017-03-05 06:51:53 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I come out and ask everyone here ?
[2017-03-05 06:52:12 UTC] rnrs: if I had a chance I'm taking it to the top
[2017-03-05 06:52:30 UTC] rnrs: I'd kill for a chance like this
[2017-03-05 06:52:39 UTC] rnrs: im not someone thats some 8 year dsp fan
[2017-03-05 06:52:40 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Did anyone believed him getting fired from his office job long time ago ? And putting in full time in YouTube ? Cause I never believe it I think he had enough followers one day and said fuck it
[2017-03-05 06:52:44 UTC] yacherdy: That's the problem. A lot of us live beyond our means when we don't need to
[2017-03-05 06:52:59 UTC] yacherdy: Like why a big house? Why a BMW?
[2017-03-05 06:52:59 UTC] rnrs: but I remember him back in the day and his assetion and I'm like cool good for this guy
[2017-03-05 06:53:06 UTC] rnrs: but his done literally nothing since
[2017-03-05 06:53:26 UTC] rnrs: I feel like Phil is the kid in school that never once had a good ass kicking
[2017-03-05 06:53:27 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Phil wants the famous life style
[2017-03-05 06:53:36 UTC] rnrs: thats where I think he's the way he is
[2017-03-05 06:53:46 UTC] rnrs: his parents never beat him and he never got bullied by anyone
[2017-03-05 06:53:51 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: And why go for a sports car when he could got nice usv for his back
[2017-03-05 06:54:19 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I know is I would killed for the chance his gotten
[2017-03-05 06:54:22 UTC] lorienawim: structuring in organisations happen every time. his decision was to jump on the internet bubble but failed to adapt to the changes around him
[2017-03-05 06:54:25 UTC] yacherdy: Well you don't need to beat on as a child to be humble
[2017-03-05 06:54:33 UTC] lorienawim: just like nokia or yahoo..
[2017-03-05 06:54:36 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: And he wants he can still tears it around
[2017-03-05 06:54:42 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Turn...
[2017-03-05 06:55:06 UTC] rnrs: I feel like my mom beat me just enough as a kid
[2017-03-05 06:55:12 UTC] rnrs: to the point I'm a stable human being
[2017-03-05 06:55:17 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: The Phil was raised money grown on trees
[2017-03-05 06:55:23 UTC] rnrs: hell I probably could have used a couple more beatings
[2017-03-05 06:55:52 UTC] yacherdy: Well whatever you're situation was it worked for you, so that's good...but I don't think it's universal
[2017-03-05 06:55:58 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: My mom went got thorn bush stick whoop me and my twin butt if we did something wrong and we learn family lessons
[2017-03-05 06:55:59 UTC] yacherdy: Every person is diffrrent
[2017-03-05 06:56:07 UTC] rnrs: black family single mom not great neighborhood
[2017-03-05 06:56:12 UTC] rnrs: she did what she had to do
[2017-03-05 06:56:45 UTC] rnrs: not dead or in jail so I applaud her
[2017-03-05 06:56:47 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I hate how he talks about his dad and mom do any of ya'll remember that
[2017-03-05 06:57:02 UTC] rnrs: thats why I brought up the beating thing
[2017-03-05 06:57:12 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah that's tough @RnRs
[2017-03-05 06:57:15 UTC] rnrs: if that was me I wouldn't have been able to sit down for 3 d ays
[2017-03-05 06:57:18 UTC] yacherdy: I can't imagine.
[2017-03-05 06:57:30 UTC] rnrs: I could never talk to my mom like that ever
[2017-03-05 06:57:40 UTC] yacherdy: Yes KY
[2017-03-05 06:57:44 UTC] rnrs: shit im 27 years old and I just started swearing in front of her year or so ago
[2017-03-05 06:57:46 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I wish I known his parents to show them the videos where he talks to his parents like dogs
[2017-03-05 06:57:53 UTC] yacherdy: Whoop I meant Ky not KY lol
[2017-03-05 06:58:02 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I'm turning 27 this 9th
[2017-03-05 06:58:34 UTC] yacherdy: Just turned 25 here

[2017-03-05 07:00:39 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I wish they make the new Zelda realistic but it's whatever
[2017-03-05 07:00:48 UTC] lorienawim: he wont be playing zelda. he cant upload nintendo videos on youtube without a partner
[2017-03-05 07:00:52 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: It looks good
[2017-03-05 07:01:04 UTC] lorienawim: his switch will stay "bricked" until he finds a partner
[2017-03-05 07:01:05 UTC] rnrs: he's still gonna upload anyway
[2017-03-05 07:01:08 UTC] rnrs: because he's Phil
[2017-03-05 07:01:13 UTC] rnrs: bet you $5
[2017-03-05 07:01:40 UTC] rnrs: I really do believe he was stupid enough to fuck it up
[2017-03-05 07:01:43 UTC] lorienawim: he is too riskaverse for that i think
[2017-03-05 07:01:45 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @lorienawim I said the same thing his switch is not broken it's cause his scared Of not having partner
[2017-03-05 07:01:54 UTC] rnrs: some other youtue person had the same problem I forget his name
[2017-03-05 07:02:11 UTC] yacherdy: Maxamillion?
[2017-03-05 07:02:12 UTC] lorienawim: i agree Ky
[2017-03-05 07:02:13 UTC] rnrs: where they charged it all night and didn't work the next morning
[2017-03-05 07:02:27 UTC] rnrs: I think so
[2017-03-05 07:02:31 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @lorienawim I say he let the battery die last night make sure he unplug it from the wall so it wouldn't get power
[2017-03-05 07:02:45 UTC] yacherdy: I don't watch him but I heard about it
[2017-03-05 07:02:59 UTC] lorienawim: in any case, as we have seen today youtube is more important for him
[2017-03-05 07:03:02 UTC] rnrs: if I was Phil
[2017-03-05 07:03:14 UTC] rnrs: I'd just drive right up to nintendo headquarters
[2017-03-05 07:03:17 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: So he make everyone think he got a bad switch but really came down cause he doesn't have partner to upload Nintendo games
[2017-03-05 07:03:19 UTC] rnrs: and be like fuck it give me a new one
[2017-03-05 07:03:22 UTC] lorienawim: without partner support, there is no way he will play zelda just for twitch
[2017-03-05 07:03:59 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @lorienawim he needs partner make money on Nintendo games that's what came down today everyone with a brain known it
[2017-03-05 07:04:09 UTC] yacherdy: "If I don't get answers, I will pound the FUCK outta them" TriHard
[2017-03-05 07:04:24 UTC] lorienawim: i agree Ky
[2017-03-05 07:04:42 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: There was nothing wrong with that switch he let the battery died and had it unplug from the wall so it wouldn't charge on stream
[2017-03-05 07:05:02 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: We all know how Phil is he won't upload game unless he can make money on it
[2017-03-05 07:05:28 UTC] rnrs: I cant wait to see what he says about Best Buy tomorrow
[2017-03-05 07:05:34 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Lol

[2017-03-05 07:06:09 UTC] yacherdy: like he said he was gonna do with YouTube
[2017-03-05 07:06:35 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: If his switch really broke and cared for his fans he would stream Zelda wii u for his fans
[2017-03-05 07:07:13 UTC] yacherdy: well he said he'd only play it if a fan donated 60 dollars to him or whatever
[2017-03-05 07:07:19 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: That man would never play Zelda until his partner with someone so he can make money
[2017-03-05 07:07:36 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @yacherdy yea lmao
[2017-03-05 07:08:14 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: If that was me I would had went gotten a wii u copy make my fans happy even tho I wouldn't make any money
[2017-03-05 07:08:33 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: It's not like his wasting time putting them on YouTube cause he doesn't edit his videos
[2017-03-05 07:09:20 UTC] yacherdy: I don't know, it's just a big mess FailFish
[2017-03-05 07:09:27 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: But we all know tho that switch is not broken lmao it's uncharged from last night & the dock in hook from the wall
[2017-03-05 07:10:06 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I wish someone was in the chat ask him go to wall see the cords

[2017-03-05 07:11:17 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: We all know his not going play nitnedo game until his partner
[2017-03-05 07:11:33 UTC] yacherdy: I don't think anyone I watch is doing a playthrough
[2017-03-05 07:13:23 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: That switch will stay brick until he finds a partner
[2017-03-05 07:13:47 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Cause we know he won't upload it or stream it for his fans for free
[2017-03-05 07:14:20 UTC] yacherdy: EleGiggle
[2017-03-05 07:14:27 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Someone ask put on the Pateron goals cause then he would say I finally figure it out

[2017-03-05 07:15:25 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: If that switch was really broken he would had ran out to best buy get a copy for the wii u and love stream it
[2017-03-05 07:16:02 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Cause we all know Zelda new hot title and he would bring in the views . But he can't do that cause he doesn't have a partner
[2017-03-05 07:16:44 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: And his fans would donate 1200 once he gets the money he play the first dungeon and quit
[2017-03-05 07:17:11 UTC] yacherdy: lol first dungeon and quit

[2017-03-05 07:18:27 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: It would be nice if he would tell the truth but we know he wouldn't tell cause he doesn't want the people know his about the money
[2017-03-05 07:18:58 UTC] yacherdy: well I think we already found out it's usually about money lol
[2017-03-05 07:19:09 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: @yacherdy if your in his chat tomorrow ask him to put in the goal watch him
[2017-03-05 07:19:44 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: I just don't know why his child fans wanna donate their lunch money for him
[2017-03-05 07:19:53 UTC] yacherdy: He has a day off tomorrow but if I did I'd probably get banned again and called a retard
[2017-03-05 07:20:08 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Lmao yep that's true
[2017-03-05 07:20:18 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Anyone else in this chat?

[2017-03-05 07:24:54 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: He doesn't know if u talk to same people ever day in his chat you going start talking about other things
[2017-03-05 07:25:58 UTC] kylastoutlaw606: Watch a boring person for hour u going start about other things in the chat
[2017-03-05 07:26:07 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah...he claimed we were talking about weird disgusting shit, when all we were talking about was someone's wifes morning sickness, because she's pregnant. He said to stop talking about disgusting shit and talk about the game or get out. I'm like...you make dick jokes 24/7. It was during the Nioh playthrough, his meltdown is on youtube
