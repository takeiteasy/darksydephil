[2017-03-24 20:21:22 UTC] fartsydephil: What? I thought he got fired
[2017-03-24 20:21:33 UTC] kushiyakitori: @Jameskenn70, I think like 50-60 at this point
[2017-03-24 20:21:34 UTC] sanguinenite: Go Trump!

[2017-03-24 20:22:10 UTC] fartsydephil: Why did they split up then?
[2017-03-24 20:22:11 UTC] betheboom: phil didnt quit machinima nor did he get fired, they negotiated for him to find a new partner once his contract runs out
[2017-03-24 20:22:12 UTC] kinggoken: Donald Trump...lol
[2017-03-24 20:22:17 UTC] kinggoken: still shocked he is the President

[2017-03-24 20:27:24 UTC] betheboom: if phil wanted him gone he would get rid of him calm down :D
[2017-03-24 20:27:24 UTC] fartsydephil: how many hours doe he stream now

[2017-03-24 20:27:48 UTC] betheboom: fsp 4 hours a day or 6 if double stream
[2017-03-24 20:28:13 UTC] stuart360: Watching Phil since 2010 means nothing, all the trolls do the same as they are that obsessed with him
[2017-03-24 20:28:19 UTC] crazed_connovore: Mr. Owl how many livks does it take to get to the tootsie roll center of a tootsie pop?

[2017-03-24 20:28:22 UTC] dragonjarvis: I remember the day where phil farted on stream actually
[2017-03-24 20:28:26 UTC] betheboom: kinggoken people dont really come for zelda which is unfortunate
[2017-03-24 20:28:43 UTC] kinggoken: yeah that is unfortunate. Zelda is awesome.
[2017-03-24 20:28:52 UTC] betheboom: phil would admit if he farted to be honest
[2017-03-24 20:29:05 UTC] betheboom: if he can admit to fapping farting is nothing
[2017-03-24 20:29:18 UTC] sanguinenite: lol

[2017-03-24 20:29:53 UTC] capstonegaming: yeah so repubs couldnt pass the bill because all theyve basically been doing is complaining because ppl have ideas that they never thought about and this bill proves theyve thought nothing about healthcare and more a bout complaining
[2017-03-24 20:30:07 UTC] tmoney508: jsut play the game and dont talk about money

[2017-03-24 20:30:49 UTC] capstonegaming: no its true
[2017-03-24 20:30:49 UTC] nolbert87: 007 it didn't go through
[2017-03-24 20:30:50 UTC] sanguinenite: I need to see the video when Phil farted
[2017-03-24 20:30:52 UTC] capstonegaming: they dont have a healthcare bill
[2017-03-24 20:31:15 UTC] capstonegaming: in their own words "going from an opisitional party to the governing party will take some time"
[2017-03-24 20:31:28 UTC] crazed_connovore: @sanguinenite that is in a video?
[2017-03-24 20:31:36 UTC] fartsydephil: I know they don't, they've been trying to repeal the ACA for 5 years with 60+ attempts, they would have a plan by now. Your "complaining" analysis was what was simplistic and odd
[2017-03-24 20:31:42 UTC] capstonegaming: they never thought theyd get this far let alone having good plans theyve worked out
[2017-03-24 20:32:10 UTC] capstonegaming: well when you say something sucks but dont have the proper replacement READY in the wings to replace it...then what are you doing?
[2017-03-24 20:32:21 UTC] capstonegaming: we elect you okay wheres ur promise?
[2017-03-24 20:32:23 UTC] sanguinenite: which one? You dont expect me to see all 40000 videos to know which video it happened? lol

[2017-03-24 20:32:33 UTC] kinggoken: I quit porn
[2017-03-24 20:32:39 UTC] capstonegaming: replace it or its just another broken promise

[2017-03-24 21:19:21 UTC] megamannt125: Seems like they should've replaced the dead champions as the beast pilots, seems like that's what their storylines are leading up to and then they just stop being relevant

[2017-03-24 23:27:27 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: @fartsydephil defended Phil when ppl were decrying about Panda Lees boob size
[2017-03-24 23:27:41 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: phil will fail if he doesnt respect his fans and lashes out on them
[2017-03-24 23:27:49 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: especially those who defend him like fsp
[2017-03-24 23:28:23 UTC] ratchefan12: i'll let him know when i can
[2017-03-24 23:29:36 UTC] ratchefan12: he thought fsp was dissing panda
[2017-03-24 23:29:48 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: thats his problem man
[2017-03-24 23:29:51 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: hes too reactionary
[2017-03-24 23:30:02 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: lashes out immediately out of insecurity
[2017-03-24 23:30:23 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: Probably wondering if Pandas breasts truly are inadequate or not
[2017-03-24 23:30:26 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: wild guy man
[2017-03-24 23:31:09 UTC] ratchefan12: even given that his streams are bringing him sucess
[2017-03-24 23:31:31 UTC] ratchefan12: im happy for him
[2017-03-24 23:31:57 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: I hope so. He needs to watch his mouth tho
[2017-03-24 23:32:26 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: there could be a machinima exec watching and he cud lash out on them not knowing that and lose a big opportunity
[2017-03-24 23:32:44 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: that idiot
[2017-03-24 23:33:13 UTC] ratchefan12: well given evrything e has been through i dont blame him he got swatted for gods sake
[2017-03-24 23:33:20 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: the president of Gamestop could be watching
[2017-03-24 23:33:39 UTC] ratchefan12: thats true you never know who's watching
[2017-03-24 23:33:58 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: and comment on how he thinks he should be more interactive, which phil made an ENTIRE stream discussing with his fans
[2017-03-24 23:34:18 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: so its not like thats out of nowhere, or rude to talk about
[2017-03-24 23:34:48 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: and he could get take it personally, get offended, and ruin a chance to be sponsored by the president of America
[2017-03-24 23:34:49 UTC] ratchefan12: to be fair i was away from the stream when fsp got kicked
[2017-03-24 23:35:04 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: Phil was out of line man
[2017-03-24 23:35:20 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: Do u think FSP shud have been banned?
[2017-03-24 23:35:51 UTC] ratchefan12: well no i dont i would have mentioned to phil that fsp was defending him if i had been there
[2017-03-24 23:36:10 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: Did u see what ppl were saying about Leanna?
[2017-03-24 23:36:27 UTC] ratchefan12: no i didnt
[2017-03-24 23:36:32 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: they were sayin shit like "her tits are pretty nice. LTGs gf is hotter, but Id take a tit job from Leanna"
[2017-03-24 23:36:45 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: "Thats what biches r for, am I right?"
[2017-03-24 23:36:49 UTC] ratchefan12: holy shit
[2017-03-24 23:36:55 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: Thats what I remember at least
[2017-03-24 23:37:34 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: FSP was yelling at them cuz they were talkin shit while Phil was on break
[2017-03-24 23:38:05 UTC] ratchefan12: and unfornately phil came back saw what was going on and assumed
[2017-03-24 23:38:06 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: guess he thought he was the one talking shit cuz he wudnt let it go
[2017-03-24 23:38:10 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: was the last one talking about it
[2017-03-24 23:38:17 UTC] ratchefan12: exactly
[2017-03-24 23:38:24 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: I guess. Hopefully no detractor vid is made over this
[2017-03-24 23:38:54 UTC] ratchefan12: i hope not either
[2017-03-24 23:39:03 UTC] ratchefan12: Evilaj is a dumb ass
[2017-03-24 23:39:16 UTC] ratchefan12: he spends so much time hateing phil

[2017-03-24 23:41:06 UTC] ratchefan12: so the anger is gonna come if he feels it needs to he cares about panda
[2017-03-24 23:41:11 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: Phil is just gonna ban people wrongfully sometimes, or call ppl names when he shudnt,, or make fun of Asians every game he plays. Ya cant stop the man.
[2017-03-24 23:41:28 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: Mans gotta do what a mans gotta do
[2017-03-24 23:41:55 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: those pussies wudnt last a day in Connecticut man
[2017-03-24 23:42:18 UTC] ratchefan12: oh yeah fred fuches had a video of the swatting incident and it was extended supposedly
[2017-03-24 23:42:19 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: what happened?
[2017-03-24 23:42:45 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: we were talking about how phil banned FSP for defending leanna, and then phil banned him
[2017-03-24 23:43:03 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: even though it was everyone else talkin about leannas tits and what have you during the break
[2017-03-24 23:43:16 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: the man doesnt think before shooting man
[2017-03-24 23:43:35 UTC] thekingofcrybabyshd: FSP?
[2017-03-24 23:43:36 UTC] ratchefan12: fsp should have dropped it though and not risk it
[2017-03-24 23:43:45 UTC] pizzaboyphillip: another detractor video in the barrel I guess
