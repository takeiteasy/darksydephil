[2017-03-30 21:19:23 UTC] codenameone: @encelor So let me guess; they lorded over the "lesser" species, like humanity, and man said "fuck you"?
[2017-03-30 21:19:23 UTC] encelor: @CodenameOne then the first flame appeard and giant took it and went war with dragons wich i dunno what reason
[2017-03-30 21:19:29 UTC] miss_kelcher: @ratchefan12 well, it's 11 pm for me, so I'm getting kinda tired :P
[2017-03-30 21:19:30 UTC] xgameofpwns: Phil had trouble with ludwig because there are no shields in BB and the arena didn't have any cheese spots
[2017-03-30 21:19:35 UTC] popsicolo: Prodigious size alone does not dissuade the sharpened blade!
[2017-03-30 21:19:36 UTC] darksydewolflink: Try to grab the tail, Phil. Weak resistance stats.
[2017-03-30 21:19:36 UTC] royal_phalanx91: why did seath the scaleless betray the dragons?
[2017-03-30 21:19:40 UTC] alexharveyconrad: Gael is my personal favourite. There is style and charm to his fighting skills.

[2017-03-30 21:23:13 UTC] ihrie: i think its a trade off actually. BB bosses are more brutal, but there is no blocking mechanic, only dodge. that simplifies things a little
[2017-03-30 21:23:17 UTC] silenus841: Phil should go back to the Old Hunters DLC for BB
