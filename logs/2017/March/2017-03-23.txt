[2017-03-23 19:14:39 UTC] o0kingsix0o: @HowlintheDeep, Ahh...just don't really see why that's so important, I guess. It's just video games.
[2017-03-23 19:14:47 UTC] lunaequalsluna: i haven't watched that playthru
[2017-03-23 19:15:00 UTC] betheboom: jimbob people telling him what to do and the halberd was the BULLSHIT part
[2017-03-23 19:15:06 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Memories are a key part of the story, still do them
[2017-03-23 19:15:09 UTC] serenexe: whats wrong with hand holding or getting help in a game
[2017-03-23 19:15:10 UTC] howlinthedeep: oh i don't really care about it o0kingsix0o just that people think it was more than what it was
[2017-03-23 19:15:17 UTC] royal_phalanx91: to be fair halberd was a random drop
[2017-03-23 19:15:18 UTC] sardarkh: Still not enough triggers. Phil Ryder can't achieve triggered status yet
[2017-03-23 19:15:27 UTC] tommywiseauhere: amazing quests ResidentSleeper
[2017-03-23 19:15:27 UTC] stuart360: memory triggers unlock back story and some familiar faces come to light
[2017-03-23 19:15:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the halberd was a random drop betheboom iirc
[2017-03-23 19:15:36 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: back
[2017-03-23 19:15:40 UTC] podusmonens: bethe you tell him what to do all the time
[2017-03-23 19:15:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: wb delta
[2017-03-23 19:15:42 UTC] betheboom: still BULLSHIT
[2017-03-23 19:15:49 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: bullshit?
[2017-03-23 19:15:59 UTC] betheboom: dragin yeah but not when it was the redemption run
[2017-03-23 19:16:00 UTC] howlinthedeep: Also him making exuses then saying they weren't excuses just saying what was happening is bs too
[2017-03-23 19:16:05 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: Derichloveslemur literally word for word was copying from an online guide what phil had to do on BoTW, shit was hilarious.
[2017-03-23 19:16:15 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey yacherdy o/
[2017-03-23 19:16:18 UTC] betheboom: hello cherdy

[2017-03-23 19:16:46 UTC] encelor: what up yacherdy
[2017-03-23 19:17:05 UTC] howlinthedeep: to be fair though he did a lot more by himself in the redemption
[2017-03-23 19:17:05 UTC] royal_phalanx91: bonne idee Phil
[2017-03-23 19:17:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it depends on the person HowlintheDeep the definition of an excuse. I think you're blurring the line between genuine observation and excuse though
[2017-03-23 19:17:15 UTC] yacherdy: Not too bad delta, yourself?
[2017-03-23 19:17:26 UTC] yacherdy: what up @encelor @superbatcat
[2017-03-23 19:17:27 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: good too
[2017-03-23 19:17:28 UTC] stuart360: Speaking of Dark Souls, i hope Phil does a DS2 no dicklightning, no summons, redemption run. He could do a 60fps run on PS4
[2017-03-23 19:17:35 UTC] yacherdy: @darthvidarviking HeyGuys
[2017-03-23 19:17:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: that would be awesome stuart360

[2017-03-23 19:18:17 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I needed summons for ruin sentinels xD
[2017-03-23 19:18:22 UTC] howlinthedeep: Did he not justify himself jimbob?
[2017-03-23 19:18:35 UTC] yacherdy: Is there already chat tension?
[2017-03-23 19:18:42 UTC] howlinthedeep: or do you want to make your own dictionary jimbob?

[2017-03-23 19:19:29 UTC] shekelbergosteinwitz: Phil is having FUN!!
[2017-03-23 19:19:31 UTC] yacherdy: I'm staying out of this.
[2017-03-23 19:19:33 UTC] bbt_2017: Phil should replay Kingdom Hearts 1&2 since they re-release at 60fps soon. FFXV Episode Gladiolus too!
[2017-03-23 19:19:34 UTC] pelicanpencil: he only partly redeemed himself..
[2017-03-23 19:19:42 UTC] shekelbergosteinwitz: ResidentSleeper
[2017-03-23 19:19:48 UTC] errnoent: I think Phil redeemed himself but he did run through the game in full havel's so idk..
[2017-03-23 19:20:00 UTC] encelor: @YaCherdy you played me mp yet?
[2017-03-23 19:20:03 UTC] superbatcat: Hey lvlpower whats up
[2017-03-23 19:20:04 UTC] sardarkh: Man, that ryder faces really seems a bearded toddler to me
[2017-03-23 19:20:05 UTC] stuart360: To be fair to Phil, the Halbred was an item drop. The same happened to me but i got the sword.
[2017-03-23 19:20:05 UTC] wolfofthedawn: when's the scarface redemption run Kappa
[2017-03-23 19:20:08 UTC] errnoent: Honestly I could never get havel's to work. You still take damage and you're too slow to dodge so for me it sucks ass
[2017-03-23 19:20:10 UTC] bakedessert: I expected him to struggle tbh
[2017-03-23 19:20:13 UTC] mfd4419: The best players at on point ues summons facts
[2017-03-23 19:20:15 UTC] yacherdy: @encelor Nah I want to get farther in the game before I do :p
[2017-03-23 19:20:18 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: the real redemption run will happen when he will replay Nier or Nioh
[2017-03-23 19:20:20 UTC] pelicanpencil: i got the halberd on my recent run
[2017-03-23 19:20:32 UTC] encelor: @YaCherdy i only played mp xD

[2017-03-23 19:20:34 UTC] howlinthedeep: he has to finish that first wolfofthedawn
[2017-03-23 19:20:39 UTC] yacherdy: @encelor lol
[2017-03-23 19:20:39 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @stuart360, It's silly to get mad at someone like Phil using a weapon that he got randomly....you're basically telling him to purposefully handicap himself..
[2017-03-23 19:21:04 UTC] yacherdy: There's some stomach flu going around...I hope to FUCK I don't get it.
[2017-03-23 19:21:09 UTC] betheboom: no delta NotLikeThis
[2017-03-23 19:21:09 UTC] wolfofthedawn: true but that ain't happening lol @HowlintheDeep
[2017-03-23 19:21:13 UTC] pelicanpencil: I can't wait till he does a bloodborne dlc redemption run ;) well, that'll never happen
[2017-03-23 19:21:20 UTC] lvlpower: Phil going to play side content
[2017-03-23 19:21:20 UTC] superbatcat: I got the halberd on third go through

[2017-03-23 19:21:47 UTC] yacherdy: I can take colds/fever...but when bodily fluids come into play, I'm out.
[2017-03-23 19:21:51 UTC] pelicanpencil: it doesn't matter, he wouldn't do it even if the save still existed
[2017-03-23 19:21:58 UTC] wolfofthedawn: so let's just make a list of redemption runs we want that'll never happen and send it to phil Kappa
[2017-03-23 19:22:00 UTC] errnoent: walk and discuss what's wrong with games these days

[2017-03-23 19:22:20 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @iconicmaster1, Naruto ended over two years ago now, lol. Anime has been doing filler and light novel adaptations for a while.
[2017-03-23 19:22:24 UTC] yacherdy: Uhhhh
[2017-03-23 19:22:28 UTC] betheboom: :D

[2017-03-23 19:24:25 UTC] howlinthedeep: yeah jimbob he delayed the event until december...it was planned to be in november of that year
[2017-03-23 19:24:28 UTC] yacherdy: While playing ME:A I'm also replaying Alan Wake. Great game. SeemsGood
[2017-03-23 19:25:13 UTC] pelicanpencil: pistol
[2017-03-23 19:25:20 UTC] pelicanpencil: upgrade the pistol whip
[2017-03-23 19:25:30 UTC] howlinthedeep: His alan wake playthrough was legendary
[2017-03-23 19:25:52 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah deep that was the same month he did RDR too
[2017-03-23 19:26:07 UTC] pelicanpencil: So, is the story up to snuff so far?
[2017-03-23 19:26:10 UTC] superbatcat: Alan Wake awesome game
[2017-03-23 19:26:20 UTC] stuart360: His Alan Wake playthrouygh wasn't that good to be honest. Phil liked the game until John Rambo came around and then they were both hating on the game lol
[2017-03-23 19:26:20 UTC] sire1986: chat...
[2017-03-23 19:26:25 UTC] yacherdy: Alan Wake looks pretty good on PC.
[2017-03-23 19:26:25 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @Howlinthedeep Your mom is legendary... CoolStoryBob oh my bad RitzMitz
[2017-03-23 19:26:26 UTC] pelicanpencil: or too generic?
[2017-03-23 19:26:33 UTC] sire1986: Tell him to do the scientist mission
[2017-03-23 19:26:35 UTC] sire1986: its awesome
[2017-03-23 19:26:43 UTC] sire1986: one of the better missions
[2017-03-23 19:27:00 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Widow rifle is the best sniper
[2017-03-23 19:27:04 UTC] howlinthedeep: hey there spartan
[2017-03-23 19:27:04 UTC] hapticbabyman: Good to see some 4X elements still exist in the game at least
[2017-03-23 19:27:13 UTC] yacherdy: @stuart360 Actually I agree that end of the playthrough was kind of ruined. It was good until both John and DSP were there. This coming from a John Rambo fan.
[2017-03-23 19:27:18 UTC] bakedessert: @Pelicanpencil It is quite interesting to watch
[2017-03-23 19:27:29 UTC] howlinthedeep: Don't you talk crap about my mom
[2017-03-23 19:27:36 UTC] yacherdy: Uh oh.
[2017-03-23 19:27:45 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @howlinthedeep it was a compliment RitzMitz
[2017-03-23 19:27:46 UTC] sire1986: @DarksydePhil dont leave without doing the scientist mission
[2017-03-23 19:27:50 UTC] stuart360: yeah i agree Yacherdy
[2017-03-23 19:27:56 UTC] pelicanpencil: seems like this game has some good things.. like the combat/upgrade system

[2017-03-23 19:28:47 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: k
[2017-03-23 19:28:48 UTC] stuart360: Yeah this game isn't perfect, and it has bugs, but its still a good game overall. It was just a bit too ambitious for the dev team
[2017-03-23 19:28:53 UTC] mfd4419: I new it
[2017-03-23 19:29:16 UTC] betheboom: delta i used to but not anymore
[2017-03-23 19:29:20 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: how did that happened again, deep?
[2017-03-23 19:29:25 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @stuart360, It's personally a 6/10 for me. Slightly above average.
[2017-03-23 19:29:26 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: i forgot

[2017-03-23 19:29:37 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Not as good as 1 or 2.
[2017-03-23 19:29:39 UTC] theycallmejimbob: delta oh boy :D
[2017-03-23 19:29:44 UTC] pelicanpencil: perhaps i'll just wait a while to play it when the price is down
[2017-03-23 19:29:47 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Especially 2, 2 was the best.
[2017-03-23 19:30:06 UTC] stuart360: It would be a 7.5/10 for me so far, 10 hours in
[2017-03-23 19:30:08 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I like my Widow and Black Widow Sniper Rifles
[2017-03-23 19:30:10 UTC] howlinthedeep: damn that was a long time ago delta...rambo and howard made a vlog hating on Phil out of nowhere. Never told Phil that there was any problem
[2017-03-23 19:30:32 UTC] thenewfaceofcreation: so they hated him out of nowhere
[2017-03-23 19:30:33 UTC] yacherdy: same stuary

[2017-03-23 19:31:13 UTC] yacherdy: sides*
[2017-03-23 19:31:16 UTC] neobornbloodmoonspartan9: @howlinthedeep I never watched any of those videos. I hate drama and so I skipped on that and all the hater vids.
[2017-03-23 19:31:34 UTC] pelicanpencil: probably better to skip the drama tbh
[2017-03-23 19:31:38 UTC] betheboom: drop it dspHmm sounds like ichigo
[2017-03-23 19:31:38 UTC] mfd4419: Phill is like why is chat talking about Rambo lol

[2017-03-23 21:43:53 UTC] howlinthedeep: buttttt
[2017-03-23 21:43:55 UTC] pcgamehunter: Based on how Phil rates games that i'd give a 7 max it's gonna be a 8.25
[2017-03-23 21:44:02 UTC] codenameone: Inb4 he gives it a 9.

[2017-03-23 21:51:14 UTC] codenameone: @Tactical_Twitch I would be OK with Obsidian making another Fallout game with FO4's improved engine. They gotta get better programmers, though. As nearly perfect NV is it's fucking *horribly* unstable.
