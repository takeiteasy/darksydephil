[2017-01-18 00:05:13 UTC] retrocerberus: it took my like over 30 times to kill em
[2017-01-18 00:05:14 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yes steam ends, starts to morrow sam time
[2017-01-18 00:05:38 UTC] gaylordbutthump: yeah, artorias is tough if you're not facetanking him with a greatshield and heavy armor
[2017-01-18 00:06:06 UTC] tulliuscicero25: i fought priscilla first time today. how do you cut her tail when you cant see her?
[2017-01-18 00:06:08 UTC] popstradamus: Like Artorias' running stab should do sooo much more dmg than it did. I've seen it do like well over half of a health bar before
[2017-01-18 00:06:23 UTC] knightmare_29: Did he kill artorias?
[2017-01-18 00:06:27 UTC] tulliuscicero25: yeah that move didnt even phase him
[2017-01-18 00:06:27 UTC] gaylordbutthump: it's easiest if you take off her tail in one hit
[2017-01-18 00:06:29 UTC] retrocerberus: follow her footsteps in the snow
[2017-01-18 00:06:37 UTC] jaybird1983: m
[2017-01-18 00:06:41 UTC] popstradamus: Make her visible again by attacking her, then cut the tail
[2017-01-18 00:06:42 UTC] tulliuscicero25: nah i beat her fine
[2017-01-18 00:06:49 UTC] tulliuscicero25: just coulnd get het tail
[2017-01-18 00:06:53 UTC] iconicmaster1: Sounds hard
[2017-01-18 00:06:53 UTC] popstradamus: damn
[2017-01-18 00:07:01 UTC] tulliuscicero25: couldn't
[2017-01-18 00:07:55 UTC] tulliuscicero25: oh you can maker her visible?!
[2017-01-18 00:08:08 UTC] tulliuscicero25: she stayed invis whole fight for me
[2017-01-18 00:08:15 UTC] tulliuscicero25: thought it was odd
[2017-01-18 00:08:17 UTC] iconicmaster1: How you do that
[2017-01-18 00:08:22 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I didn't know you could do that
[2017-01-18 00:08:43 UTC] popstradamus: Yeah she shouldn't stay invis the whole fight. Did she for you?
[2017-01-18 00:08:53 UTC] rainbowcarnagee: am I early or late?
[2017-01-18 00:08:54 UTC] wetw0rk: There's a knack to getting her tail. Iirc I used a broken sword on it to weaken it, then used another weapon to cut it off. Something like that. I think if you go ham on her with your best weapon you'll kill her before the tail comes off.
[2017-01-18 00:08:59 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: when i fought here she did
[2017-01-18 00:09:06 UTC] tulliuscicero25: yeah i thought it was odd
[2017-01-18 00:09:29 UTC] iconicmaster1: Why she has a tail
[2017-01-18 00:09:43 UTC] popstradamus: Damn. Yeah when I've fought her she goes invis, I attack her a little bit, then she becomes visible again
[2017-01-18 00:09:45 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: because she is some kind of reptillian lol
[2017-01-18 00:09:51 UTC] tulliuscicero25: because shes a dragon waifu icon
[2017-01-18 00:09:58 UTC] popstradamus: @iconicmaster1, She's a crossbreed
[2017-01-18 00:10:02 UTC] tulliuscicero25: like the girls from ffxiv
[2017-01-18 00:10:05 UTC] retrocerberus: this one dude got me seath's tail for me, he didn't have too though,
[2017-01-18 00:10:26 UTC] iconicmaster1: Cross breed SeemsGood

[2017-01-18 19:56:09 UTC] shotinthedeep: Phil could probably finish the game this stream if he tried to
[2017-01-18 19:56:14 UTC] jackwhite2000: guys do you think Injustice 2 will be better than Stree fighter v?
[2017-01-18 19:56:25 UTC] jackwhite2000: street*
[2017-01-18 19:56:38 UTC] bethe2670: of course it will

[2017-01-18 19:56:46 UTC] kg1772: i thought the animation in injustice 1 was really odd. especially the dashes
[2017-01-18 19:56:49 UTC] jackwhite2000: thats the spirit
[2017-01-18 19:57:18 UTC] jackwhite2000: better question will marvel vs capcom infinite be better than sfv?
[2017-01-18 19:57:30 UTC] bethe2670: phil will finish dark souls today if he beats the dlc before break because he only has gwyn left
[2017-01-18 19:57:38 UTC] bethe2670: jack yeah
[2017-01-18 19:57:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: so today could be the end of your heel turn bethe
[2017-01-18 19:57:52 UTC] bethe2670: street fighter on launch was a piece of shit
[2017-01-18 19:57:57 UTC] jackwhite2000: tbh im skipping mvc infinite

[2017-01-18 19:58:37 UTC] jackwhite2000: capcom aint ripping me off a 4th time
[2017-01-18 19:59:02 UTC] bethe2670: i dont know if raeknub is here i havent seen him for ages, he might have a different name though
[2017-01-18 19:59:25 UTC] akioartorius: Ornstein is a electric leo so he is Luxray, Artorias is a dark grey wolf so he is Mightyena, Ciaran is a gold hornet with toxic sliver stinger so she is Beedrill, Gough is a Giant Hawk so he is Skyraptor. What do you guys think? Also I really want to see a Dark souls/ Fate Zero parody or crossover.
[2017-01-18 19:59:26 UTC] jackwhite2000: guys a question
[2017-01-18 19:59:35 UTC] bethe2670: 3 times ripping me off FUCK YOU CAPCOM not getting me a 4th time - jack

[2017-01-18 20:02:17 UTC] jackwhite2000: my internet crashed

[2017-01-18 20:02:24 UTC] jackwhite2000: dint even realise
[2017-01-18 20:02:44 UTC] shotinthedeep: Was it your router?
[2017-01-18 20:02:51 UTC] bethe2670: so if phil beat 2 bosses and still has 2 more left in this dlc does that mean he is half way through it already
[2017-01-18 20:03:00 UTC] jackwhite2000: nah it just disconnected and reconnected
[2017-01-18 20:03:05 UTC] bethe2670: oh no not the 'router'

[2017-01-18 20:04:42 UTC] jackwhite2000: if the rumors about the game running like shit on Wii U are true forget it
[2017-01-18 20:04:48 UTC] punishedmac: Gwyn will be a cinch m8
[2017-01-18 20:04:59 UTC] akioartorius: and then if Phil has time left, he can hold a pvp tournament kappa
[2017-01-18 20:05:02 UTC] bethe2670: it better not run like shit on the wii u
[2017-01-18 20:05:12 UTC] retrocerberus: dspCowboy
[2017-01-18 20:05:13 UTC] bethe2670: :D akio

[2017-01-18 20:06:16 UTC] jackwhite2000: tbh i may never buy a switch
[2017-01-18 20:06:23 UTC] shotinthedeep: No switch for me
[2017-01-18 20:06:32 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: hello guys
[2017-01-18 20:06:33 UTC] shotinthedeep: Especially not at $300

[2017-01-18 20:06:39 UTC] shotinthedeep: hi vidar
[2017-01-18 20:06:39 UTC] bethe2670: hello vidar
[2017-01-18 20:06:42 UTC] taurusoxford: Phil running late?

[2017-01-18 20:06:52 UTC] bethe2670: cheer
[2017-01-18 20:06:53 UTC] akioartorius: Phil was just here
[2017-01-18 20:07:02 UTC] shotinthedeep: he said hello a couple minutes ago
[2017-01-18 20:07:04 UTC] taurusoxford: oh, had to scroll up
[2017-01-18 20:07:06 UTC] kuroriku: what up chat?
[2017-01-18 20:07:10 UTC] bethe2670: hello
[2017-01-18 20:07:14 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah sure haha
[2017-01-18 20:07:34 UTC] shotinthedeep: Maybe we'll get to 200 today
[2017-01-18 20:07:46 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no way shotinthedeep
[2017-01-18 20:08:05 UTC] shotinthedeep: Only chance is if the DLC bosses get to him
[2017-01-18 20:08:28 UTC] jackwhite2000: besides zelda does the switch have any good launch titles?
[2017-01-18 20:08:41 UTC] akioartorius: if kahameet kills Phil a 100 times, the stream attendence with be at 800
[2017-01-18 20:08:42 UTC] taurusoxford: nope
[2017-01-18 20:08:43 UTC] kuroriku: SF2 Final Edition lol
[2017-01-18 20:08:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: is SF2 a launch title?
[2017-01-18 20:08:58 UTC] jackwhite2000: @kuroriku that aint a launch title
[2017-01-18 20:09:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah ty jack
[2017-01-18 20:09:02 UTC] kuroriku: or whatever they are calling when noone wanted that game
[2017-01-18 20:09:14 UTC] shotinthedeep: Maybe that's more reason for Phil to die an extra coule times akioartorius
[2017-01-18 20:09:25 UTC] kuroriku: @jackwhite2000, yeah im being tongue in cheek about it lol
[2017-01-18 20:09:44 UTC] theycallmejimbob: that would taint the legitimacy of the redemption run though shotinthedeep
[2017-01-18 20:10:01 UTC] jackwhite2000: also why do i have a feeling after 1 year all 3rd party companies will abandon the switch?
[2017-01-18 20:10:12 UTC] taurusoxford: because they will @jackwhite2000
[2017-01-18 20:10:19 UTC] shotinthedeep: ...but as long as he ends up winning by himself he finally redeems himself jimbob
[2017-01-18 20:10:43 UTC] theycallmejimbob: but that would compromise the "no bs" rule shotinthedeep
[2017-01-18 20:10:46 UTC] taurusoxford: Nobody is gonna waste time and money making games for something that can't even match vanilla PS4/XBone
[2017-01-18 20:10:47 UTC] jackwhite2000: @TaurusOxford the only ones who i think will stay with the switch are ubisoft and sega
[2017-01-18 20:10:53 UTC] kuroriku: @jackwhite2000, isnt that what happened with the wii u?
[2017-01-18 20:10:54 UTC] shotinthedeep: Oh that rule
[2017-01-18 20:11:02 UTC] jackwhite2000: @kuroriku yup
[2017-01-18 20:11:06 UTC] shotinthedeep: Is it still intact jimbob?
[2017-01-18 20:11:15 UTC] jackwhite2000: so the switch will pretty much be a wii u 2
[2017-01-18 20:11:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I believe so shotinthedeep
[2017-01-18 20:11:20 UTC] sokpatreon: woo
[2017-01-18 20:11:31 UTC] taurusoxford: Like, i'm positive the Switch would die trying to run something like FFXV
[2017-01-18 20:11:34 UTC] kuroriku: i just wish the joy cons werent so small. they are making that console for children and adults with small hands lol
[2017-01-18 20:11:38 UTC] akioartorius: if Phil summons a certain person, will it count against the redemption run because that person deserves some vengeance against a certain boss.
[2017-01-18 20:11:46 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I don't get it. If you are playing a RPG you would use the best equipement and scale your character as best as you can.
[2017-01-18 20:11:56 UTC] darksydephil: ok setting up the stream now
[2017-01-18 20:12:01 UTC] popsicolo: You guys hear that the CEO of Gearbox is so desperate to give Battleborn attention that he advertised a Battleborn r34 reddit?
[2017-01-18 20:12:02 UTC] akioartorius: ok Phil
[2017-01-18 20:12:05 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: hi phil
[2017-01-18 20:12:07 UTC] jackwhite2000: @TaurusOxford it would die trying to run COD lol
[2017-01-18 20:12:18 UTC] shotinthedeep: Yeah summoning is against the redemption run rules
[2017-01-18 20:12:23 UTC] thedoctor5437: yeah its pretty funny @Popsicolo
[2017-01-18 20:12:23 UTC] taurusoxford: @kuroriku those joycons look small in the hands of Japanese people. How the fuck is the average american gonna hold them?
[2017-01-18 20:12:39 UTC] jackwhite2000: brb
[2017-01-18 20:12:42 UTC] kuroriku: @TaurusOxford, they wont. they will have the use the "pro" controller >_>
[2017-01-18 20:12:50 UTC] taurusoxford: Only 70 dollars
[2017-01-18 20:12:54 UTC] thedoctor5437: I bet that he was the one who made the stories anyway ;)

[2017-01-18 20:13:22 UTC] taurusoxford: meanwhile I can get a DS4 on amazon for like 45\
[2017-01-18 20:13:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the first 2 threads in that forum Popsicolo after he linked to it :D
[2017-01-18 20:13:54 UTC] darksydephil: well pops, no sign of getting the new emote approved yet

[2017-01-18 20:14:05 UTC] darksydephil: and its incredibly dumb if they're holding it up only because i named it "sexy"
[2017-01-18 20:14:17 UTC] bethe2670: i wanna see the emote...
[2017-01-18 20:14:29 UTC] darksydephil: if they reject it, i'm going to go apeshit on them
[2017-01-18 20:14:42 UTC] popsicolo: Yeah seriously. Well it can't always happen super fast. Guess we'll see.

[2017-01-18 21:03:04 UTC] tofty1996: @Seantorious, You can only summon other people to help you as a human, and can only engage with pvp (generally) as a human
[2017-01-18 21:03:04 UTC] roman_spartan_: @mr_vidar_viking how do you know? did you even make it to late game without hand holding?
[2017-01-18 21:03:04 UTC] bethe2670: :P
[2017-01-18 21:03:13 UTC] ethershulk: @seantorious estus through kindeling and increased drop rate, I think not much benefit though

[2017-01-18 21:04:02 UTC] seantorious: They got rid of that after this Dark Souls right? Because I don't remember it in Dark Souls III
[2017-01-18 21:04:02 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: @roman_spartan_ if i didn't play the game my self I wouldn't aprechiate how good phil have become in this game

[2017-01-18 21:04:37 UTC] bethe2670: yes
[2017-01-18 21:04:42 UTC] kg1772: he should do demon souls redemption run without using the duplicate glitch for next redemption playthrough

[2017-01-18 21:04:48 UTC] bethe2670: he killed pricilla too
[2017-01-18 21:04:52 UTC] roman_spartan_: @mr_vidar_viking anyone who actually played the game would not be impressed with over leveling, BKH +5

[2017-01-18 21:05:11 UTC] 1buttondash: i don't dislike DS3, it was ok. it just didn't hold me. Bloodborne held me for so long thou, i played that game prolly 500 hours
[2017-01-18 21:05:12 UTC] roman_spartan_: @mr_vidar_viking his boss fight strategy is the same, tank hits, chug, spam R1

[2017-01-18 21:05:19 UTC] punishedmac: he nearly died to priscilla despite being incredibly overleveled for that boss
[2017-01-18 21:05:20 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: @roman_spartan_ yes they would. you have to be pretty elitist to think like that.
[2017-01-18 21:05:21 UTC] zagesaw: Bloodborne redemption run?
[2017-01-18 21:05:26 UTC] dyr0rah: soo entertaining Kappa
[2017-01-18 21:05:42 UTC] royal_phalanx91: DS3 is apparently similar to bloodborne in terms of gameplay, haven't got a PS4 tho
[2017-01-18 21:05:43 UTC] akioartorius: priscilla had the lifehunt scythe that causes bloodloss that is why
[2017-01-18 21:05:55 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: hey thats pretty good
[2017-01-18 21:05:56 UTC] soulrider95: If calling this run boring makes me elitist, then I am LUL

[2017-01-18 21:06:21 UTC] tofty1996: @mr_vidar_viking, actually Phil would have a lot harder time upgrading a standard weapon due to ember requirements, let's be real
[2017-01-18 21:06:22 UTC] popsicolo: I'M SORRY
[2017-01-18 21:06:23 UTC] lordnate1991: I felt like it resembled bloodborne more then the others

[2017-01-18 21:06:56 UTC] gaylordbutthump: jesus, he hasn't been invaded in oolacile yet? this game really is dead on 360
[2017-01-18 21:06:58 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: @roman_spartan_ not until late in the game
[2017-01-18 21:06:59 UTC] tofty1996: @mr_vidar_viking, I don't blame him for finding and using the BKH but let's not pretend it hasn't had a pretty big impact on this run, especially the early to mid game
[2017-01-18 21:07:05 UTC] bethe2670: really manus is first? thought he was last
[2017-01-18 21:07:10 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: still using his shield more than last few DS runs
[2017-01-18 21:07:12 UTC] soulrider95: mr_vidar_viking, Implying I'm not just watching this on my 3rd monitor while playing games / music on the other Kappa
[2017-01-18 21:07:13 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: ie once :P
[2017-01-18 21:07:20 UTC] kg1772: @ZAGESAW hopefully demon souls- without glitch run
[2017-01-18 21:07:23 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: @tofty1996 he got it early he got dealt a good hand, no way you fold that
[2017-01-18 21:07:27 UTC] aleandspirits: gaylord, invaders will be too high level, the meta is level 100 and level 120
[2017-01-18 21:07:29 UTC] royal_phalanx91: PC is the definitive version of the game, I think you can still find people
[2017-01-18 21:07:39 UTC] iconicmaster1: Nina Hartley Kreygasm
[2017-01-18 21:07:41 UTC] roman_spartan_: @mr_vidar_viking anor londo is not late in the game. Also BKH un-upgraded can easily carry anyone up to that point. As should be obvious now after watching phil
[2017-01-18 21:07:42 UTC] akioartorius: do we need a BB redemption run? a BB dlc redemption run prob but not the main game
[2017-01-18 21:07:42 UTC] lordnate1991: also there are some on ps3
[2017-01-18 21:07:43 UTC] soulrider95: I always did SL60 PVP
[2017-01-18 21:07:44 UTC] kingjadvcmp: hang on, did you just try to argue it'd be elitist viking? can I challenge your opinion? (or will you just silence me again)
[2017-01-18 21:07:48 UTC] nerv117: lol
[2017-01-18 21:07:53 UTC] 1buttondash: @iconicmaster1 she's granny status now
[2017-01-18 21:08:02 UTC] roman_spartan_: @KingjadVCMP yeah i'm surprised i'm not banned yet
[2017-01-18 21:08:03 UTC] is_nation: no but most people would say "This weapon is op, i won't use it so things will be more entertaining"
[2017-01-18 21:08:11 UTC] aleandspirits: stop arguing you bizarre people
[2017-01-18 21:08:14 UTC] bethe2670: granny WutFace
[2017-01-18 21:08:14 UTC] tofty1996: @mr_vidar_viking, I agree, not his fault, he didn't farm for it and he's right when he says From put an OP weapon in, just saying that the impact of that weapon early to mid game is undeniable
[2017-01-18 21:08:18 UTC] is_nation: not "I'ma walk forward and everything will die"
[2017-01-18 21:08:20 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil is not here to entertain, he's a gamer. He's made that quite clear
[2017-01-18 21:08:23 UTC] rbreezay: Need more names. For research purpose of course
[2017-01-18 21:08:25 UTC] iconicmaster1: @1buttondash still a hottie to me
[2017-01-18 21:08:37 UTC] is_nation: @KingjadVCMP true dat
[2017-01-18 21:08:38 UTC] 1buttondash: you sick freak
[2017-01-18 21:08:44 UTC] iconicmaster1: SeemsGood
[2017-01-18 21:08:54 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: @tofty1986 and usually when you play a RPG you always use the best tings available to you if you're not doing some special challenge
[2017-01-18 21:08:54 UTC] babbyrage: he rekt artorias first try? lol
[2017-01-18 21:08:57 UTC] royal_phalanx91: This BKH argument is beating a dead horse
[2017-01-18 21:08:58 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: so...phil doesnt think he is entertaining?
[2017-01-18 21:09:00 UTC] tofty1996: If Phil didn't get it and had a normal weapon upgrade path he would be stuck on a +10 standard weapon all the way up until he beat 4 Kings which is when he found the ember
[2017-01-18 21:09:13 UTC] akioartorius: yes, phil rekt artorias first try with bkh
[2017-01-18 21:09:24 UTC] xgameofpwns: Sup chat! Did Phil ffight Kalameet?
[2017-01-18 21:09:26 UTC] bethe2670: gamers who record videos for youtube usually do it to entertain people
[2017-01-18 21:09:28 UTC] indicansent: @KingjadVCMP I disagree; he originally said this was gonna be a playthrough for the fans AND "detractors"; he hyped up the rage and fails, that's something you only do if you're aiming to entertain
[2017-01-18 21:09:29 UTC] is_nation: @mr_viar_viking usually you're not doing it for the entertainment for other people to keep them watching
[2017-01-18 21:09:30 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I blame from for not patching that shit honestly
[2017-01-18 21:09:31 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: @royall_phalanx91 yes so much it is so stupid. most weapons would reach a big potential eventually
[2017-01-18 21:09:32 UTC] akioartorius: but Phil almost died
[2017-01-18 21:09:44 UTC] 1buttondash: this place was wierd, is this supposed to be the undead burg>?
[2017-01-18 21:09:47 UTC] tofty1996: @mr_vidar_viking, I think you're misinterpreting what I'm saying, I don't blame him for using it, he got a good drop so he used it which is fair, just impacts the early to mid game so much because of its huge base damage and easy upgrades
[2017-01-18 21:09:54 UTC] royal_phalanx91: He had 20 estus for that fight
[2017-01-18 21:09:56 UTC] soulrider95: Most weapons aren't BKH level even at +10
[2017-01-18 21:09:59 UTC] ethershulk: jester hype
[2017-01-18 21:10:07 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I'd be catering to the detractor market with rage :P
[2017-01-18 21:10:09 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I'm still using a regular longsword in DS3
[2017-01-18 21:10:12 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: views are views right
[2017-01-18 21:10:15 UTC] roman_spartan_: @mr_vidar_viking BKH reaches big potential as soon as you pick it up and can use it. no upgrades needed until late game. And not Anor Londo "late game"
[2017-01-18 21:10:16 UTC] akioartorius: royal, and he ended up with only 3 left
[2017-01-18 21:10:17 UTC] iconicmaster1: Is there a way to fight Priscilla without her going invisible
[2017-01-18 21:10:23 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: yeah
[2017-01-18 21:10:24 UTC] bethe2670: mimic :D
[2017-01-18 21:10:25 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: git gud
[2017-01-18 21:10:26 UTC] popsicolo: VERY GOOD
[2017-01-18 21:10:31 UTC] bethe2670: they look so beautiful
[2017-01-18 21:10:33 UTC] renaofnight: i find it silly that there are two different groups for phil lul
[2017-01-18 21:10:34 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: exactly popsicolo
[2017-01-18 21:10:35 UTC] kingjadvcmp: hey Nation have you had a disgruntled whisper yet from a certain someone?
[2017-01-18 21:10:37 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: git very good
[2017-01-18 21:10:37 UTC] akioartorius: yes best item kappa
[2017-01-18 21:10:45 UTC] rbreezay: Vury good
[2017-01-18 21:10:48 UTC] bethe2670: dspSexy this emote is VERY GOOD
[2017-01-18 21:10:49 UTC] royal_phalanx91: OHHHH
[2017-01-18 21:10:50 UTC] indicansent: So if his goal was to entertain, and he knew BKH was overpowered, and that it being overpowered would let him steamroll the game, and that steamrolling DS isn't that entertaining, then he'd at the very least switch to different weapons to make up for that
[2017-01-18 21:10:51 UTC] popsicolo: BLOODBORNE DUMASS
[2017-01-18 21:10:52 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: @toftly1996 absolutely i agree, but there are this reteards that mean the weapon is too overpowered it's not
[2017-01-18 21:10:55 UTC] is_nation: @KingjadVCMP no not yet. Give it time
[2017-01-18 21:10:55 UTC] royal_phalanx91: INVASION
[2017-01-18 21:10:56 UTC] akioartorius: npc invader
[2017-01-18 21:10:59 UTC] iconicmaster1: Very good emote
[2017-01-18 21:10:59 UTC] rbreezay: YES
[2017-01-18 21:11:05 UTC] auxitius: so hard
[2017-01-18 21:11:09 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Wow that dude got fucked
[2017-01-18 21:11:11 UTC] is_nation: wow
[2017-01-18 21:11:14 UTC] tofty1996: anyway I've had this argument before, I still watch and enjoy the playthrough, just a bit of a shame that some of the more difficult areas of the game are made kind of easy with such huge damage early on
[2017-01-18 21:11:15 UTC] emnay_i_say: Game's too easy. LUL
[2017-01-18 21:11:16 UTC] ethershulk: ye UWot
[2017-01-18 21:11:16 UTC] bethe2670: dark souls DUMASS vs bloodborne DUMASS = ???
[2017-01-18 21:11:19 UTC] royal_phalanx91: NPC? oh
[2017-01-18 21:11:19 UTC] xspheerx: Rekt lol
[2017-01-18 21:11:19 UTC] rbreezay: Woooooow dude
[2017-01-18 21:11:20 UTC] bobbi_ling: still bkh salt this far into the game
[2017-01-18 21:11:23 UTC] reversehollow: ng is such a disappointment sometimes
[2017-01-18 21:11:24 UTC] royal_phalanx91: nvm then lol
[2017-01-18 21:11:26 UTC] retrocerberus: dspGlitch he went back home to bloodborne
[2017-01-18 21:11:28 UTC] roman_spartan_: man what a an awesome entertaining fight, he walks up, tanks hit and hits RB -> RB -> RB -> RB -> dead
[2017-01-18 21:11:36 UTC] akioartorius: isn't that the merchant from before the artorias fight? the npc invader i mean
[2017-01-18 21:11:37 UTC] kg1772: BKH wrecks.....zzZZzzZz
[2017-01-18 21:11:38 UTC] bobbi_ling: get out then
[2017-01-18 21:11:38 UTC] kelsper: indeed
[2017-01-18 21:11:42 UTC] dxfreedom: He killed sif in 10 hits. Look it up. 10 hits....!
[2017-01-18 21:11:44 UTC] vawugz: look at how much he dodgeadnd blocked
[2017-01-18 21:11:51 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: thats a generic monster though
[2017-01-18 21:11:53 UTC] is_nation: tank hits, RB spam, ???, Profit
[2017-01-18 21:11:53 UTC] xgameofpwns: It's not BKH but the massive amount of poise that has made the recent fights easy.
[2017-01-18 21:11:55 UTC] 1buttondash: didn't that BP drop an item?
[2017-01-18 21:11:56 UTC] zylluz: dark magic LUL
[2017-01-18 21:11:57 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: AnorLondo is pretty hard tot get to I think. I struggeled with it. And it is not very early in the game at all
[2017-01-18 21:12:01 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil would probably get a decent turnout for trying to do a redemption Bloodborne run, but he's clearly against it. Then again he was clearly against twitch...things change
[2017-01-18 21:12:14 UTC] tofty1996: @Xgameofpwns, Artorias was made easy by the greatshield and huge endurance
[2017-01-18 21:12:19 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: if your not 3 hitting generic monsters this stage in the game you're probably levelling up wrong
[2017-01-18 21:12:24 UTC] bobbi_ling: imagaine attacking with rb who would ever do that Kappa
[2017-01-18 21:12:24 UTC] aleandspirits: anor londo is what seperates the men from the boys in the first game
[2017-01-18 21:12:28 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Why does Phil not want to go through bloodborne again?
[2017-01-18 21:12:32 UTC] aleandspirits: like the smelter demon in dark souls 2
[2017-01-18 21:12:34 UTC] popsicolo: TRASH
[2017-01-18 21:12:35 UTC] tofty1996: @Xgameofpwns, you don't typically block against artorias since he eats all of your stamina but Phil was fine
[2017-01-18 21:12:36 UTC] xspheerx: Imagine , just howmany people have died in this area lol
[2017-01-18 21:12:37 UTC] auxitius: Because it's ACTUALLY hard
[2017-01-18 21:12:38 UTC] nerv117: lol 1 shotting this guys
[2017-01-18 21:12:40 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: ikr you should be usting RT
[2017-01-18 21:12:42 UTC] ethershulk: LITTER
[2017-01-18 21:12:43 UTC] roman_spartan_: it's the middle of the game, and it's hardly a struggle after your first play through or if you get an OP weapon
[2017-01-18 21:12:50 UTC] reversehollow: @royal_phalanx91 Lack of armour/greatshield lol
[2017-01-18 21:12:56 UTC] is_nation: @Royal_Phalanx91 too hard and he sold it
[2017-01-18 21:13:00 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Would you guys not have much of a problem with his Black Knight Halberd if he wasn't using havels+greatshield and tried to rely on dodge rolling?
[2017-01-18 21:13:01 UTC] doctormaul: @kingjadvcmp did Phil finish Bloodborn?
[2017-01-18 21:13:04 UTC] auxitius: nope
[2017-01-18 21:13:07 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I heard he still had it
[2017-01-18 21:13:07 UTC] bobbi_ling: yes
[2017-01-18 21:13:07 UTC] bethe2670: i would NEVER attack with RB because i dont play xbox
[2017-01-18 21:13:12 UTC] akioartorius: royal, phil said he doesn't have the dlc installed anymore or the save files so he will have to replay the entire game to get to the dlc.
[2017-01-18 21:13:12 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I got through this part easy
[2017-01-18 21:13:17 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: @roman_spartan bullshit. I got some BK weapons my first run, it wasn't a ticket to easy game play
[2017-01-18 21:13:19 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: fuck off
[2017-01-18 21:13:22 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: no op weapons or armour
[2017-01-18 21:13:23 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Perfect for a redemption run then
[2017-01-18 21:13:24 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I honestly do not know if Phil finished bloodborne...
[2017-01-18 21:13:24 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: and I suck at DS
[2017-01-18 21:13:29 UTC] is_nation: @LemonPlaysGames it'd help
[2017-01-18 21:13:33 UTC] renaofnight: quick question, does subbing give anything from his patreon?
[2017-01-18 21:13:34 UTC] zagesaw: he could fight Ludwig right after killing Vicar Amelia
[2017-01-18 21:13:34 UTC] dxfreedom: Bloodborne is such a fantastic game. A redemption run there would be epic.
[2017-01-18 21:13:36 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: you need to git gud
[2017-01-18 21:13:36 UTC] seraphic17: Replay all 40 minutes of it. Grueling Kappa
[2017-01-18 21:13:37 UTC] renaofnight: just curious~
[2017-01-18 21:13:39 UTC] kg1772: @LemonPlaysGames if he dropped the greatshield, dropped havels, and 2 handed BKH would be more entertaining. but he relys on it all
[2017-01-18 21:13:39 UTC] 1buttondash: when's Nioh come out?
[2017-01-18 21:13:40 UTC] ethershulk: xbox is dead after the spellbound cancellation SuperVinlin
[2017-01-18 21:13:42 UTC] kingjadvcmp: viking, you should not be so rude to the viewers
[2017-01-18 21:13:42 UTC] aleandspirits: the problem people are having isn't the weapon, its that the combat encounters are generally very dull
[2017-01-18 21:13:47 UTC] soulrider95: mr_vidar_viking, just cuz you're not good doesn't mean the game isn't easy LUL
[2017-01-18 21:13:53 UTC] popsicolo: Phil finished Bloodborne sans DLC and Chalice Dungeons
[2017-01-18 21:13:53 UTC] taurusoxford: @EtherShulk you mean scalebound
[2017-01-18 21:13:57 UTC] soulrider95: Kappa
[2017-01-18 21:13:59 UTC] akioartorius: 1ButtonDash, Phil mentioned it in his calender vid
[2017-01-18 21:14:00 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: exactly
[2017-01-18 21:14:01 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: @kingjadvcmp you should not be so rude to me
[2017-01-18 21:14:03 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: git gud
[2017-01-18 21:14:04 UTC] naddodr: the BKH is by far the best black knight weapon tho
[2017-01-18 21:14:06 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: like I keep saying
[2017-01-18 21:14:07 UTC] gaylordbutthump: are there people here who actually think the game is hard
[2017-01-18 21:14:09 UTC] kingjadvcmp: when was I rude to you tonight, viking?
[2017-01-18 21:14:14 UTC] gaylordbutthump: LUL
[2017-01-18 21:14:18 UTC] aleandspirits: is it fuck
[2017-01-18 21:14:18 UTC] reversehollow: Bloodborne be hard, Orphan on bl4 is ridonkulous.
[2017-01-18 21:14:20 UTC] tofty1996: lol
[2017-01-18 21:14:23 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: the first time through darksouls it is normal to use 100 hours
[2017-01-18 21:14:25 UTC] punishedmac: Dude, don't be telling people to fuck off and accuse them of being rude to you lol
[2017-01-18 21:14:25 UTC] bobbi_ling: dks2 is harder
[2017-01-18 21:14:26 UTC] aleandspirits: ultra great sword and great axe
[2017-01-18 21:14:28 UTC] bethe2670: xbox exclusives will cease to exist after a while, they keep getting cancelled i feel bad for microsoft and xbone

[2017-01-18 21:14:31 UTC] ethershulk: @taurusoxford my bad. I was thinking of a song while writing the message.
[2017-01-18 21:14:31 UTC] aleandspirits: much more fun
[2017-01-18 21:14:31 UTC] dxfreedom: The DLC of Bloodborne was fantastic. Best fights of the game are in the dlc imo
[2017-01-18 21:14:33 UTC] stillbornsoccer: the games hard for beginners. once you know how to play it gets ez
[2017-01-18 21:14:34 UTC] xgameofpwns: BKS is actually a tough weapon to use in a first playthrough. It's pretty slow but doesn't have the built in poise that BKUGS and BKGA have
[2017-01-18 21:14:34 UTC] marshmelons: oh yeh, he ragequit two bosses in bloodborne. I guess that makes bloodborne the hardest game in the series
[2017-01-18 21:14:34 UTC] seraphic17: I think Dark Souls is hard
[2017-01-18 21:14:37 UTC] soulrider95: 100 hours is hardly normal what you talkin bout
[2017-01-18 21:14:43 UTC] tofty1996: My first 2 playthroughs were super tough for me, then I learned the combat and now do super restrictive challenge runs for fun and it's still ez
[2017-01-18 21:14:43 UTC] ukyo9: My... guiding.. moonlight
[2017-01-18 21:14:44 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I wish viking was more like Popsic, he's a good mod.
[2017-01-18 21:14:48 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I want to buy a PS4 actually once I get more money
[2017-01-18 21:14:51 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: read soms statistics @soulrider95
[2017-01-18 21:14:53 UTC] reversehollow: @bobbi_ling That's not a working title Kappa
[2017-01-18 21:14:54 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: um no
[2017-01-18 21:14:58 UTC] doctormaul: That's the biggest problems of let's playing games real early. Patches and dlc are missed
[2017-01-18 21:15:00 UTC] kingjadvcmp: didn't have to get his wallet out to be a mod either :P
[2017-01-18 21:15:03 UTC] is_nation: @Popsicolo phil never beat the bloodborne dlc
[2017-01-18 21:15:09 UTC] popsicolo: Correct
[2017-01-18 21:15:09 UTC] soulrider95: you got a link for that? Everyone I know spent like 40-60 hours on their first run of a souls game
[2017-01-18 21:15:10 UTC] akioartorius: lol
[2017-01-18 21:15:11 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: a completionist run can easy take 300 hours
[2017-01-18 21:15:12 UTC] bethe2670: that worked
[2017-01-18 21:15:12 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: more like 40 - 50 first run

[2017-01-18 21:20:01 UTC] akioartorius: lvl 80
[2017-01-18 21:20:02 UTC] iconicmaster1: It's backwards compatible

[2017-01-18 21:20:08 UTC] aleandspirits: you can only be invaded by people a lower level than you and the meta for this area is 100/120
[2017-01-18 21:20:10 UTC] punishedmac: plus consolol
[2017-01-18 21:20:17 UTC] gaylordbutthump: npc invasions don't count against the timer
[2017-01-18 21:20:18 UTC] bartboulderdash: Yeah, most people in this area are 100+
[2017-01-18 21:20:19 UTC] akioartorius: chester was a npc invader
[2017-01-18 21:20:19 UTC] usojin: theres only a waiting period if he died
[2017-01-18 21:20:19 UTC] is_nation: @Tofty1996 i think many people wish he never found it lol Or at least never used it because he knew it was OP but oh well.
[2017-01-18 21:20:23 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I have a few friends playing the game also. And as far as i know they are not retarded. 90 hours are not bad for a first run thorugh dark souls
[2017-01-18 21:20:32 UTC] tofty1996: you can be invaded by higher levels, it's 10 levels + 10% of your level lower I believe
[2017-01-18 21:20:35 UTC] kelsper: didn't know npcs don't count for that, huh
[2017-01-18 21:20:40 UTC] punishedmac: 90 hours for ds1? That's pretty long
[2017-01-18 21:20:42 UTC] sureflight: pvp is +-10 lvls +10% so he can be invaded from low 70's to nearly 110
[2017-01-18 21:21:06 UTC] is_nation: @mr_vidar_viking 90 though. 90 hours. To get to Gwyn. I still can't see how that is possible
[2017-01-18 21:21:07 UTC] punishedmac: iirc my first run was like 24 hours or so
[2017-01-18 21:21:08 UTC] zagesaw: this game is pretty dead on 360 if he's playing online
[2017-01-18 21:21:17 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: are they grinding
[2017-01-18 21:21:20 UTC] bethe2670: i hate waking up in the middle of the night and wanting to have a shit and then i cant gt back to sleep after shitting...so annoying
[2017-01-18 21:21:28 UTC] sureflight: 90 hours is bad for a first run, i dont know a single person that was over 40 hours for DS1 first run
[2017-01-18 21:21:30 UTC] steeltarkus: I took 80 hours my first run, but this was out of massive exploration of everything in the game, like pointlessly so
[2017-01-18 21:21:30 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: thats the only way I could see 90 hours being feasible
[2017-01-18 21:21:31 UTC] shekelbergosteinwitz: CuteDog

[2017-01-18 22:11:28 UTC] 1buttondash: did the giant shoot his bow? if he didn't he won't be able to beat kalameet
[2017-01-18 22:11:28 UTC] runkiman: @Senalk0, obviously not, then it would start over
[2017-01-18 22:11:32 UTC] retrocerberus: dspGlitch I'm proud of you phil..
[2017-01-18 22:11:33 UTC] dxfreedom: Phil can, at this point, face tank anything that dragon can do and rek him
[2017-01-18 22:11:42 UTC] is_nation: tank through kalameet's fire
[2017-01-18 22:11:46 UTC] punishedmac: he needs to draw kalameet out first
[2017-01-18 22:11:49 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: Phil should get the tail cut

[2017-01-18 22:12:09 UTC] senalk0: @Runkiman obviously you can kil gwyn and still play dlc after
[2017-01-18 22:12:10 UTC] d1mech: is havel the best armour in the game?

[2017-01-18 22:12:37 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: havel isn't the best armour if you don't have the stats to wear it lol
[2017-01-18 22:12:40 UTC] is_nation: stand infront of the dragon and eat ALL the damage
[2017-01-18 22:12:42 UTC] rbreezay: Cut da tail!
[2017-01-18 22:12:43 UTC] tofty1996: I actually found Kalameet harder on my first run of the DLC surprisingly
[2017-01-18 22:12:45 UTC] retrocerberus: phils new nickname "One-Shot Phil"
[2017-01-18 22:12:48 UTC] 1buttondash: Gywn wasn't ever that hard tbh

[2017-01-18 22:13:04 UTC] auxitius: gotto read a guide boi
[2017-01-18 22:13:06 UTC] 17max93: why should he cut the tail?
[2017-01-18 22:13:08 UTC] darkcookie2809: first try phil actually
[2017-01-18 22:13:11 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: For swag sword
[2017-01-18 22:13:12 UTC] bethe2670: should've killed kalameet now
[2017-01-18 22:13:12 UTC] nerv117: yep thats it
[2017-01-18 22:13:15 UTC] bobbi_ling: overpriced dlc done already
[2017-01-18 22:13:16 UTC] rbreezay: Phils about to read a guide
[2017-01-18 22:13:18 UTC] bethe2670: then went for a break
[2017-01-18 22:13:20 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: And Phil is basically running a vit gauge
[2017-01-18 22:13:24 UTC] tengu_stoner: weekee time
[2017-01-18 22:13:24 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: It would match him well
[2017-01-18 22:13:26 UTC] gaylordbutthump: he's only been playing an hour LUL
[2017-01-18 22:13:28 UTC] nucleararcade: ScaredyCat

[2017-01-18 22:13:34 UTC] bethe2670: bobbi yep it only took him like 2 hours lol
[2017-01-18 22:13:37 UTC] lonestar19: I like how he pauses the game like that'll do anything
[2017-01-18 22:13:56 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: He saved at the bonfire
[2017-01-18 22:14:10 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @lonestar19, Force of habit most likely, he's not a souls streamer after all.
[2017-01-18 22:14:10 UTC] retrocerberus: you realize that the controller phil was using was an nintendo 64 controller and someone unseen was playing it the whole time
[2017-01-18 22:14:22 UTC] str33m: lol
[2017-01-18 22:14:30 UTC] lonestar19: I know just teasing him lmao
[2017-01-18 22:14:32 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Kalameet pls kill
[2017-01-18 22:15:01 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Nah, this style of play is def phils
[2017-01-18 22:15:05 UTC] tulliuscicero25: nah hes reached critical mass for phil proof
[2017-01-18 22:15:05 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: If he oneshots Kalameet, he should fight Gwyn with the Calamity ring
[2017-01-18 22:15:08 UTC] punishedmac: It's not all bad. The fact he died at all with that setup is pretty impressive
[2017-01-18 22:15:13 UTC] bobbi_ling: i dont think havel is good for kalameet
[2017-01-18 22:15:23 UTC] bethe2670: so :P
[2017-01-18 22:15:25 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Tanked everything and overpower with gear and stats
[2017-01-18 22:15:31 UTC] naddodr: yeah he should not have this high a death count at all lol
[2017-01-18 22:15:35 UTC] retrocerberus: yeah, kalameet is a fast f***
[2017-01-18 22:15:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: RetroCerberus, you're lucky you're subbed with that banter :P
[2017-01-18 22:15:42 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @bobbi_ling He'll still beat him easily.
[2017-01-18 22:15:44 UTC] tulliuscicero25: he doesnt even have to roll anymore lol
[2017-01-18 22:15:48 UTC] gaylordbutthump: yeah, i don't know how he manages to still die with that armor, weapon and shield
[2017-01-18 22:15:51 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: Capra Demon and the Skeletons are to blame for that
[2017-01-18 22:15:58 UTC] lokizarro: BKH is the main problem, it's really strong out of the box.
[2017-01-18 22:15:59 UTC] sickvenom215: Or dodge or come up with any tactics
[2017-01-18 22:16:06 UTC] royal_phalanx91: When he didn't have OP shit he died a lot
[2017-01-18 22:16:06 UTC] sickvenom215: Just stand and swing away
[2017-01-18 22:16:09 UTC] auxitius: never overestimate phil
[2017-01-18 22:16:11 UTC] reversehollow: His playstyle for this run is legit, i'm a fan.
[2017-01-18 22:16:11 UTC] retrocerberus: theycallmejimbob what can I say, I aim to please
[2017-01-18 22:16:12 UTC] dankedan: the sound of that water
[2017-01-18 22:16:13 UTC] punishedmac: he's died almost 100 times since he started using BKH though lol
[2017-01-18 22:16:15 UTC] dankedan: must be pissing
[2017-01-18 22:16:18 UTC] lokizarro: Our of the box and upgrading it is easy, it isn't the best weapon though like people have been claiming, but that'll depend on your preference
[2017-01-18 22:16:23 UTC] royal_phalanx91: The problem now is havel's armor
[2017-01-18 22:16:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it made me laugh anyway RetroCerberus :D
[2017-01-18 22:16:24 UTC] ukyo9: I do kinda agree that it's really beating a dead horse by now. The playthrough is over and phil will likely kill Gwyn today.
[2017-01-18 22:16:27 UTC] lokizarro: In terms of damage it is NOT the best option though
[2017-01-18 22:16:28 UTC] ps3fanboy23: Is he cheese the game
[2017-01-18 22:16:29 UTC] royal_phalanx91: And BKH is too strong
[2017-01-18 22:16:30 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: the BKH is a problem stop complaining about bullshit
[2017-01-18 22:16:37 UTC] slurmdrinker: dspSexy
[2017-01-18 22:16:44 UTC] gerogethedamaja: It's probably the best weapon for NG tbh
[2017-01-18 22:16:51 UTC] darksydephil: LOL some other streamer or YTer complained to their fans that they're banned in this chat but have never talked in it
[2017-01-18 22:16:51 UTC] is_nation: stop complaining and only praise
[2017-01-18 22:16:56 UTC] darksydephil: that's literally impossible
[2017-01-18 22:17:00 UTC] lokizarro: It's a great choice, wouldn't call it the best though.
[2017-01-18 22:17:04 UTC] is_nation: youtuber?
[2017-01-18 22:17:04 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: The BKH drop was legit, though. He would've made himself a +15 weapon at some point, or a chaos/lightning weapon
[2017-01-18 22:17:05 UTC] is_nation: wut
[2017-01-18 22:17:06 UTC] tulliuscicero25: is velkas rapier good lokizarro

[2017-01-18 22:17:17 UTC] darksydephil: no idea who that is
[2017-01-18 22:17:19 UTC] retrocerberus: it was me phil.. I fucked that chicken
[2017-01-18 22:17:23 UTC] is_nation: OnlyAfro is banned here?
[2017-01-18 22:17:24 UTC] sickvenom215: Phil people are getting banned here a lot for no reason half the time
[2017-01-18 22:17:26 UTC] retrocerberus: dspGlitch
[2017-01-18 22:17:27 UTC] is_nation: why?
[2017-01-18 22:17:27 UTC] gaylordbutthump: onlyafro is your biggest fan
[2017-01-18 22:17:28 UTC] lokizarro: Velka's rapier is ok for a Dex Int build but not really great, can't be buffed either
[2017-01-18 22:17:33 UTC] ukyo9: Onlyafro is amazing tho
[2017-01-18 22:17:34 UTC] punishedmac: There's a reason any% speedruns use BKH
[2017-01-18 22:17:34 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I haven't seen a only afro here
[2017-01-18 22:17:35 UTC] bobbi_ling: hes a dark souls guy
[2017-01-18 22:17:35 UTC] slashingtomcat: how do you not no onlyafro?

[2017-01-18 22:17:46 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil they're people getting deleted like crazy in this chat at times.It feels like Matt Hardy is in charge
[2017-01-18 22:17:46 UTC] ps3fanboy23: Hey about phill your goals are almost there
[2017-01-18 22:17:47 UTC] dxfreedom: there was a banning spree this session though
[2017-01-18 22:17:47 UTC] slurmdrinker: OnlyAfro, that guy who made some funny Dark Souls vids
[2017-01-18 22:17:49 UTC] beanie5181: I didn't know Phil made soap Keepo
[2017-01-18 22:17:50 UTC] khawaja7: why would a guy like OnlyAfro would come here?
[2017-01-18 22:17:59 UTC] ukyo9: Holy shit nightbot, calm down, I just posted some dots :D

[2017-01-18 22:18:12 UTC] retrocerberus: yeah nightbot is an ass with dots
[2017-01-18 22:18:15 UTC] darksydephil: well apparently he tried to come here today and tweeted that he's banned so his followers of course are making jokes etc.
[2017-01-18 22:18:19 UTC] bobbi_ling: afro has used phils voice in a few clips
[2017-01-18 22:18:23 UTC] gaylordbutthump: pretty much all his vids have dsp soundbytes
[2017-01-18 22:18:24 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: there was no banning spree this session bullshit-.
[2017-01-18 22:18:27 UTC] slashingtomcat: OnlyAfro made the giant dd build

[2017-01-18 22:18:54 UTC] naddodr: just looked at his channel and omg it's aids
[2017-01-18 22:18:55 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: they got timed out

[2017-01-18 22:19:13 UTC] slurmdrinker: @DarksydePhil, your mods do go crazy with the banning sometimes.
[2017-01-18 22:19:15 UTC] naddodr: how on earth can that guy get so many views
[2017-01-18 22:19:16 UTC] vivalasnes: Kappa

[2017-01-18 22:19:27 UTC] retrocerberus: i keep my jokes tame, tasteful, yet out there
[2017-01-18 22:19:33 UTC] darksydephil: anyway, do you guys see my point about this game though? why are normal enemies 1-2 shotting me dead randomly but Manus can't kill me? lol
[2017-01-18 22:19:35 UTC] beanie5181: Why can't we be friends why can't we be friends.. Keepo
[2017-01-18 22:19:37 UTC] darksydephil: its not scaled properly at all
[2017-01-18 22:19:39 UTC] lokizarro: Slashingtomcat, it does get to a critical point like Swatting which is pathetic, but namecalling over the internet and bringing up the "fap situation" is ridiculous and silly
[2017-01-18 22:19:47 UTC] nerv117: dspSexy
[2017-01-18 22:19:55 UTC] retrocerberus: sexyDsp
[2017-01-18 22:19:56 UTC] vivalasnes: Phil what's your Hex color code?
[2017-01-18 22:19:58 UTC] retrocerberus: damn it

[2017-01-18 22:20:15 UTC] kg1772: I got timed for saying cheese souls.....wut
[2017-01-18 22:20:22 UTC] slashingtomcat: @Lokizarro because of the *** videos his videos are on the 2nd page of youtube
[2017-01-18 22:20:24 UTC] khoroshiy: me too
[2017-01-18 22:20:25 UTC] lokizarro: It is scaled well, it's just your weapon and armor is great our of the box, and it doesn't have great dark resistance, try eating one of Manus's to the face dark magic attacks without blocking.
[2017-01-18 22:20:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it's not the bot that is doing it ps3
[2017-01-18 22:20:30 UTC] slurmdrinker: Yeah the dark magic in this part is pretty heavy hitting
[2017-01-18 22:20:31 UTC] mrmarlboroz: No i dont see it, u just got surrounded and gangbanged
[2017-01-18 22:20:31 UTC] ps3fanboy23: Do you guy think phill is faping
[2017-01-18 22:20:32 UTC] auxitius: i got banned for saying triggered
[2017-01-18 22:20:37 UTC] maaduno: phil play dark souls 2 scholar version , would be better redemption run, shield is not that good there , so is lightning spear , lots of stuff fixed scaled:P would be hard and funny
[2017-01-18 22:20:37 UTC] lokizarro: You will die the same way you did to the dark mages
[2017-01-18 22:20:55 UTC] lokizarro: You weren't blocking against them, you were blocking most of the time with Manus, I think you blocked all of his magic attacks actually
[2017-01-18 22:20:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Auxitius, "cahman dood" was my crime
[2017-01-18 22:20:57 UTC] tulliuscicero25: dark magic kinda crazy in 1 yeah

[2017-01-18 22:21:23 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I did not notice
[2017-01-18 22:21:27 UTC] kg1772: @theycallmejimbob timing out people who are regulars even in YT chat.....power crazy
[2017-01-18 22:21:31 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: that was obviously a mistake
[2017-01-18 22:21:37 UTC] ps3fanboy23: guy is phill have is hand held
[2017-01-18 22:21:42 UTC] bonvoyagee3: yes
[2017-01-18 22:21:46 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: youtube chat? I don't know what this is
[2017-01-18 22:21:49 UTC] is_nation: Obviously
[2017-01-18 22:21:53 UTC] chaosalltheway: @Maaduno what is a good weapon for DS2 run?
[2017-01-18 22:22:10 UTC] dukesdearfreja: Vidar
[2017-01-18 22:22:10 UTC] is_nation: @Chaosalltheway Caestus
[2017-01-18 22:22:12 UTC] kg1772: @mr_vidar_viking phil streamed on YT for years. yes you do know
[2017-01-18 22:22:16 UTC] bonvoyagee3: i can tell you that BKH is great for DS1
[2017-01-18 22:22:17 UTC] dukesdearfreja: Why'd you time me out?
[2017-01-18 22:22:20 UTC] nerv117: i dont even remember the weapons in dark souls 2
[2017-01-18 22:22:26 UTC] nerv117: i need to do another run
[2017-01-18 22:22:29 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Dick lightning obviously
[2017-01-18 22:22:30 UTC] sickvenom215: yea people shouldn't be getting banned or timed out just for disagree or having a different opinion about the game play. Especially if they are regulars
[2017-01-18 22:22:33 UTC] khawaja7: cause you are a spider Kappa
[2017-01-18 22:22:36 UTC] slashingtomcat: @Lokizarro not really if someone were to search him up on youtube it would be detractor videos Which would make people thin this guy is bad then they'll tell there friends and so on
[2017-01-18 22:22:39 UTC] tulliuscicero25: i liked that chime hammer
[2017-01-18 22:22:46 UTC] tulliuscicero25: that was a cool one
[2017-01-18 22:22:46 UTC] sickvenom215: Mods should only ban if it's something malicious
[2017-01-18 22:22:54 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Sickvenom215, but people are getting timed out for posting StinkyCheese
[2017-01-18 22:23:03 UTC] maaduno: your own opinion in 2017? not while vidar is watching :P
[2017-01-18 22:23:06 UTC] kg1772: @Sickvenom215 i said cheese souls. thats a timeout offense apparently.
[2017-01-18 22:23:06 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: afeter phil beat a boss fair and square
[2017-01-18 22:23:11 UTC] khoroshiy: StinkyCheese
[2017-01-18 22:23:21 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: stinky cheese is not what that was
[2017-01-18 22:23:25 UTC] khoroshiy: lmaoooo
[2017-01-18 22:23:25 UTC] auxitius: stinkycheese
[2017-01-18 22:23:27 UTC] bonvoyagee3: you get sent to the gulag in this chat much easier than in the USSR
[2017-01-18 22:23:29 UTC] auxitius: woow
[2017-01-18 22:23:29 UTC] lokizarro: @Slashingtomcat, I think the amount of people that actually *hate* Phil is small, some people just like to mess with him a little and jest at his expense sometimes.
[2017-01-18 22:23:30 UTC] dxfreedom: lol
[2017-01-18 22:23:38 UTC] vicwraith: It's just an emote, I don't see why that's something to get banned for.
[2017-01-18 22:23:41 UTC] kg1772: @mr_vidar_viking so your own personal opinions effect who you time out.
[2017-01-18 22:23:42 UTC] slurmdrinker: dspSexy
[2017-01-18 22:23:45 UTC] lokizarro: Like, swatting someone is fucked up, even general detractors were annoyed about that.
[2017-01-18 22:23:49 UTC] tulliuscicero25: agreed lokizarro
[2017-01-18 22:23:50 UTC] alexaponteftw: Bkh and havels is StinkyCheese lets be honest
[2017-01-18 22:24:01 UTC] nerv117: i remember i used that fire longsword in dark souls 2
[2017-01-18 22:24:05 UTC] auxitius: StinkyCheese
[2017-01-18 22:24:06 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @nerv117 That's what I've been doing. I started a brand new deprived run w/ no gift and have been chugging along in DS1. Got everything in the game and am close to NG+6. Not sure if I want to bother w/ the covenants, but I plan on doing the same for DS2 SotFS and then DS3, which I need to play again.
[2017-01-18 22:24:12 UTC] tulliuscicero25: i think people just laugh at his expense a lot
[2017-01-18 22:24:12 UTC] slashingtomcat: @mr_vidar_viking the build is fairly cheesy
[2017-01-18 22:24:14 UTC] gaylordbutthump: tank builds in general are StinkyCheese
[2017-01-18 22:24:21 UTC] dukesdearfreja: @mr_vidar_viking Why'd you time me out?
[2017-01-18 22:24:24 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: people that just spam hate deserve a time out
[2017-01-18 22:24:27 UTC] sickvenom215: Yea no one should be banned or timed out for saying cheese. That's just funny
[2017-01-18 22:24:35 UTC] dxfreedom: everything exept a sl1 naked run is cheese
[2017-01-18 22:24:36 UTC] lokizarro: It's in good fun until it goes too far, which sadly some people do take it too far.
[2017-01-18 22:24:39 UTC] rbreezay: !uptime
[2017-01-18 22:24:43 UTC] auxitius: you have a different definition of hate
[2017-01-18 22:24:53 UTC] lokizarro: Hate is a pretty strong word.
[2017-01-18 22:24:56 UTC] is_nation: what about people that tell people to F off?
[2017-01-18 22:24:58 UTC] str33m: emotes = hate PogChamp
[2017-01-18 22:24:58 UTC] sickvenom215: Maybe they are not into the gameplay but are into the chat. They are just having fun. Nothing malicious about that.
[2017-01-18 22:25:01 UTC] is_nation: Do they deserve a time out?
[2017-01-18 22:25:03 UTC] ukyo9: That feeling when Onliafro ends up joining the stream only now that all is over
[2017-01-18 22:25:03 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Cheesing is legit, but still cheese just like starcraft2 6 banelings ur ass
[2017-01-18 22:25:07 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: maybe I think i have taken a bit of unwarranted shit today
[2017-01-18 22:25:07 UTC] kg1772: cheese souls is "hate"? Your personal opinions should not be a factor in timing someone out. if i think its cheese, and you think its not. who cares
[2017-01-18 22:25:09 UTC] auxitius: vidar was telling people to f off earlier
[2017-01-18 22:25:10 UTC] rbreezay: Phil probably taking a #2 and reading kalameet FAQs
[2017-01-18 22:25:12 UTC] beanie5181: Lords of the fallen redemption run is next right?
[2017-01-18 22:25:23 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: but you can comfort yourself when you are assholes that it's my birthday
[2017-01-18 22:25:26 UTC] is_nation: well when you act the way you do, you only incite more of it
[2017-01-18 22:25:31 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: so i really deserve it to daty
[2017-01-18 22:25:31 UTC] lokizarro: Lords of Fallen needs to redeem ITSELF from what I've seen lmao
[2017-01-18 22:25:35 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: I want a Demon's Souls redemption
[2017-01-18 22:25:35 UTC] taurusoxford: @Beanie5181 there's nothing redeeming about Lords of the Fallen
[2017-01-18 22:25:38 UTC] kuroriku: lol
[2017-01-18 22:25:40 UTC] slashingtomcat: a lot of people come here to watch him rage and they're not getting any of it
[2017-01-18 22:25:42 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: Phil cheesed the ending with Allant
[2017-01-18 22:25:45 UTC] dxfreedom: happy b day mr_vidar_viking

[2017-01-18 22:25:57 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Lol, Lords of the Fallen...I quit that game so fast.
[2017-01-18 22:25:58 UTC] beanie5181: Lords of the fallen > dark souls
[2017-01-18 22:26:01 UTC] kg1772: @the_one_and_only_baron he also used the item duplicate glitch. was open about it tho after the PT
[2017-01-18 22:26:02 UTC] bobbi_ling: happy birthday dear viking
[2017-01-18 22:26:11 UTC] tulliuscicero25: watched someone else play that

[2017-01-18 22:26:43 UTC] tulliuscicero25: why you modding on your birthday vidar?
[2017-01-18 22:26:46 UTC] lokizarro: Happy B day to you, happy b day to you, happy b day to you, happy b day to you.
[2017-01-18 22:26:46 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: thanks bethe
[2017-01-18 22:26:46 UTC] mimmick404: Phill you used to be a pioneer for the souls genre and you were a very important person for the community but it has all clearly changed. i'm very sorry this happened but i cant keep watching you do this to yourself. goodbye.
[2017-01-18 22:26:51 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: @kg1772 Honestly, if Phil actually leveled up his intelligence and weapons in that run, his souls rays and spells would've done enough damage. But he missed the fundamentals on that one
[2017-01-18 22:27:01 UTC] tulliuscicero25: go do something fun for yourself!
[2017-01-18 22:27:13 UTC] batmanbbcp: wtf i go get smokes and hes on break come on phil lo?
[2017-01-18 22:27:15 UTC] lokizarro: @mimmick404 you lost me at the first line dood.

[2017-01-18 22:27:19 UTC] bethe2670: /me closes guide for good
[2017-01-18 22:27:20 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I am feeling a little under the weather, only had a few friends over for dinner they went home early
[2017-01-18 22:27:22 UTC] kg1772: @the_one_and_only_baron he glitched and went to level 96 after beating the first two bosses. Was kinda turned off by that
[2017-01-18 22:27:22 UTC] gaylordbutthump: also if he hadn't used dark silver shield while casting spells LUL
[2017-01-18 22:27:30 UTC] theycallmejimbob: finally bethe2670
[2017-01-18 22:27:33 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :P

[2017-01-18 22:27:59 UTC] dxfreedom: rumor has it Vaatividya went to phil for his lore videos
[2017-01-18 22:28:10 UTC] babbyrage: lmfao
[2017-01-18 22:28:11 UTC] yacherdy: lawl OOT is dead
[2017-01-18 22:28:14 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: @kg1772 Which is why there should be a redemption. I think if he upgrades his weapons he'll be good
[2017-01-18 22:28:17 UTC] shekelbergosteinwitz: I wish Phil would go back to BB and kill Ludwig :(
[2017-01-18 22:28:18 UTC] kuroriku: @mr_vidar_viking now we gotta be friends 😆
[2017-01-18 22:28:21 UTC] lokizarro: I'm picturing Phil at the front if a ship as a captain with his chin perked up, guiding it towards Lordran, a true pioneer indeed!
[2017-01-18 22:28:32 UTC] bethe2670: yacherdy he will play it tomorrow cause this will be done
[2017-01-18 22:28:38 UTC] kg1772: @the_one_and_only_baron yea jumping to SL 96 after two boses the rest was cake for him lol
[2017-01-18 22:28:38 UTC] tulliuscicero25: telescope in hand
[2017-01-18 22:28:39 UTC] batmanbbcp: why did phil go back to twitch any ways

[2017-01-18 22:29:08 UTC] yacherdy: @bethe2670 I'm sure most of his fanbase are waiting for RE7
[2017-01-18 22:29:10 UTC] lokizarro: Phil is a glitch pioneer, he manages to find things I didn't even know exist so in that regard you're kinda right lol
[2017-01-18 22:29:11 UTC] gineriella: PHIL
[2017-01-18 22:29:14 UTC] nerv117: cause twitch is cool and we have dspSexy
[2017-01-18 22:29:27 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: I think Phil has done more for Dark Souls, than most of the community. He raised awareness of the games, and made one of the best "live" runs ever.
[2017-01-18 22:29:28 UTC] bethe2670: gines he is on break now but he should be back soon
[2017-01-18 22:29:32 UTC] bethe2670: its been a while
[2017-01-18 22:29:32 UTC] beanie5181: Yes lords of the fallen has a steep learning curve but it has such a bad ass art and character style and feels smoother than dark souls SeemsGood
[2017-01-18 22:29:36 UTC] gineriella: lol booo
[2017-01-18 22:29:39 UTC] gineriella: then i'ma make dinner

[2017-01-18 22:29:48 UTC] bethe2670: then we see him fight KALAMEET
[2017-01-18 22:29:49 UTC] is_nation: it's also janker than dark souls
[2017-01-18 22:29:51 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Wut? Lol

[2017-01-18 22:30:04 UTC] gineriella: lol it kinda was
[2017-01-18 22:30:05 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bethe2670, is he close to that boss fight or does he have to some exploring
[2017-01-18 22:30:10 UTC] gineriella: like i'm being chased by that guy with the huge scissors
[2017-01-18 22:30:12 UTC] moofhs: dsp invented dark souls
[2017-01-18 22:30:14 UTC] yacherdy: Has Phil one shot all these DLC bosses so far?
[2017-01-18 22:30:20 UTC] gineriella: and he would just stand in the room instead of going out patrolling
[2017-01-18 22:30:26 UTC] gineriella: i channeled Phi lol
[2017-01-18 22:30:34 UTC] iconicmaster1: Where Phil at
[2017-01-18 22:30:37 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: I think Phil is getting irritated by the fact that views per video decline in a long playlist
[2017-01-18 22:30:38 UTC] theycallmejimbob: did you do a controller slam gineriella ?
[2017-01-18 22:30:41 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob its next to the artorias arena

[2017-01-18 23:16:45 UTC] naddodr: I always completely forget about Re7 then remember it, get excited and forget again
[2017-01-18 23:17:18 UTC] alex_dragonul: Great PT man but i have to say Gwyen was disappointing a little , the final boss is DS3 is much better imo
[2017-01-18 23:17:32 UTC] jaykirkbride: its best to forget about it , time goes by quicker :P
[2017-01-18 23:17:36 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: poise is too good in this game
[2017-01-18 23:17:36 UTC] prestonsmomisawh0re: gwen could have been great but ya know, dsp
[2017-01-18 23:17:42 UTC] naddodr: Apparently Twitch thinks I'm German lol
[2017-01-18 23:17:44 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: I'm glad 2 and 3 punish facetanking
[2017-01-18 23:18:09 UTC] darksydephil: final boss in DS3 is far better than Gwyn
[2017-01-18 23:18:20 UTC] str33m: PogChamp
[2017-01-18 23:18:22 UTC] darksydephil: way more attack patterns and multiple phases. bosses in DS1 dont even have phases lol
[2017-01-18 23:18:28 UTC] flandersstwitch: did he complete the game? Kappa
[2017-01-18 23:18:33 UTC] darksydegeoff: one of my favorite dsp series is street fighter and project 7
[2017-01-18 23:18:35 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: Phil! where art thou???
[2017-01-18 23:18:37 UTC] is_nation: almost like Soul of Cinder was meant to be a Gwyn 2.0 lol
[2017-01-18 23:18:37 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: Gwyn is a burned up shadow of his former self
[2017-01-18 23:18:45 UTC] prestonsmomisawh0re: remember phil the local burger king is always hiring. You might even get a raise for all of your dsp tries it videos
[2017-01-18 23:18:51 UTC] elipsion: Hey Phil any possibility to get a Lost Odyssey for patreon playthrough
[2017-01-18 23:18:53 UTC] theycallmefis: @DarksydePhil will you do a Bloodborne DLC redemption run?
[2017-01-18 23:18:54 UTC] donniedarksouls: Some do but you're so op you tore rhrough
[2017-01-18 23:19:02 UTC] str33m: @DarksydePhil, where did you get your dashboard picture?
[2017-01-18 23:19:12 UTC] retrocerberus: Jak 3 for patreon as well
[2017-01-18 23:19:12 UTC] gorillabaz: Did I miss it again?
[2017-01-18 23:19:15 UTC] darksydephil: id love to do lost odyssey during a dead time of year, like summertime
[2017-01-18 23:19:22 UTC] darksydephil: cant do it now though, far too many new releases coming up shortly
[2017-01-18 23:19:30 UTC] flandersstwitch: has he finished the game?
[2017-01-18 23:19:32 UTC] donniedarksouls: Guarantee you face him the way most people do on an average character and artorias would tear you a new one
[2017-01-18 23:19:40 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: @DarksydePhil Would you do another Souls game like Demon's Souls if you had the chance?
[2017-01-18 23:19:40 UTC] reversehollow: I think you'd walk easily thru Bloodbornes dlc now Phil
[2017-01-18 23:19:47 UTC] darksydephil: i already did face artorious, and he did beat my ass
[2017-01-18 23:19:51 UTC] darksydephil: i remember lol
[2017-01-18 23:19:56 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: haha
[2017-01-18 23:20:03 UTC] naddodr: spanked dat ass
[2017-01-18 23:20:05 UTC] donniedarksouls: I suppose thats true
[2017-01-18 23:20:05 UTC] darksydephil: yes, i woudln't be against another demons souls run. i really liked that game
[2017-01-18 23:20:14 UTC] naddodr: oooh YES!!
[2017-01-18 23:20:21 UTC] flandersstwitch: @DarksydePhil, old hunters or riot
[2017-01-18 23:20:30 UTC] darksydephil: i wouldn't even have to rebuy that one as i have the license for it already
[2017-01-18 23:20:42 UTC] naddodr: I mean..uhh yes, please
[2017-01-18 23:20:47 UTC] darksydephil: ive explained 100 times why i can't do the bloodborne dlc, to keep asking for it is a sign of mass stupidity
[2017-01-18 23:20:50 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @DarksydePhil, What about Scholar of the first sin DS2 w/o dick lightning? Kappa
[2017-01-18 23:20:53 UTC] darksydephil: so please keep asking kappa
[2017-01-18 23:20:55 UTC] darksydephil: oops
[2017-01-18 23:20:56 UTC] darksydephil: Kappa
[2017-01-18 23:21:04 UTC] donniedarksouls: So @darksydephil did you actually level to 97 or did you dupe?
[2017-01-18 23:21:13 UTC] darksydephil: this was a legit run
[2017-01-18 23:21:15 UTC] darksydephil: i dont know how to dupe
[2017-01-18 23:21:21 UTC] darksydephil: i never did
[2017-01-18 23:21:21 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: this was very legit actually
[2017-01-18 23:21:23 UTC] elipsion: Dark Cloud is another good game that would likely make for a good run
[2017-01-18 23:21:25 UTC] flandersstwitch: so is that a yes to the old hunters or a no
[2017-01-18 23:21:27 UTC] elipsion: RPG with building elements
[2017-01-18 23:21:31 UTC] alex_dragonul: @DarksydePhil Yep bc it had phases and too see using skills from all classes was very cool , i kinda find DS3 almost equel to DS1
[2017-01-18 23:21:33 UTC] shotinthedeep: Yeah, unless you wanted to play all of bloodborne over
[2017-01-18 23:21:33 UTC] darksydephil: people accused me of cheating in demons souls too when i dont know how to do it lol
[2017-01-18 23:21:37 UTC] slashingtomcat: @DarksydePhil if you're doing demon souls don't use magic this time
[2017-01-18 23:21:47 UTC] donniedarksouls: @darksydephil i meant demons souls not dark souls
[2017-01-18 23:21:50 UTC] darksydephil: oh
[2017-01-18 23:22:04 UTC] darksydephil: yeah, again, i dont know about any duping glitch. didnt know it exsited until people accused me of it
[2017-01-18 23:22:09 UTC] darksydephil: i just grinded a TON off camera
[2017-01-18 23:22:10 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: when where you not allowed to use the best items for your build in a run, and why the hell would that make it illegitimate
[2017-01-18 23:22:18 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: just teh stupidest most provoking shit i have heard
[2017-01-18 23:22:23 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: Phil you are not supposed to be good at DS. What is this sorcery?
[2017-01-18 23:22:33 UTC] flandersstwitch: you got level 90 by killing skeletons
[2017-01-18 23:22:38 UTC] darksydephil: im not good, i just know the system and use it to win
[2017-01-18 23:22:41 UTC] the_one_and_only_baron: Phil, if you do a Souls game again,you should try running a Vitality Gauge, I think it matches with your playstyle the most
[2017-01-18 23:22:42 UTC] darksydephil: i didnt the first time i played these games
[2017-01-18 23:22:46 UTC] gorillabaz: Hey mr viking do you have console to play dark souls on?
[2017-01-18 23:22:50 UTC] naddodr: Armoured Spider says hello Phil
[2017-01-18 23:22:51 UTC] donniedarksouls: Just saying calling me people stupid is no way to argue @mr_vidar_viking
[2017-01-18 23:22:58 UTC] slashingtomcat: my problem was that he was only able to use the build if chat didn't mention havel
[2017-01-18 23:23:02 UTC] donniedarksouls: Calling people*
[2017-01-18 23:23:03 UTC] theycallmefis: @DarksydePhil you ganna be playing Mass effect Andromeda
[2017-01-18 23:23:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: your people?
[2017-01-18 23:23:21 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: Phil is humble :)

[2017-01-18 23:23:36 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: very well phil
[2017-01-18 23:23:40 UTC] darksydephil: and cool thing is, since i finished early, maybe i can start the dark souls montages and stuff sooner rather than later
[2017-01-18 23:23:42 UTC] darksydephil: we'll see!
[2017-01-18 23:23:45 UTC] socothunder: damn missed it live WutFace

[2017-01-18 23:24:24 UTC] konagrylls: vidar succs bad mod
[2017-01-18 23:24:40 UTC] donniedarksouls: @darksydephil so why exactly cant you do bloodborne? i havnt heard or scene you mention it since the ludwig fiaso.
[2017-01-18 23:24:42 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah thanks dude
[2017-01-18 23:24:52 UTC] darksydephil: i have no game save file
[2017-01-18 23:25:01 UTC] gorillabaz: Hey Viking do you have dark souls?
[2017-01-18 23:25:06 UTC] alex_dragonul: @DarksydePhil but DS1 dose seems to have more optional paths and i like how you get too see a preview of some bosses
[2017-01-18 23:25:08 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: best cherr evahh haha nice one
[2017-01-18 23:25:10 UTC] donniedarksouls: Ah ok
[2017-01-18 23:25:16 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: ofcourse
[2017-01-18 23:25:20 UTC] slashingtomcat: his best souls runs were either his first/second dark souls run or his demon souls
[2017-01-18 23:25:24 UTC] lightweightbro: oh man DSP beat it already?
[2017-01-18 23:25:26 UTC] darksydephil: i had no room on the ps4 last yea rand had to delete everything, and it never uploaded to teh cloud because the WWE games for 2014 and 2015 had a bug where they uploaded DOZENS of gigs to the cloud and took up all the save space
[2017-01-18 23:25:42 UTC] lightweightbro: poops
[2017-01-18 23:25:55 UTC] gorillabaz: And do you not enjoy playing it yourself
[2017-01-18 23:25:56 UTC] darksydephil: so theres no way i can ever go back to teh bloodborne dlc without replayign the entire game from the start, which im not doing
[2017-01-18 23:26:07 UTC] alex_dragonul: I really liked his DS3 run a lot
[2017-01-18 23:26:07 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: oh I see
[2017-01-18 23:26:09 UTC] isalore: cant you do a speedrush to the dlc, shouldnt take long?
[2017-01-18 23:26:13 UTC] lightweightbro: Phil would you consider it right before BB2 comes out?
[2017-01-18 23:26:14 UTC] elipsion: damn that sucks
[2017-01-18 23:26:28 UTC] lightweightbro: assuming there's no other hot releases
[2017-01-18 23:26:36 UTC] donniedarksouls: @darksydephil you can get to the dlc at dlc standard in <4hrs or something, might still be worth it? That ones pure gold if you do do it
[2017-01-18 23:26:59 UTC] slashingtomcat: I want to see an old monk remath
[2017-01-18 23:27:04 UTC] slashingtomcat: rematch*
[2017-01-18 23:27:34 UTC] darksydephil: it would take at least two MAJOR sreams to get back to the DLC and i'd have shit equipment. its not worth it, plus i dont own the game anymore
[2017-01-18 23:27:52 UTC] lightweightbro: :(
[2017-01-18 23:27:55 UTC] darksydephil: lets face it, nobody is gonna watch me replay 6+ hours of bloodborne when i already did a legit run
[2017-01-18 23:28:01 UTC] darksydephil: its not like Dark Souls at all, totally different situation
[2017-01-18 23:28:22 UTC] slashingtomcat: i would
[2017-01-18 23:28:34 UTC] gorillabaz: Don't get me wrong Mr Viking watching Phil play is enjoyable but why would you pay someone to watch him playing a game when you have it yourself?
[2017-01-18 23:28:44 UTC] alex_dragonul: I would watch def Phil
[2017-01-18 23:28:51 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: why are you here asking the question?
[2017-01-18 23:28:54 UTC] darksydephil: gorillabaz, that's the basis of ALL OF TWITCH
[2017-01-18 23:28:55 UTC] darksydephil: lololol
[2017-01-18 23:29:00 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: it's that a bit ronic in and of it self?
[2017-01-18 23:29:07 UTC] darksydephil: like, you have a cool million people to ask that question if you have issue with it
[2017-01-18 23:29:25 UTC] darksydephil: so why dont you head off and find out for yourself
[2017-01-18 23:29:28 UTC] gorillabaz: I thought it was about subs and that though
[2017-01-18 23:29:36 UTC] slashingtomcat: I think he means donations
[2017-01-18 23:29:37 UTC] darksydephil: subs are paid
[2017-01-18 23:29:39 UTC] darksydegeoff: yeah lol the culture of twitch is to enjoy someone else's experience
[2017-01-18 23:29:41 UTC] darksydephil: bits are paid
[2017-01-18 23:29:46 UTC] darksydephil: donations are paid
[2017-01-18 23:29:53 UTC] darksydephil: enjoy someone else gaming, toss them a few bucks
[2017-01-18 23:29:55 UTC] darksydegeoff: the chat room is like a stadium cheering/jeering
[2017-01-18 23:29:59 UTC] darksydephil: thats the entire premise of twitch
[2017-01-18 23:30:16 UTC] lightweightbro: Phil what are you having for dinner tonight?
[2017-01-18 23:30:23 UTC] donniedarksouls: @darksydephil i totally disagree, whether you like it or not people like seeing you fuck up, a bloodborne replay would be highly fruitful
[2017-01-18 23:30:25 UTC] darksydegeoff: it's the same thing as watching someone play a sport
[2017-01-18 23:30:34 UTC] gorillabaz: I get that the subs thing
[2017-01-18 23:30:40 UTC] donniedarksouls: Probably draw around 600-700 people on stream
[2017-01-18 23:30:46 UTC] donniedarksouls: Same as souls
[2017-01-18 23:30:50 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: Phil actually needs the support, while other streamers shit money and they stil get money thrown at them
[2017-01-18 23:31:13 UTC] slashingtomcat: bahroo made 1000 in an hour yesterday
[2017-01-18 23:31:15 UTC] darksydephil: donnie, the problem isn't the stream
[2017-01-18 23:31:23 UTC] darksydephil: stream viewership doens't equate to money to pay my bills
[2017-01-18 23:31:30 UTC] gorillabaz: I get the point of subbing but call me old fashion I play games myself to enjoy and fuck that cost 60 dollars a pop as it
[2017-01-18 23:31:36 UTC] darksydephil: i either need subs, cheers or youtube views. and 6+ hours of replaying the beginning of bloodborne wont do that
[2017-01-18 23:31:46 UTC] gorillabaz: Why pay good coin to watch someone else doing it
[2017-01-18 23:31:49 UTC] darksydephil: hell, you may not realize this, but when that dlc was new and i played it, it didn't get much viewership. nobody really cared
[2017-01-18 23:32:20 UTC] gorillabaz: Maybe it just me
[2017-01-18 23:32:24 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: why support something you like in general
[2017-01-18 23:32:27 UTC] darksydegeoff: yeah @gorillabaz but as you can tell there's a whole culture behind twitch so even if you don't get it (i don't get it as much either) there's still a ton of other people who do
[2017-01-18 23:32:33 UTC] darksydephil: i dont see the time investment to get back to playing a dlc nobody cared about to begin with lol
[2017-01-18 23:32:46 UTC] walkingmycat: phil you planning to cover breath of the wild?
[2017-01-18 23:32:48 UTC] emnay_i_say: I cared. BibleThump
[2017-01-18 23:32:48 UTC] darksydegeoff: i like watching streams when i'm at work :)
[2017-01-18 23:33:13 UTC] gorillabaz: Maybe I'm a secret Jew or something LOL
[2017-01-18 23:33:29 UTC] darksydegeoff: not sure what that has to do with that but maybe
[2017-01-18 23:33:34 UTC] popstradamus: @eMnAy_I_sAy, A lot of people did and do
[2017-01-18 23:33:35 UTC] darksydephil: yup ill be playing breath of the wild for sure
[2017-01-18 23:33:35 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: who knows
[2017-01-18 23:33:37 UTC] lightweightbro: phil do you think it was a better decision to play DS rather than RDR? Would you still replay RDR at some point?
[2017-01-18 23:33:47 UTC] isalore: phil please do re1 remaster hard playthrough :)
[2017-01-18 23:33:50 UTC] lightweightbro: before RDR2 comes out maybe
[2017-01-18 23:34:01 UTC] darksydephil: yes i think this did far better than a replay of RDR honestly, and i actually feel like i accomplished somethign out of it as well
[2017-01-18 23:34:03 UTC] donniedarksouls: Seriously? @darksydephil thats pretty god damned surprising, regardless i think a good strategy for you would be to identify some tough games to play periodically, people (detractors and fans) love that shit
[2017-01-18 23:34:06 UTC] gorillabaz: Have you guys heard of a game called Ark Survival Evolved?
[2017-01-18 23:34:19 UTC] darksydephil: yup donniedarksouls makes sense
[2017-01-18 23:34:33 UTC] darksydegeoff: hi @DarksydePhil i'm sorry for the years of grief and i'm glad you helped me through my college years so i can do my dream working in the game industry, no troll
[2017-01-18 23:34:41 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: i have some open word futuristic jurrasic park shit
[2017-01-18 23:34:51 UTC] slashingtomcat: @DarksydePhil if you want to bring in detractors and fans than play MGS3
[2017-01-18 23:35:20 UTC] darksydegeoff: it was cool watching phil play through some of the games i worked on
[2017-01-18 23:35:21 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @DarksydePhil, A redemption run of Metal Gear Solid would be very beneficial for you actually.
[2017-01-18 23:35:23 UTC] gorillabaz: Yeah viking it dinosaurs and shit but its multiplayer online but you can set up private servers to stop griefing
[2017-01-18 23:35:35 UTC] donniedarksouls: @darksydephil you did alright, i still dont rate you as a ds player and you got lucky with bkh but for the most part i think it was legit and you on you're own
[2017-01-18 23:35:36 UTC] bluejoey1800: Is DSP gonna play the new Nioh demo? It was just announced today and playable during the weekend
[2017-01-18 23:35:42 UTC] lightweightbro: he beat MGS legit though...
[2017-01-18 23:35:42 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: it's very sandbox as i understand also
[2017-01-18 23:35:44 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: Did Phil ever play Ride to Hell?
[2017-01-18 23:35:48 UTC] isalore: darksydegeoff, what kind of work do you do? 3d? 2d?
[2017-01-18 23:35:54 UTC] isalore: programming?
[2017-01-18 23:35:57 UTC] darksydephil: lol Geoff, to be honest, i largely ignore people who troll me. you may have noticed i never directly responded to stuff you said or did, purposely
[2017-01-18 23:36:00 UTC] emnay_i_say: The demo would bring in a good amount of views.
[2017-01-18 23:36:03 UTC] gorillabaz: The Nier demo is playablenow as far as I know
[2017-01-18 23:36:13 UTC] darksydegeoff: @Isalore i'm credited with batman arkham knight, scribblenauts remix and killer instinct
[2017-01-18 23:36:14 UTC] darksydephil: its just that theres SO MANY PEOPLE who troll me, that when i do finally address 1-2, people think its like a normal thing that i do
[2017-01-18 23:36:15 UTC] bluejoey1800: Gorilla- Not Nier, Nioh
[2017-01-18 23:36:20 UTC] alex_dragonul: Ride to hell retribution ? no he didn't
[2017-01-18 23:36:34 UTC] darksydegeoff: @DarksydePhil I think you noticed but I've definitely like calmed down for the past like 5 years or so lol
[2017-01-18 23:36:36 UTC] slashingtomcat: he may have beaten it legit but it's the run that spawned the *** videos
[2017-01-18 23:36:37 UTC] gorillabaz: Yeah sorry I meant Noih
[2017-01-18 23:36:43 UTC] darksydegeoff: But thank you @DarksydePhil for the acknowledgement
[2017-01-18 23:36:47 UTC] donniedarksouls: Ride to hell fuckin sucks
[2017-01-18 23:36:48 UTC] gorillabaz: thedark souls type game
[2017-01-18 23:37:03 UTC] bluejoey1800: Ah, then no, not playable. you can preload the demo but it unlocks during the weekend
[2017-01-18 23:37:08 UTC] mrmarlboroz: I would
[2017-01-18 23:37:09 UTC] donniedarksouls: Id enjoy a playthrough but dont think its a crowd drawer
[2017-01-18 23:37:17 UTC] gorillabaz: Ah ok got that wrong then
[2017-01-18 23:37:17 UTC] lightweightbro: are you thanking him for acknowledging your trolling? huh?
[2017-01-18 23:37:42 UTC] darksydegeoff: thanking him for acknowledging my apology
[2017-01-18 23:37:43 UTC] alex_dragonul: lol i think thast way people want to see , it will be like Sonic 2006 prob , some funny ass shit will come from that i assume
[2017-01-18 23:37:47 UTC] lightweightbro: o
[2017-01-18 23:38:02 UTC] slashingtomcat: demon souls was the best. I remember when he rage against Old Monk
[2017-01-18 23:38:03 UTC] darksydephil: i dont take any offense honestly, unless someone does something to concretely hurt me for real
[2017-01-18 23:38:14 UTC] darksydephil: nothing tha tyou did DarksydeGeoff every really HURT me, it was just silly stuff
[2017-01-18 23:38:19 UTC] darksydephil: the shit these kids do now is just insane
[2017-01-18 23:38:22 UTC] darksydegeoff: yeah dude trust me i was one of the first to speak up when some fucking idiot swatted you @DarksydePhil
[2017-01-18 23:38:28 UTC] lightweightbro: unless it was you that called in the fucking SWAT team
[2017-01-18 23:38:29 UTC] darksydephil: i almost can't do this as a job anymore because of the shit they did to my business
[2017-01-18 23:38:31 UTC] lightweightbro: what a bunch of shit
[2017-01-18 23:38:36 UTC] darksydegeoff: dude there are people on CHRISTMAS DAY trying to fuck with your life
[2017-01-18 23:38:44 UTC] bluejoey1800: I'm glad Koei Tecmo is releasing the PSX Nioh demo for everyone. Been impatiently waiting for Nioh. 19 more daaays
[2017-01-18 23:39:16 UTC] slashingtomcat: @DarksydePhil you no longer appear on the first page of youtube videos
[2017-01-18 23:39:17 UTC] gorillabaz: How about DarksydeGeoff challanges DSP to a set of SF5?
[2017-01-18 23:39:17 UTC] donniedarksouls: Theres no doubt that when you put you're self online you make your self availabe to some of the most toxic people in out society
[2017-01-18 23:39:27 UTC] donniedarksouls: But some people just enjoy fucking with a people a bit and they arent necessarily bad either
[2017-01-18 23:39:32 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I say this every time; it's perfectly fine to not Lik Phil or his content, it's absolutely not okay to interfere w/ his life. That's what obsessive stalkers do.
[2017-01-18 23:39:36 UTC] darksydegeoff: pshhhh DSP would probably beat me, I hate SFV
[2017-01-18 23:39:42 UTC] darksydephil: i barely ever show up on ANY pages of youtube search videos
[2017-01-18 23:39:50 UTC] darksydephil: thats why i lost over 40% of my business in the last 2 years
[2017-01-18 23:39:54 UTC] gorillabaz: Ok then Killer Instinct then
[2017-01-18 23:39:55 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Wit does this got to do with bloodborne? Bloodborne should attract just as much if not more interest like ds1
[2017-01-18 23:40:23 UTC] darksydegeoff: i don't think a developer vs someone who doesn't play the game would be fair lol
[2017-01-18 23:40:31 UTC] isalore: when I search on DSP that *** burnell channel always pops up even before the original dsp channel
[2017-01-18 23:40:52 UTC] slashingtomcat: there's a lot of *** and lets teach Phil how to play videos though
[2017-01-18 23:40:53 UTC] gorillabaz: So what would be fair then Geoff?
[2017-01-18 23:40:58 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah phil can't you do anything about those who just blatantlly mirrors your videos?
[2017-01-18 23:41:07 UTC] slashingtomcat: nope
[2017-01-18 23:41:13 UTC] slashingtomcat: it's all fair use
[2017-01-18 23:41:19 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: it's not at all
[2017-01-18 23:41:24 UTC] darksydegeoff: probably nothing to be fair, i doubt he'll wanna play since he's probably suspicious i'd use his name for views or something and i'm totally okay with that
[2017-01-18 23:41:32 UTC] slashingtomcat: technically it is
[2017-01-18 23:41:44 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: fair use means the matrial has another meaning then the original
[2017-01-18 23:41:45 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: Its like that line in batman: some people just want to watch the world burn
[2017-01-18 23:41:46 UTC] gorillabaz: Fair use is a prickly subject
[2017-01-18 23:41:48 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: a mirror is exactly the same
[2017-01-18 23:41:56 UTC] sccrkd101: It's not because of the shitty personality you seem to portray to the entire community? How the focus of blame is everything but yourself?
[2017-01-18 23:42:07 UTC] bluejoey1800: Whenever I search DSP on youtube, some indian guy pops up a lot
[2017-01-18 23:42:14 UTC] gorillabaz: Some could say its for review, satire or fuck knows what
[2017-01-18 23:42:37 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: he isn't trolling himself scckd101
[2017-01-18 23:42:59 UTC] slashingtomcat: most of these videos are edited and Phils videos are entertainment a lot of these videos fall under criticism or parody
[2017-01-18 23:43:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: not mirrorws
[2017-01-18 23:43:15 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Dsp is also a name for some indian music company or wutever it is
[2017-01-18 23:43:17 UTC] donniedarksouls: Itd be entertaing to see him take on super mario kaizou
[2017-01-18 23:43:26 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: Sccrkd101 he is just some guy playing video games, if enjay you watch if you dont go watch someone else
[2017-01-18 23:43:29 UTC] darksydephil: none of it is fair use, at all, per my legal counsel. but youtube requires a lawsuit PER VIDEO to take anything down permanently
[2017-01-18 23:43:29 UTC] donniedarksouls: That games nuts
[2017-01-18 23:43:33 UTC] darksydephil: and i dont hve the money or time to do that
[2017-01-18 23:43:49 UTC] mrsirlogan: Lmao
[2017-01-18 23:43:50 UTC] darksydephil: everyone who puts up a video and i take it down, and they dispute it? they've broken the law and i could sue the shit out of them if i had the money and time
[2017-01-18 23:44:01 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: but exact mirrors of your content should be slam dunk shouldnt it
[2017-01-18 23:44:10 UTC] darksydephil: nope, because youtube's system is shit
[2017-01-18 23:44:18 UTC] darksydephil: even people who upload exact copies can just dispute your claim
[2017-01-18 23:44:22 UTC] mrmarlboroz: This is old stuffs that were alrdy talked about, why are we talking about it?
[2017-01-18 23:44:24 UTC] darksydephil: and without a lawsuit, it goes right back up
[2017-01-18 23:44:29 UTC] mrsirlogan: Oink oink oink you little fat pig
[2017-01-18 23:44:31 UTC] gorillabaz: Is the problem not that there could be millions of things on You Tube that could be questionably copyright infringing
[2017-01-18 23:44:38 UTC] darksydegeoff: yeah no youtube's system is fucking awful, they shoot first then ask later
[2017-01-18 23:44:40 UTC] mrsirlogan: Eat more cmon
[2017-01-18 23:44:42 UTC] donniedarksouls: @darksydephil in the earlier days you just disputed it and you were fine, are things different now?
[2017-01-18 23:44:43 UTC] mrsirlogan: Do it
[2017-01-18 23:44:53 UTC] rickymt: Nigga, you dont work, what exactly you have bu ttime?
[2017-01-18 23:45:12 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: well that doesn't make any sense at all. So in theory anyone can mirror and monetize anything already on youtube?
[2017-01-18 23:45:12 UTC] slashingtomcat: not always though "All gameplay is taken from the channel "DSPGaming", used for parody and informative purposes. This is a "transformative work" which counts as Fair Use." that's the description of one video. He just changed the context of the video to make it fair use
[2017-01-18 23:45:43 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @DarksydePhil, Phil, just claim it for ad revenue is my suggestion. Then you'll make money off of the people who want to use your content in their own negative way.
[2017-01-18 23:46:01 UTC] gorillabaz: I would like to think the people who are mirroring stuff aren't stupid enough to monetize
[2017-01-18 23:46:07 UTC] slashingtomcat: the videos are never monetised so he can't
[2017-01-18 23:46:12 UTC] donniedarksouls: @darksydephil could you not sue yt since it durectly effects your livelyhood, is there no protection for you?
[2017-01-18 23:46:28 UTC] darksydephil: slashingtomcat, none of that is fair use
[2017-01-18 23:46:31 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: as long as the material is transformative thoug, and it can not be defaming
[2017-01-18 23:46:31 UTC] darksydephil: sorry, its not
[2017-01-18 23:46:39 UTC] darksydephil: my lawyer said so
[2017-01-18 23:47:07 UTC] gorillabaz: You Tube has provided him with a platform to make a living for 8 years nows it would be a bit shit to try and sue them
[2017-01-18 23:47:12 UTC] darksydephil: truth is, i could claim every single video on youtube that uses my footage for ad revenue purposes, but i dont have the time or resources to find every single one
[2017-01-18 23:47:14 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Yea yea we all heard that, just move on
[2017-01-18 23:47:17 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @Slashingtomcat, That's not what a "parody" is.
[2017-01-18 23:47:29 UTC] darksydephil: people used to tell me about them, now i dont even bother. im too busy doing my own thing
[2017-01-18 23:47:30 UTC] lemonplaysgames: A parody is using your "own" work and paroding someone elses.
[2017-01-18 23:47:35 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: you should at least do a few to set an example
[2017-01-18 23:47:42 UTC] rickymt: Why dont you have the time to do it, I understand not having money but how are you so busy?
[2017-01-18 23:47:44 UTC] darksydephil: i did in the past
[2017-01-18 23:47:55 UTC] gorillabaz: Viking people have tried and failed in the past
[2017-01-18 23:48:02 UTC] darksydephil: im not going to sit here and scour youtube daily for new *** videos and the like, thats nuts lol
[2017-01-18 23:48:08 UTC] darksydegeoff: It sucks that you can't take like the negative publicity because it fucks with your search engine results
[2017-01-18 23:48:22 UTC] slashingtomcat: "Fair use is a legal doctrine that says you can reuse copyright-protected material under certain circumstances without getting permission from the copyright owner. ... Works that create new meaning for the source material may be considered fair use." If the uploaders claim theres a different meanin they could probably claim it is fair use
[2017-01-18 23:48:26 UTC] gorillabaz: There's a big freak out about free speech when people start mass claiming videos
[2017-01-18 23:48:31 UTC] darksydegeoff: Which I'm assuming is where the majority of your views are being lost to
[2017-01-18 23:48:37 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Viking dsp doesnt have money to do it, just deal with it and let them be
[2017-01-18 23:48:56 UTC] darksydegeoff: Like for LowTierGod, he gets a lot of views but nowhere near as many as the ones his haters make of him getting literal millions to his 10,000 views
[2017-01-18 23:49:12 UTC] darksydephil: exactly
[2017-01-18 23:49:21 UTC] donniedarksouls: @gorillabaz yr arent really gonna care if phil does that, it would be inefficient for them to deal with hom on an individual level since hes small frie hes just the casualty of the system
[2017-01-18 23:49:23 UTC] gorillabaz: You could look on it on the bright side in that you're getting exposure through those channels.
[2017-01-18 23:49:41 UTC] darksydephil: their videos show up in YT search because they're crazy hour-long hatefests, and dumbfuck kids sit there and watch the entire slanderous videos. so they get high ranking in search
[2017-01-18 23:50:11 UTC] darksydephil: my videos almost never show in YT search anymore because of the 2015 false copyright fiasco
[2017-01-18 23:50:13 UTC] gorillabaz: Whats that saying "No publicity is bad publicity
[2017-01-18 23:50:15 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yea it is sort of a bit unfair that your hater videos shows up related to your own
[2017-01-18 23:50:47 UTC] darksydegeoff: lol some of them literally just copy/paste your videos with like almost no editing and just call it ***
[2017-01-18 23:51:14 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Give up, u cant do anything about it bcos its more popular
[2017-01-18 23:51:15 UTC] donniedarksouls: I watch tihydp, i think they're entertaining and people have some genuine points to make
[2017-01-18 23:51:18 UTC] darksydegeoff: It's uhhhhhh disheartening
[2017-01-18 23:51:25 UTC] gorillabaz: It's not the whole videos though is it?
[2017-01-18 23:51:33 UTC] darksydegeoff: Some of them just take the entire playthrough yeah
[2017-01-18 23:51:41 UTC] donniedarksouls: If you're smart @darksydephil youll listen to your haters AND your fans
[2017-01-18 23:51:42 UTC] darksydegeoff: I don't know too much I barely spend time with that shit now
[2017-01-18 23:52:23 UTC] darksydephil: donnie
[2017-01-18 23:52:28 UTC] slashingtomcat: @DarksydeGeoff it's mainly parts the uploaders consider his worst moments
[2017-01-18 23:52:28 UTC] darksydephil: you have to be intelligent about this
[2017-01-18 23:52:41 UTC] darksydephil: those videos directly steal from me and harm my business for their own personal gain
[2017-01-18 23:52:49 UTC] gorillabaz: I was under the impression they were Phils videos shortened down to show the most interesting bits with some humour thrown in
[2017-01-18 23:52:51 UTC] darksydephil: when you watch them, you're directly contributing to my failure on YT and inability to make more videos
[2017-01-18 23:53:01 UTC] darksydephil: so by watching TIHYDP, you actually hurt yourself if you like my content....
[2017-01-18 23:53:09 UTC] darksydephil: how can you consciously choose to keep watching?
[2017-01-18 23:53:25 UTC] lemonplaysgames: That's how they were at first Gorilla, now they're nothing but hate.
[2017-01-18 23:53:36 UTC] darksydephil: its like a crazy paradox NOBODY wants to think about or admit
[2017-01-18 23:53:41 UTC] donniedarksouls: Because i watch you aswell i enjoy digesting your content in a variety of different forms
[2017-01-18 23:53:52 UTC] howling_god: cuck
[2017-01-18 23:53:56 UTC] gorillabaz: Is they problem that they make Phil look bad?
[2017-01-18 23:53:57 UTC] darksydephil: let's all watch *** but never actually admit that it's destroyed Phil's business since 2012. take no responsibility for it
[2017-01-18 23:54:05 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Its a compilation of ur fails, its just that simple
[2017-01-18 23:54:09 UTC] darksydegeoff: @donniedarksouls I understand where you're coming from but there is no content to watch if he goes down, that's the problem Phil has
[2017-01-18 23:54:16 UTC] darksydephil: donnie, *** isn't my content. its illegal theft of my content for someone else's gain
[2017-01-18 23:54:26 UTC] darksydephil: and it will END ME if people don't understand that
[2017-01-18 23:54:38 UTC] darksydephil: you're literally shooting YOURSELF in the foot watching those videos
[2017-01-18 23:54:43 UTC] donniedarksouls: And thats the way i enjoy it so thats the way i watch them, noone can be totally altruistic in every aspect of their lives sometimes youve just got to do what you want to do and not think about the greater good
[2017-01-18 23:54:45 UTC] rickymt: Has the thought ever crossed your mind that your own personality contributed to your downfall?
[2017-01-18 23:54:58 UTC] howling_god: im sure you can scrounge some bucks, angryjoe
[2017-01-18 23:55:06 UTC] hippostabber: are you saying fair use for parody or transformaitive works isnt a thing jw
[2017-01-18 23:55:14 UTC] gorillabaz: Why do other big youtubers not seem to have this same issue though or at least not to the level that you have it?
[2017-01-18 23:55:21 UTC] darksydephil: you just said it
[2017-01-18 23:55:24 UTC] darksydephil: because they're big
[2017-01-18 23:55:29 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @mrmarlboroz But it's not that simple. It would be that simple if it were just that, but what about the youtube comments that they rip and put on blast as well? Those comments are filled with hate.
[2017-01-18 23:55:29 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: go read the defonition of parody
[2017-01-18 23:55:31 UTC] darksydephil: i was never big on a scale wehre that stuff woudln't hurt me
[2017-01-18 23:55:39 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: IF it only where that easy phil, you are a public figue, but not public enough obviously
[2017-01-18 23:55:49 UTC] darksydephil: and when i was growing to that size, *** singlehandedly flipped common opinion about me and stifled that growth
[2017-01-18 23:55:55 UTC] donniedarksouls: I told you phil i watch you aswell, and im pretty sure my positive impact outweighs my negative if you want to change my mind youll have to show me some concrete proof, but thats difficult to come by
[2017-01-18 23:55:57 UTC] gorillabaz: But even content creator on par with you - do they have this problem?
[2017-01-18 23:56:15 UTC] darksydegeoff: I mean real talk @RickyMT, like-- the dude is just trying to make a living-- if people don't like it, they should just ignore it rather than just put another human being in a shitty position
[2017-01-18 23:56:20 UTC] slashingtomcat: because Phil had trouble with MGS and then evilaj made the first ever *** and it took off after how successful that one was
[2017-01-18 23:56:23 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @hippostabber That's not what a parody is, lol...
[2017-01-18 23:56:34 UTC] darksydephil: donnie, the concrete proof will be when i'm gone from YT and twitch permanently because i can't pay my fucking bills!
[2017-01-18 23:56:35 UTC] donniedarksouls: And i mean prodd that im overall hurting you by the way
[2017-01-18 23:56:48 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Or just make ur own tihydp, but u gave that up fast
[2017-01-18 23:56:50 UTC] howling_god: you flipped opinion on yourselves phil
[2017-01-18 23:56:51 UTC] hippostabber: i said parody or transformative
[2017-01-18 23:56:54 UTC] lemonplaysgames: A parody is something like what jack did with leafy in one of his videos.
[2017-01-18 23:56:55 UTC] darksydegeoff: That's the biggest problem I have, trolling and being a mild dickhead is okay, but when you actually fuck with someone's life, you're wrecking yourself, you know?
[2017-01-18 23:57:12 UTC] skysands2017: Hey hello! I missed the stream unfortunately. Are you uploading the vids now to YT?
[2017-01-18 23:57:16 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Well, none of them are a form of parody.
[2017-01-18 23:57:24 UTC] donniedarksouls: And that wont be down to me, i have a miniscule effect regardless and i watch your channel more than anyone elses particular channel
[2017-01-18 23:57:32 UTC] gorillabaz: Phil if the worst came to the worst and fingers crossed it doens't couldn't you do it part time?
[2017-01-18 23:57:33 UTC] darksydephil: it's called the difference between being a mature adult with a conscience, or an immature vile shit who will take pleasure in the pain of others Geoff
[2017-01-18 23:57:46 UTC] darksydephil: sadly the vast majority of YT viewers are immature little shits
[2017-01-18 23:58:00 UTC] donniedarksouls: Id like you tp succeed even though i dont always like you as a person
[2017-01-18 23:58:02 UTC] howling_god: cucks*
[2017-01-18 23:58:03 UTC] mrsirlogan: then stop uploading?
[2017-01-18 23:58:13 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: if they steal your content can't you steal theirs thoguh phil?
[2017-01-18 23:58:24 UTC] slashingtomcat: @LemonPlaysGames it doesn't have to necessarily be a parody to pass as fair use a lot of these uploaders say they're criticisinghis play throughs
[2017-01-18 23:58:25 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @howling_god Do you want attention? EleGiggle
[2017-01-18 23:58:36 UTC] darksydephil: LOL that's right! Give up, stop uploading altogether. give up doing what i love for a living, lose the house, destroy my credit and lose everything. sounds like a sound game plan!
[2017-01-18 23:58:42 UTC] darksydephil: that's what dumbfuck kids say
[2017-01-18 23:58:42 UTC] skysands2017: I agree. I just read the comments there on your YT videos, I refuse to believe they are coming from a mature human being
[2017-01-18 23:58:44 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @slashingtomcat Oh, I'm sure tjey do.
[2017-01-18 23:58:47 UTC] mrmarlboroz: They watch wutever interests them, wuts wrong with that? Even if its ur fails
[2017-01-18 23:58:48 UTC] mrsirlogan: Get a real job?\
[2017-01-18 23:58:48 UTC] donniedarksouls: But you need to take more pragmatic view than this, you need to find a way to use it to your advantage. Personally id make my own fuck up montages
[2017-01-18 23:58:49 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: you have to be SICK to try to destroy someones business... not immature
[2017-01-18 23:59:12 UTC] howling_god: why ban for real job
[2017-01-18 23:59:13 UTC] lightweightbro: There's a huge fucking difference between those troll montages and what, lets say, Dasboschitt did in the past. The Dasboschitt content was a parody, what the montages are are just pieced together playthroughs showing the worst moments making Phil look bad
[2017-01-18 23:59:16 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: In theory couldn't you make your own *** channel montize it and at least take the earnings from them?or is that jsut stupid?
[2017-01-18 23:59:22 UTC] gorillabaz: The problem is Viking is if you go down the road of shutting down people channels for that the maybe whole issue regarding copyrights of games could become an issue
[2017-01-18 23:59:28 UTC] darksydephil: donnie, i did last year. they got no viewership at all. nobody wants to watch someone make fun of tehmselves bc they want to see the VILE side of it. the scathing insults and the like
[2017-01-18 23:59:28 UTC] howling_god: why not be wagecuck rather than be cucked
[2017-01-18 23:59:32 UTC] hippostabber: so none of those videos are transformitive
[2017-01-18 23:59:33 UTC] skysands2017: BTW Phil. I'm the guy who drew that Pokemon fanart :)
[2017-01-18 23:59:37 UTC] slashingtomcat: the DSP anime opening is a parody
[2017-01-18 23:59:46 UTC] lightweightbro: nice fan art @skysands2017 good job!
[2017-01-18 23:59:51 UTC] donniedarksouls: Yh you should go with that
[2017-01-18 23:59:52 UTC] darksydephil: thanks skysands! It's awesome
