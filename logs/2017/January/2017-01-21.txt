[2017-01-21 20:03:49 UTC] akioartorius: Because both candidates suck, jimboob

[2017-01-21 20:05:07 UTC] bluejoey1800: That was hilarious when Hilary caught Bill staring at Ivanka (Most likely)
[2017-01-21 20:05:08 UTC] theycallmejimbob: No worries akio,but there was no protests or riots when Hillary was predicted to win.
[2017-01-21 20:06:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Michelle Obama had a scowl on her face the whole day.
[2017-01-21 20:07:07 UTC] bethe2670: lol she was soooo upset about leaving in her mind HER HOME

[2017-01-21 20:07:38 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it was more of trump being president than leaving the White House
[2017-01-21 20:08:08 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob you'd be upset and angry if you were FORCED to leave your house after 8 years
[2017-01-21 20:08:43 UTC] taurusoxford: She had 8 years to realize that was gonna happen though
[2017-01-21 20:08:52 UTC] bethe2670: true
[2017-01-21 20:09:15 UTC] theycallmejimbob: but bethe you know you're only there for 4 or 8 years,she campaigned for Hillary,Trump according to the media had a 2% chance of winning and here we are.
[2017-01-21 20:09:18 UTC] bethe2670: plus the obamas dont like trump at all
[2017-01-21 20:10:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: why didn't I put a bet on the trump election :( it mirrored what happened for brexit
[2017-01-21 20:11:13 UTC] theycallmejimbob: presidential*
[2017-01-21 20:11:15 UTC] popsicolo: I need to put together my combat suit for the Trumpocalypse. I hope didn't sell my gas mask.
[2017-01-21 20:11:24 UTC] taurusoxford: So did Phil say he was gonna start late?

[2017-01-21 20:15:32 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bethe the big game is in 10 days against Liverpool
[2017-01-21 20:15:36 UTC] bethe2670: usually he here by now
[2017-01-21 20:15:37 UTC] neonbornspartan9: All I watch is Bundelsliga and LaLiga; only English team i'm kinda interested in is mancity
[2017-01-21 20:15:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: they got unlucky today against Spurs
[2017-01-21 20:15:56 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob yeah and chelsea will beat the reds down
[2017-01-21 20:16:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: were*
[2017-01-21 20:16:22 UTC] megamannt125: Why did Phil take down his christmas tree in mid january?
[2017-01-21 20:16:24 UTC] bethe2670: really eh cause fuck tottenham they are second
[2017-01-21 20:16:26 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Hazard doing better this year
[2017-01-21 20:16:36 UTC] bethe2670: thank god
[2017-01-21 20:17:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yeah bethe2670 Man city were by far the better team, Sterling should of had a penalty at 2-1 but the ref messed up and Spurs got the equalizer.
[2017-01-21 20:17:22 UTC] alex_dragonul: Btw is Res evil 7 a reboot , if so then will ti be only in FP and be like Amnesia and others games that fallowed its formula ?
[2017-01-21 20:17:30 UTC] neonbornspartan9: I like the way hazard dribbles and plays; my playstyle resembles him, messi, and robben. Simple touch dribbles
[2017-01-21 20:17:48 UTC] bethe2670: i fucking hope resi 7 is not that
[2017-01-21 20:18:01 UTC] bethe2670: cause i will never play a resi game again
[2017-01-21 20:18:21 UTC] bethe2670: messi and robben are world class
[2017-01-21 20:18:28 UTC] bethe2670: just like hazard
[2017-01-21 20:18:46 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: he maximises efficiency of christmas trees by having them standing for long
[2017-01-21 20:18:52 UTC] theycallmejimbob: lol vsevolodeliseev
[2017-01-21 20:19:07 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Their dribbling style is simple, fast, and effective; it's not like Ronaldo where they try to trick you out
[2017-01-21 20:19:11 UTC] bethe2670: but he will have the same xmas tree next year
[2017-01-21 20:19:31 UTC] bethe2670: ronaldo is too cocky thats why he does tricks
[2017-01-21 20:20:14 UTC] alex_dragonul: Yea me too , i love those games but res evil 7 doesn't need to another one of those , i heard it is the real final entry in the main series and then they will reboot it ? i hope so bc Wesker brother i think would have been the next main villain or something
[2017-01-21 20:20:25 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Point of dribbling is to rush into space and create space for a pass or score a goal if close enough; I think Ronaldo doesn't understand that sometimes
[2017-01-21 20:21:18 UTC] bethe2670: ronaldo is too confident and cocky, he thinks oh i have the ball no one will ever get it off me so imma do some tricks hurr hurr
[2017-01-21 20:21:57 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Mempis depay and a lot of other players are like that sadly lol
[2017-01-21 20:22:30 UTC] bethe2670: they think they are the best in the world when they are not
[2017-01-21 20:23:29 UTC] neonbornspartan9: They'd be better if they cut the bs lol; I think Ronaldo has good touch and shooting tho
[2017-01-21 20:23:54 UTC] bethe2670: yep
[2017-01-21 20:24:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: sad Depay didn't work out at Man Utd,I don't think he was really given a chance
[2017-01-21 20:24:38 UTC] neonbornspartan9: manU is a mess past couple of years
[2017-01-21 20:24:41 UTC] neonbornspartan9: imo
[2017-01-21 20:25:11 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Yup Moyes was a horrible appointment

[2017-01-21 20:28:25 UTC] megamannt125: They remixed it for Dragon Roost Island in Wind Waker
[2017-01-21 20:28:31 UTC] darksydephil: guess it depends on what this next dungeon in the deser is lol
[2017-01-21 20:28:33 UTC] xxkillerstormxx: Re7 can't wait till the release
[2017-01-21 20:28:34 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Spanish guitar music phil, I can send you links to good ones.

[2017-01-21 20:28:51 UTC] darksydephil: cool

[2017-01-21 20:29:39 UTC] bethe2670: the gerudo music is the second best music in this game, only the forest maze music is better in my opinion
[2017-01-21 20:29:43 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: if you mean on difficulty pro exploiter, crash bandicoots more the darks souls for kids
[2017-01-21 20:29:44 UTC] proexploiter: miss those days
[2017-01-21 20:29:45 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: :P
[2017-01-21 20:29:53 UTC] ukyo9: I think there's an high chance for you to finish today
[2017-01-21 20:30:05 UTC] xxkillerstormxx: That's a good template.
[2017-01-21 20:30:05 UTC] bluejoey1800: PPhil should paly the new Nioh demo after beating a dungeon "P

[2017-01-21 20:34:55 UTC] bethe2670: phil the Proper order of temples is SHADOW then SPIRIT in that order
[2017-01-21 20:35:11 UTC] bethe2670: and phil you look like you are going to do the spirit first
[2017-01-21 20:35:23 UTC] fac316: ttt2 DansGame
[2017-01-21 20:35:30 UTC] sootiestgameo: because that was when i first found out about you and the content you made surprisingly
[2017-01-21 20:35:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he still has to do the prestream for youtube i_am_bane_
[2017-01-21 20:35:46 UTC] sureflight: the medalions show to do spirit first
[2017-01-21 20:35:54 UTC] darksydephil: i mprobably not doing a formal prestream today
[2017-01-21 20:36:01 UTC] nerv117: ok
[2017-01-21 20:36:02 UTC] ahfear: good
[2017-01-21 20:36:18 UTC] i_am_bane_: another prestream?
[2017-01-21 20:36:18 UTC] violetkitty: Nah he can do Spirit first
[2017-01-21 20:36:36 UTC] violetkitty: Platforming may be a wee bit more tricky but it's possible
[2017-01-21 20:37:00 UTC] dxfreedom: not playing nioh demo?
[2017-01-21 20:37:12 UTC] darksydephil: considering the game hasn't given me any clue where the shadow temple is
[2017-01-21 20:37:14 UTC] bethe2670: i hope he rages again like he did in gerudo fortress and the bottom of the well :D
[2017-01-21 20:37:19 UTC] darksydephil: i dont see how its my fault if im doing another one first
[2017-01-21 20:37:30 UTC] nerv117: shadow temple is adult hookshot in the graveyard
[2017-01-21 20:37:42 UTC] deadlyriot920: donmt tell him that...
[2017-01-21 20:37:45 UTC] ahfear: more rage soon?

[2017-01-21 20:37:51 UTC] nerv117: he wouldnt know otherwise
[2017-01-21 20:37:55 UTC] ahfear: yea no hand holding
[2017-01-21 20:38:01 UTC] violetkitty: Should've indicated to him where it would be at on the map
[2017-01-21 20:38:07 UTC] violetkitty: That or Navi would've mentioned it
[2017-01-21 20:38:13 UTC] deadlyriot920: @nerv117 so what its bettrer to figure out himself
[2017-01-21 20:38:14 UTC] bethe2670: all whats going to happen is he will struggle with the spirit temple and then be lost forever
[2017-01-21 20:38:14 UTC] neonbornspartan9: I can't believe the violent protesters; just making things worse, or taking advantage of the situation to be vandels. People are so stupid...
[2017-01-21 20:38:21 UTC] nerv117: he still has to figure out how to open it
[2017-01-21 20:38:28 UTC] bethe2670: until someone tells him
[2017-01-21 20:38:32 UTC] violetkitty: I could've sworn it specifically mentions where to go for the Shadow Temple
[2017-01-21 20:38:41 UTC] mfd4419: Hi everyone hey phill

[2017-01-21 20:38:56 UTC] bethe2670: the shadow temple is meant to be after BOTTOM OF THE WELL
[2017-01-21 20:39:01 UTC] thefrozenjay: Dspussy
[2017-01-21 20:39:04 UTC] bethe2670: then you do gerudo fortress
[2017-01-21 20:39:06 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey mfd4419
[2017-01-21 20:39:13 UTC] deadlyriot920: @nerv117 point being is you told him a key advantage to get in
[2017-01-21 20:39:21 UTC] violetkitty: You can do either Spirit Temple or Shadow Temple after Bottom of the Well
[2017-01-21 20:39:24 UTC] nerv117: i just told him the enterance
[2017-01-21 20:39:26 UTC] kindofahater18: I just seen a live reaction to Zelda Breath of The Wild and it brought me to tears because everyone was so excited it's so awesome to see how passionate people are of video games.
[2017-01-21 20:39:28 UTC] nerv117: the rest is up to him
[2017-01-21 20:39:29 UTC] jamiepaulbaldwin: i like dressing up as a horse and running around my living room shouting ride me daddy!!!

[2017-01-21 20:39:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh boy
[2017-01-21 20:39:52 UTC] violetkitty: You can't even do Spirit Temple without the Lens of Truth because it's needed to trigger the ghost leading to it
[2017-01-21 20:40:00 UTC] brigmore: Oh boyardee
[2017-01-21 20:40:02 UTC] neonbornspartan9: really, I call those kind of people weebos TriHard

[2017-01-21 20:40:14 UTC] thedoctor5437: /me rides @jamiepaulbaldwin and slaps his butt
[2017-01-21 20:40:15 UTC] sootiestgameo: oh man i forgot
[2017-01-21 20:40:16 UTC] sureflight: @bethe2670, it a pretty open game you can do either shadow or spirit, ame with water or fire
[2017-01-21 20:40:24 UTC] sootiestgameo: did phil play king of fighters 14?
[2017-01-21 20:40:49 UTC] bethe2670: but the proper order of temples is forest, fire, water, shadow and spirit
[2017-01-21 20:41:06 UTC] sureflight: but if you look at the medalions it goes spirit then shadow
[2017-01-21 20:41:09 UTC] bethe2670: just like with the kid link three forest, fire, water
[2017-01-21 20:41:09 UTC] kingjadvcmp: hey guys, I'm currently in the UK - what time is it in PST, out of curiosity? It is 8:41pm here
