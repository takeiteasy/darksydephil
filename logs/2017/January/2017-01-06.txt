[2017-01-06 20:04:35 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @Pr34ch, Yeah, Dark Souls 1 wasn't very well optimized for any system. While it runs good for the most part, there's always those certain areas like Blight Town that won't run perfectly. I know the lava area w/ the Ceaseless Discharge boss runs like absolute crap on PC.
[2017-01-06 20:04:37 UTC] gaylordbutthump: Demon's Souls > BB > Dark Souls > Dark Souls 3

[2017-01-06 20:06:59 UTC] jackwhite2000: i saw that you finished Yu Yu Hakusho so i thought youd go back to DBZ after that
[2017-01-06 20:07:05 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bethe2670, noone wanted to see Phil play Sonic instead Kappa
[2017-01-06 20:07:07 UTC] ukyo9: But what character will Phil run? Should he go fat knight like during his first playthrough? Is this the resurrection of Dumass, @DarksydePhil ?
[2017-01-06 20:07:08 UTC] zawarud00: Yuyu hakusho is a classic
[2017-01-06 20:07:12 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i hated demon's souls at first but i did horrible with allocating my stats so it was a really miserable run
[2017-01-06 20:07:13 UTC] bethe2670: pops vidar gave 10k bits today lol
[2017-01-06 20:07:15 UTC] zawarud00: Only thing bad about it was the ending
[2017-01-06 20:07:20 UTC] gaylordbutthump: second time and every other time has been amazing though
[2017-01-06 20:07:39 UTC] popsicolo: You should check out 1990's Berserk Anime Phil. It would be a perfect companion to playing Dark Souls since it inspired it.
[2017-01-06 20:07:53 UTC] ladypeorth: There is the Berserk Musou as well
[2017-01-06 20:07:54 UTC] deltaforce355: really pop?
[2017-01-06 20:07:54 UTC] snipertheladiesman: i hate demons souls for how clunky it is compared to DS1 and onwards
[2017-01-06 20:08:02 UTC] darksydephil: just saw your fanart pops, adding it now

[2017-01-06 20:08:13 UTC] bethe2670: i hate the entire souls frachise
[2017-01-06 20:08:15 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Dark SOuls exists because of Berserk. I still need to collect the rest of the volumes.
[2017-01-06 20:08:23 UTC] alldaythreeam: dark souls better not be a disappointment
[2017-01-06 20:08:23 UTC] bethe2670: including bloodborne
[2017-01-06 20:08:25 UTC] popsicolo: But yeah, Ill even point out Berserk references on stream today.
[2017-01-06 20:08:27 UTC] snipertheladiesman: i think i duped glitched souls to get up to 200+ just to beat it but i'm like half through ng+

[2017-01-06 20:16:18 UTC] yacherdy: Dark Souls on PC is an ugly port I gotta say.

[2017-01-06 20:16:36 UTC] 0megaj0ker: you need a mod to get that game to work
[2017-01-06 20:16:37 UTC] retrocerberus: phil read item descriptions this time

[2017-01-06 20:16:45 UTC] retrocerberus: for lore!
[2017-01-06 20:16:51 UTC] humpiershaggy: DS on PC WAS an crap port. It's vastly improved now. Especially with the 60fps mod
[2017-01-06 20:16:58 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @YaCherdy, I wish they'd redo the port. Perhaps even just remaster the game for PS4 and Xbox One, then also bring that remaster to PC.
[2017-01-06 20:16:58 UTC] jaykirkbride: Dsfix makes the PC version the definitive version in my opinion
[2017-01-06 20:16:59 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Gino, you should practice your Mod skills on Bethe since you're still learning. Bethe don't mind.

[2017-01-06 20:17:19 UTC] the_ace_detective: Or the Dark Souls wiki.

[2017-01-06 20:17:26 UTC] zawarud00: nobody plays this game for the story

[2017-01-06 20:17:38 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: I actually like it, what sucks is that it got cut from the game, basically
[2017-01-06 20:17:40 UTC] retrocerberus: Jebaited
[2017-01-06 20:17:47 UTC] jackwhite2000: i played dark souls 2 and still have no idea what the fuck the plot is
[2017-01-06 20:17:49 UTC] yacherdy: @LemonPlaysGames Yeah I read that they found out fans wanted a PC port and they just threw it together quickly even though the game wasn't made for PC originally.

[2017-01-06 20:17:58 UTC] lemonplaysgames: DSfix isn't perfect though. You can't slide down the ladders in fear of sliding down through the ground, and while it does stay at 60 fps the majority of the time, certain areas like Ceaseless Discharge still runs like poo.
