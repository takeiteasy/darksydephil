[2017-01-26 20:18:21 UTC] azuredragoongx1: There are festivals that the Yakuza organize, that has attendance in the ten thousands
[2017-01-26 20:18:25 UTC] azuredragoongx1: I don't think so :P
[2017-01-26 20:18:51 UTC] popsicolo: In selfish head, there's no freedom TriHard
[2017-01-26 20:19:07 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Damn Popsi, misinterpreting "For Faith..."

[2017-01-26 20:19:16 UTC] jackwhite2000: from all you said the yakuza seems like a legal organization
[2017-01-26 20:19:28 UTC] azuredragoongx1: They do partake in legal activities
[2017-01-26 20:19:37 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Though of course in their own way xD

[2017-01-26 20:20:10 UTC] fatestayjedi: they are so big i guess the cops aren't powerful enough to take them down even if they wanted?
[2017-01-26 20:20:12 UTC] jackwhite2000: i just learned a lot more today about japan
[2017-01-26 20:20:22 UTC] akioartorius: hello Phil

[2017-01-26 20:20:33 UTC] popsicolo: Aliens WutFace
[2017-01-26 20:20:34 UTC] azuredragoongx1: The Yakuza are a double-edge; they like to help Japan whenever they can
[2017-01-26 20:20:39 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Such as the 2011 earthquakes
[2017-01-26 20:20:49 UTC] azuredragoongx1: It took weeks for the government to send help
[2017-01-26 20:20:51 UTC] popsicolo: "I want surgery to look Japanese" -Phil
[2017-01-26 20:20:52 UTC] fatestayjedi: nice guys
[2017-01-26 20:20:56 UTC] azuredragoongx1: But the Yakuza were right there

[2017-01-26 20:21:05 UTC] neonbornspartan9: What the fuck is Yakuza, it sounds like some weeb shit TriHard
[2017-01-26 20:21:12 UTC] splitplaythru: About 50 hours of gameplay for me when I beat it for first time.
[2017-01-26 20:21:19 UTC] jackwhite2000: @neonbornspartan9 japanesse mafai
[2017-01-26 20:21:23 UTC] jackwhite2000: mafia*
[2017-01-26 20:21:26 UTC] splitplaythru: that is of course, assuming DSP will do sidequests
[2017-01-26 20:21:38 UTC] the_ace_detective: Sidequests in this game are super good.
[2017-01-26 20:21:38 UTC] splitplaythru: Yakuza 0 has over 100 of sidequests
[2017-01-26 20:21:42 UTC] azuredragoongx1: DSP won't 100% this xD
[2017-01-26 20:21:43 UTC] jackwhite2000: brb

[2017-01-26 20:21:46 UTC] azuredragoongx1: It's just too much
[2017-01-26 20:21:49 UTC] neonbornspartan9: I thought it was a dance game cause of Phil's funniest moment countdown.
[2017-01-26 20:21:51 UTC] fatestayjedi: i want the dance off with the fat chick again
[2017-01-26 20:21:52 UTC] the_ace_detective: One thing I do wonder though... how will he handle Mister Shakedown?
[2017-01-26 20:21:53 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Plus, the secret boss is CHAOS
[2017-01-26 20:21:54 UTC] akioartorius: what happen to the Yakuza game that was in feudal times?
[2017-01-26 20:22:04 UTC] azuredragoongx1: No export for us
[2017-01-26 20:22:11 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Not for Kenzan or Ishin
[2017-01-26 20:22:15 UTC] bwt56: At least some of them
[2017-01-26 20:22:16 UTC] bethe2670: imma need a lot of snacks to not ResidentSleeper for this game
[2017-01-26 20:22:19 UTC] the_ace_detective: I think that's hard to translate it since it has nothing to do with Yakuzas, just the JP title 'Like A Dragon.'
[2017-01-26 20:22:19 UTC] bethe2670: ugh
[2017-01-26 20:22:22 UTC] nerv117: only mainline games come here
[2017-01-26 20:22:24 UTC] d_alien: yooo, DSP still jerking off behind cam?

[2017-01-26 20:22:43 UTC] fatestayjedi: @D_alien you still gay and looking to jerk off on him?
[2017-01-26 20:22:45 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you don't like this game bethe2670?
[2017-01-26 20:22:47 UTC] akioartorius: Bathroom
[2017-01-26 20:22:56 UTC] the_ace_detective: Which is a bit sad, I'd like to play 'em. But maybe I'll start importing one day or something, once I can be bothered to read JP.
[2017-01-26 20:23:02 UTC] the_ace_detective: What's not to like?
[2017-01-26 20:23:02 UTC] azuredragoongx1: I hate the secret boss so much in this game...
[2017-01-26 20:23:05 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh god Split, I saw that in a review LUL
[2017-01-26 20:23:05 UTC] bwt56: Why tf is it putting 2 of the same comments after someone comments lol

[2017-01-26 20:25:45 UTC] elipsion: I think Ahri Okita modeled for this game Kreygasm

[2017-01-26 20:25:56 UTC] the_ace_detective: I'm not far into the game, just chapter 4. But woman wrestling ring? Holy hell, I have to go faster.
[2017-01-26 20:26:02 UTC] azuredragoongx1: And I must say, the story is amazing

[2017-01-26 20:27:25 UTC] splitplaythru: Is it certain that Phil's video quality he records is NOT influenced by streaming at the same time?
[2017-01-26 20:28:05 UTC] splitplaythru: I'm using Elgato HD60 myself, and whenever I stream and record at the same time, my recordings suffer in quality. This doesn't happen if I'm only recording.
[2017-01-26 20:28:07 UTC] shotinthedeep: It affects it a little bit since he can get distracted

[2017-01-26 20:31:39 UTC] the_ace_detective: I doubt she was even born when the game takes place.
[2017-01-26 20:31:39 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Neither will Akiyama
[2017-01-26 20:31:50 UTC] jackwhite2000: wasnt there a large woman in 5 whom you had a dance with?
[2017-01-26 20:31:55 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Yes

[2017-01-26 20:52:16 UTC] blue_blur64: And that's why no other game did it Kappa

[2017-01-26 20:52:33 UTC] the_ace_detective: I think it was a good decision. As much as I prefer english dubs, JP voices make more sense for Yakuza.
[2017-01-26 20:52:37 UTC] the_ace_detective: Ronsaku.

[2017-01-26 20:53:20 UTC] dukaduka: well this cut scene style is awfully outdated
[2017-01-26 20:53:33 UTC] the_ace_detective: But yeah. I think the point of this cutscene style (which isn't a very frequent one) is to help you see the emotions a bit more without them moving their mouths.
[2017-01-26 20:53:37 UTC] bethe2670: this is like 3ds style cutscene
[2017-01-26 20:53:38 UTC] the_ace_detective: It's a weird way to do it, but it grows on me.

[2017-01-26 20:54:08 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Knowing well that this isn't because of Yakuza studio's poor budget, I don't have a problem with this style
[2017-01-26 20:54:11 UTC] akioartorius: so no animated cutscenes huh
[2017-01-26 20:54:15 UTC] popsicolo: What is this, the Aquaman game?

[2017-01-26 20:55:22 UTC] azuredragoongx1: So they had to make do
[2017-01-26 20:55:29 UTC] the_ace_detective: It's a good thing this game has both story and fight scenes in spades ;D
[2017-01-26 20:55:31 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Which meant up until now, we barely got these games

[2017-01-26 22:42:30 UTC] azuredragoongx1: They did at one point
[2017-01-26 22:42:31 UTC] the_ace_detective: It wasn't the best quality
[2017-01-26 22:42:34 UTC] azuredragoongx1: And it wasn't great
[2017-01-26 22:42:37 UTC] vince329: Kinggoken they did, and it sucked balls
[2017-01-26 22:42:37 UTC] kinggoken: lol
[2017-01-26 22:42:42 UTC] the_ace_detective: It's kinda better this way honestly. Makes more sense for them to speak Japanese.

[2017-01-26 22:44:23 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: what a cinematic game
[2017-01-26 22:44:26 UTC] the_ace_detective: I appreciate that Yakuza can please a lot of people. It's got good graphics, it's got a good story, and it's got good gameplay, with tons of content.
[2017-01-26 22:44:27 UTC] azuredragoongx1: PS4
[2017-01-26 22:44:27 UTC] the_ace_detective: PS4.

[2017-01-26 22:45:38 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Is there any way to play yakuza 2 on a console other than PS2? I plan on starting out w/ zero, then playing the remake when that comes out.
[2017-01-26 22:45:39 UTC] bobbi_ling: is this a new release?
[2017-01-26 22:45:40 UTC] vince329: Bring that shit, Kazuma!

[2017-01-26 22:45:56 UTC] azuredragoongx1: In Japan, they've had it for 2 years
[2017-01-26 22:45:58 UTC] the_ace_detective: But technically it's been out for a while.
[2017-01-26 22:46:07 UTC] bobbi_ling: never heard a word about it coming out :D

[2017-01-26 22:46:15 UTC] akioartorius: sort of
[2017-01-26 22:46:16 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Some of it
[2017-01-26 22:46:26 UTC] azuredragoongx1: But there are exclusive elements in the story for this one
[2017-01-26 22:46:41 UTC] the_ace_detective: But this is a different story from the Yakuza 1 story. So... it's not exactly something where you can predict what's going to happen.
[2017-01-26 22:46:46 UTC] bobbi_ling: filler story
[2017-01-26 22:47:10 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Story that defines the two main characters
[2017-01-26 22:47:13 UTC] rbreezay: This is boring!
[2017-01-26 22:47:15 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Why they are what they are

[2017-01-26 22:48:36 UTC] the_ace_detective: It's a bit early.
[2017-01-26 22:48:36 UTC] shotinthedeep: We alread saw the 9 hour game
[2017-01-26 22:48:46 UTC] dukesdearfreja: I'd rather have fun for 9 hours, rather than 100 of dragged out skid marks
[2017-01-26 22:48:49 UTC] akioartorius: Kiryu's sideburns are not epic enough yet kappa
[2017-01-26 22:48:51 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Once I complete that game, I know I've seen it all however
[2017-01-26 22:48:57 UTC] vince329: it's a Japanese game, there's always slow starts
[2017-01-26 22:48:58 UTC] azuredragoongx1: So I never touch Resident Evil again
[2017-01-26 22:49:08 UTC] vince329: well, JRPG ish

[2017-01-26 22:49:21 UTC] azuredragoongx1: much more replay value
[2017-01-26 22:49:22 UTC] ssjram: In real life, the yakuza are just scum.

[2017-01-26 22:50:07 UTC] azuredragoongx1: But they aren't pure evil

[2017-01-26 22:50:58 UTC] ssjram: lol. Besides other sects, the Yakuza are just organized thugs that the japanese government let slide because they're intimidated.
[2017-01-26 22:50:59 UTC] gerjantv: no one is all good or all bad yo
[2017-01-26 22:51:02 UTC] somone192: Is this the boss fight

[2017-01-26 22:51:11 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I have a friend who was in a bar in Japan and saw a couple Yakuza, he thought it was pretty cool, but yeah, they're pretty intimidating according to him.
[2017-01-26 22:51:18 UTC] kinggoken: so much talking in this lol
[2017-01-26 22:51:27 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Boss fight is soon though
[2017-01-26 22:51:29 UTC] the_ace_detective: It's a natural part of life.

[2017-01-26 22:51:35 UTC] gtamatte: it's interesting
[2017-01-26 22:52:01 UTC] the_ace_detective: Hell it's not even painting Yakuza in a good light in this game. There's just the exceptional few who rise above certain things, and they're the main characters.
[2017-01-26 22:52:17 UTC] akioartorius: your car? ha
[2017-01-26 22:52:20 UTC] azuredragoongx1: Yeah real Yakuza once said Kiryu is what they used to be
[2017-01-26 22:52:25 UTC] yacherdy: I figured Yakuza would win the poll
[2017-01-26 22:52:30 UTC] kinggoken: finally some fighting!

[2017-01-26 22:52:38 UTC] azuredragoongx1: That's the 2nd time Kuze got to do that xD
[2017-01-26 22:52:40 UTC] the_ace_detective: Oh yeah they had an interview with actual Yakuza and got them to play Yakuza 3
[2017-01-26 22:52:40 UTC] dukesdearfreja: Is this game just cutscenes?
[2017-01-26 22:52:50 UTC] the_ace_detective: One of them even lost one of their fingers so they couldn't actually play the game properly.
[2017-01-26 22:53:02 UTC] the_ace_detective: No, Dukes. Gameplay is coming up in about... five minutes.
[2017-01-26 22:53:04 UTC] gtamatte: That Yakuza 3 review with the rl yakuzas was great.

[2017-01-26 22:53:44 UTC] the_ace_detective: I like all this stuff but I do understand that long dialogues might not be appealing to people just watching.
[2017-01-26 22:53:51 UTC] ssjram: The Yakuza are only relevant because Japan is such a small country. Since we have tons of groups like this in the US, japan being an island country makes them more prominent.
[2017-01-26 22:53:55 UTC] yacherdy: Yes! Kappa
[2017-01-26 22:53:57 UTC] ganochan: MICHAEL CORLEONE VS. KUZE
