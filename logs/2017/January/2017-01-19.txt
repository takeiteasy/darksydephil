[2017-01-19 00:00:06 UTC] mrmarlboroz: So u just made 1 vid and give up?
[2017-01-19 00:00:07 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @lightweightbro Let's not forget the hate comments they put on screen as well.
[2017-01-19 00:00:10 UTC] skysands2017: You're welcome. I might do more for future playthroughs
[2017-01-19 00:00:21 UTC] lightweightbro: yeah that just adds to the hurtfulness, @LemonPlaysGames
[2017-01-19 00:00:33 UTC] emnay_i_say: I think the comments are interesting.
[2017-01-19 00:00:33 UTC] lightweightbro: trolls quoting trolls
[2017-01-19 00:00:46 UTC] darksydephil: ok im out, gotta get stuff done and get dinner etc
[2017-01-19 00:00:51 UTC] gorillabaz: Its people comments on the internet though what do you expect?
[2017-01-19 00:00:51 UTC] darksydegeoff: I think the problem is @DarksydePhil is that a lot of people don't understand the repercussions for their actions. Like, people in general don't understand what it's like having to go paycheck to paycheck especially at their young age where they are under their parents' wing
[2017-01-19 00:01:06 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: have a nice dinner
[2017-01-19 00:01:08 UTC] skysands2017: Is this the REAL emnay I Say?
[2017-01-19 00:01:11 UTC] darksydegeoff: It's understandable but you know
[2017-01-19 00:01:12 UTC] emnay_i_say: Sure is.
[2017-01-19 00:01:22 UTC] howling_god: BYE BYE greasy
[2017-01-19 00:01:25 UTC] gorillabaz: Hey Geoff big fan by the way can I ask you a question?
[2017-01-19 00:01:25 UTC] darksydegeoff: It sure sucks for everyone on the other end of the stick where the culture is to be toxic af
[2017-01-19 00:01:29 UTC] donniedarksouls: You see you're already in a paradoxical situation, people watch because you rage and dislike you because you rage. But they now have a more effieciwnt way to watch rage: tihydp. So in actual fact you were ALWAYS proffiting off the vile stuff, you just didnt know it.
[2017-01-19 00:01:30 UTC] darksydegeoff: Sure thing @gorillabaz
[2017-01-19 00:01:42 UTC] slashingtomcat: you should try change your style for a playthrough and see what happens
[2017-01-19 00:01:59 UTC] howling_god: he's got no style he's got no grace
[2017-01-19 00:02:01 UTC] skysands2017: I remember you were trolling streamers who play Dark Souls 1 back in the day lol @eMnAy_I_sAy
[2017-01-19 00:02:02 UTC] gorillabaz: Were you involved with the PC version of Arkham Knight?
[2017-01-19 00:02:02 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Normal ppl doesnt care, if it interests them why wouldnt they watch it?
[2017-01-19 00:02:08 UTC] emnay_i_say: Good times.
[2017-01-19 00:02:32 UTC] darksydegeoff: Yes, my name is on it-- most questions I can't answer due to my relationship with Iron Galaxy though
[2017-01-19 00:02:44 UTC] mrmarlboroz: And dsp have no money to sue, so its up to him to pull interests back from them
[2017-01-19 00:02:49 UTC] darksydegeoff: Iron Galaxy/WB/Rocksteady etc
[2017-01-19 00:03:05 UTC] gorillabaz: Ok cool I just wondered what the hell happened with it as its awesome on the consoles
[2017-01-19 00:03:23 UTC] gorillabaz: and I understand the PC version has issues
[2017-01-19 00:03:24 UTC] slashingtomcat: it's definitely the worst of the three
[2017-01-19 00:03:29 UTC] darksydegeoff: Ahhh, I can't say anything, I'm sorry! :'(
[2017-01-19 00:03:38 UTC] gorillabaz: No worries
[2017-01-19 00:03:40 UTC] darksydegeoff: To be fair I was barely on the project though
[2017-01-19 00:03:44 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: The thing is that most the *** videos are to hatefull. If it goes from satire/parody to hate and defaming a person. it looses it's legitimasy
[2017-01-19 00:03:48 UTC] gorillabaz: Thanks for you work in any case
[2017-01-19 00:03:51 UTC] darksydegeoff: So I wouldn't even know much even if I could answer
[2017-01-19 00:03:54 UTC] darksydegeoff: No problem!
[2017-01-19 00:04:39 UTC] alex_dragonul: People , people can we please move own now ?
[2017-01-19 00:04:48 UTC] slashingtomcat: @mr_vidar_viking the re4 one was proper criticism and facts about the games so it was genuinely interesting to wath
[2017-01-19 00:05:05 UTC] mrmarlboroz: But phil wont do anything about it, yea, so stop complaining alrdy
[2017-01-19 00:05:46 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: sure it's a broad label. And you would have to evalutate something on a case to case basis
[2017-01-19 00:06:06 UTC] gorillabaz: The thing that gets me about the Phil detractor videos is that that its considerably proporational higher than anything else any other you tuber has to put up with and I wonder why that is?
[2017-01-19 00:07:12 UTC] slashingtomcat: because he rages quite a bit at difficult games and tends to do dumb things like his battle against the end in MGS3 or the old mon in demon souls
[2017-01-19 00:07:17 UTC] slashingtomcat: monk*
[2017-01-19 00:07:22 UTC] gorillabaz: Theres plenty of guys that were doing what Phil did back when it first took off and none of them have the same kind of issues
[2017-01-19 00:08:05 UTC] slashingtomcat: Phils moments tend to stand out more
[2017-01-19 00:08:21 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Do they? I have yet to find someone worse than phil in mgs3
[2017-01-19 00:08:45 UTC] darksydegeoff: A lot of people get hate but yeah DSP gets a ton more
[2017-01-19 00:08:56 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: unpropotionally
[2017-01-19 00:09:06 UTC] skysands2017: Not really. He was just unlucky to attract sick people and stalkers who constantly make videos about Phil.
[2017-01-19 00:09:17 UTC] darksydegeoff: Granted like I feel like there's gotta be a better way for him to manipulate it to his benefit
[2017-01-19 00:09:22 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: there are real scumbags on the internet who is very public but phil is NOT one of them
[2017-01-19 00:09:27 UTC] gorillabaz: I don't think its down to his gameplay as some people find that entertaining to see someone struggle and fail but eventually get there
[2017-01-19 00:09:32 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: I honestly think people have difficulty understanding how thick skinned you have to be in order to do well in youtube. I would have gone crazy long ago if I was Phil with all the critique and hate. Empathy is something most people lack, and that’s a shame I think that’s one of the greatest traits a human can have.
[2017-01-19 00:09:42 UTC] darksydegeoff: dude even if DSP was the worst gamer in the world
[2017-01-19 00:09:55 UTC] darksydegeoff: why shit on someone for not being able to press buttons as well as others
[2017-01-19 00:10:00 UTC] darksydegeoff: like it's such a stupid culture
[2017-01-19 00:10:21 UTC] nothingxs: agree
[2017-01-19 00:10:24 UTC] nothingxs: also, hi geoff <3
[2017-01-19 00:10:29 UTC] darksydegeoff: hey bud
[2017-01-19 00:10:30 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: they hate him becaues he had unwarranted success in their eyes
[2017-01-19 00:10:42 UTC] darksydegeoff: i don't think that's it
[2017-01-19 00:10:43 UTC] gorillabaz: You should do some more cat videos Geoff
[2017-01-19 00:10:44 UTC] donniedarksouls: A lot of dsp's hate is self inflicted
[2017-01-19 00:10:44 UTC] slashingtomcat: I believe it's more to do with the rage he gets when gaming rather than his gaming abilitys
[2017-01-19 00:10:47 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: see them self as better and think they can tear him down because they haven't succeded them self
[2017-01-19 00:10:52 UTC] darksydegeoff: it's just a lot of people joining a bandwagon
[2017-01-19 00:11:14 UTC] nothingxs: you know i completely missed out on this weird dsp persona that happened on the internet
[2017-01-19 00:11:16 UTC] darksydegeoff: like when retsupurae made fun of him it was the trendy thing to do after that
[2017-01-19 00:11:17 UTC] donniedarksouls: Its the nature of his popularity, the people who view him are largley detractors
[2017-01-19 00:11:25 UTC] donniedarksouls: And hes earnt those detractors in many ways
[2017-01-19 00:11:29 UTC] nothingxs: the only dsp i know was meeting him at a couple of final rounds and playing super turbo
[2017-01-19 00:11:29 UTC] darksydegeoff: i'm not blaming retsupurae those guys are cool af
[2017-01-19 00:11:49 UTC] nothingxs: so i always am surprised when people tell me "duuuuuude dsp did some shit" and i'm like did he kill a man? and it's like nah
[2017-01-19 00:11:58 UTC] nothingxs: he made a post about him eating the mcdouble w/jalapeños in it
[2017-01-19 00:12:02 UTC] donniedarksouls: Poeple as whole dont just react to nothing, they have to be provoked in some way
[2017-01-19 00:12:05 UTC] gorillabaz: but is have detractors really that bad - its exposure after all
[2017-01-19 00:12:12 UTC] mrmarlboroz: It was simple highschool stuffs, ppl make fun of ppl. And phil was a perfect target. Not surprising
[2017-01-19 00:12:41 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Everything is racist Everything is sexist Everything it homophobic and you have to point it all out.....
[2017-01-19 00:12:48 UTC] gorillabaz: I know it must be hurtful some of the shit that goes on
[2017-01-19 00:12:58 UTC] donniedarksouls: @gorillabaz the problem for dsp is that there is a much more efficient way to enjoy his content now and thats tiydp
[2017-01-19 00:13:21 UTC] slashingtomcat: I dont thing anyone was provoked they just thought they could capitalise on Phils rage and his mistakes
[2017-01-19 00:13:34 UTC] donniedarksouls: The only reason i watch dspgaming AND *** is that i have a relatively long attention span so i like the longer form stuff
[2017-01-19 00:14:01 UTC] gorillabaz: Yeah more refined versions of Phils video is that *** are?
[2017-01-19 00:14:07 UTC] donniedarksouls: @slashingtomcat have you seen fan ridicule?
[2017-01-19 00:14:32 UTC] slashingtomcat: where dsp ridicules fans or fans ridicule him
[2017-01-19 00:14:42 UTC] slashingtomcat: i've seen both anyway
[2017-01-19 00:15:02 UTC] donniedarksouls: There are quite a few occasions where phil has been needlessly course and interacted badly with fans, people dont like that so they react
[2017-01-19 00:15:05 UTC] gorillabaz: As bad as that fan ridicule was it certainly had a certain market
[2017-01-19 00:15:13 UTC] donniedarksouls: @slashingtomcat where dsp ridicules people whove sent him friend requests
[2017-01-19 00:15:19 UTC] gorillabaz: It wasn't for everyone
[2017-01-19 00:15:27 UTC] skysands2017: @DarksydeGeoff Agree. This is just retarded. I made a video about Phil having trouble with Mirror Knight in Dark SOuls 2, it reached more than 100,000 views. I then unlisted it when I saw how retarded people are. Yeah I made that video for fun, but not to hate on Phil. Comments were just rude.
[2017-01-19 00:15:28 UTC] donniedarksouls: Freind request ridicule rather
[2017-01-19 00:16:54 UTC] donniedarksouls: @skysands2017 thats the way people are, essentially animals, complaining about it will not fix phils problem or stop people being disgusting
[2017-01-19 00:17:04 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I don't get the whole fixation over a let's player anyways
[2017-01-19 00:17:09 UTC] gorillabaz: It was mostly kids sending Phil friend requests if I rightly remember
[2017-01-19 00:17:25 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: he don't hold any political or religious views that are controversial that i know
[2017-01-19 00:17:32 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: he plays games on the internt
[2017-01-19 00:17:34 UTC] donniedarksouls: @mr_vidar_viking you're a mod for one
[2017-01-19 00:17:35 UTC] gorillabaz: So why don't you play more games yourself mr Viking
[2017-01-19 00:17:59 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: i play a lot of games
[2017-01-19 00:18:31 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: but if you focus on hating soeone, them playing games in a fashion you don't like is not a legitimate reaosn
[2017-01-19 00:18:47 UTC] mrmarlboroz: The hate accumulated overtime, and phil did nothing about it. Now its harder than ever to do something abt it.
[2017-01-19 00:18:50 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: when there are so many other let's players you can just find one that does it right
[2017-01-19 00:18:54 UTC] gorillabaz: I like watching lets plays to get tips on how to play game myself or to get an idea if I would find a game worth buying
[2017-01-19 00:19:52 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I watch them to be enteratined
[2017-01-19 00:19:54 UTC] donniedarksouls: What about if they treat people poorly? Focusing in hating a lets player doesnt really have any legitimate basis. But its obvious why the hates there
[2017-01-19 00:20:07 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: no it isn't
[2017-01-19 00:20:20 UTC] donniedarksouls: Expand
[2017-01-19 00:20:23 UTC] donniedarksouls: Why isnt it
[2017-01-19 00:20:36 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: if you don't like the way he treat fans, don't be a fan-
[2017-01-19 00:20:39 UTC] gorillabaz: You know what I miss from Lets plays - the one where there's no commentary, just the game itself. no fucking about
[2017-01-19 00:20:45 UTC] donniedarksouls: To me its obvious, just compare him to other youtubers
[2017-01-19 00:21:01 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: If you don't like the smoke in the bakery. get the fuck out of the bakery
[2017-01-19 00:21:14 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: don't stay in the smoke complaining
[2017-01-19 00:21:20 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: it's fucking ridiculous
[2017-01-19 00:21:24 UTC] gorillabaz: Well mr viking there no smoke without fire eh?
[2017-01-19 00:21:32 UTC] gorillabaz: That could be applied to Phil
[2017-01-19 00:21:42 UTC] skysands2017: I think Phil has the best gaming channel on YouTube. Pure blind playthroughs, better than most channels.
[2017-01-19 00:21:51 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Thre is no bakery without phil either
[2017-01-19 00:21:58 UTC] donniedarksouls: @mr_vidar_viking ok maybe in a perfect world but thats not how people react, sections of us become haters, and if you cant recognise that human phenomena you're being dishonest
[2017-01-19 00:22:02 UTC] skysands2017: If you don't enjoy his content, you don't have to watch
[2017-01-19 00:22:22 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: phil is also a human phenomena,
[2017-01-19 00:22:41 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: what it is, and i will tell you what it is
[2017-01-19 00:22:48 UTC] gorillabaz: I hate when people say if you dont like it then dont watch - you have to watch first to see if you will enjoyed surely
[2017-01-19 00:22:51 UTC] renaofnight: phil attracts interesting people, that's for sure
[2017-01-19 00:22:53 UTC] donniedarksouls: Yh im not telling you its acceptable
[2017-01-19 00:23:24 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: what is happening is deindiviuation, people being anonymous and not being accountable for what they are doing
[2017-01-19 00:23:24 UTC] donniedarksouls: But based on my understanding of humans the causality is obvious
[2017-01-19 00:23:53 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @gorillabaz Except most of Phil's detractors already know whatche's about, lol.
[2017-01-19 00:24:01 UTC] lemonplaysgames: So that phrase works perfectly well here.
[2017-01-19 00:24:12 UTC] gorillabaz: People have a right to privacy if their not running a public facing business I'm afraid
[2017-01-19 00:24:24 UTC] donniedarksouls: What i find irritating in these situations is that you're laser focused on your "dont have to watch" argument without recognising the reality of the situation
[2017-01-19 00:24:35 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Hate attracts ppl, just like trump, just like that black actress in new ghostbuster. Whats new?
[2017-01-19 00:24:44 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: no matter what you do you have a right to privasy
[2017-01-19 00:24:50 UTC] gorillabaz: Many people find Phil interesting for very different reasons that you do Lemon
[2017-01-19 00:24:51 UTC] donniedarksouls: Haters exist, and they exist for a reason regardless of morality
[2017-01-19 00:25:33 UTC] donniedarksouls: No one had a right to anything, rights are flyid based on the situation
[2017-01-19 00:25:36 UTC] donniedarksouls: Has*
[2017-01-19 00:25:40 UTC] lemonplaysgames: You'd think by now if you hate him so much, why continue to surround yourself with him? There shouldn't be any other reason other than being obsessive.
[2017-01-19 00:26:10 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: being obsessive is just the start of it. some peopel are being really gross altso
[2017-01-19 00:26:21 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Or dislike him, I'm sure youll correct me on hate.
[2017-01-19 00:26:24 UTC] donniedarksouls: * no one has a right to anything, rights are fluid based on the situation
[2017-01-19 00:26:34 UTC] donniedarksouls: @lemonplaysgames are you talking to me?
[2017-01-19 00:26:35 UTC] poopoocachoomrsrobinson: I mean to be fair people who hate him surround himself with them because he's so fun to laugh at
[2017-01-19 00:26:44 UTC] lemonplaysgames: No donnie.
[2017-01-19 00:26:53 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: sentences are just words put together also donniedarksoul
[2017-01-19 00:27:08 UTC] gorillabaz: Maybe theres a number of people of who don't hate him but at the same time don;t think he's a paragon of virtue. they just find him interesting
[2017-01-19 00:27:29 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: same I just find him interesting
[2017-01-19 00:27:33 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: laugh all you want. if people would just laugh of phil it woldn't be a problem
[2017-01-19 00:27:35 UTC] donniedarksouls: @mr_vidar_viking what?
[2017-01-19 00:27:41 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @poopoocachoomrsrobinson That's something kids do. If you're a full grown man and are still being obsessive, then it becomes an issue.
[2017-01-19 00:27:48 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I dont wish ill will on the guy just, its funny to watch phil rage
[2017-01-19 00:28:05 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: the thing is that it's internet tough guys fueling their own egos on phils missery
[2017-01-19 00:28:16 UTC] gorillabaz: Lets face it he does do plenty of stuff that could be construed as funny at the very least on a regular basis
[2017-01-19 00:28:27 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: he sure does
[2017-01-19 00:28:41 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: reality check the whole world is tough guys fueling their egos on other people misery
[2017-01-19 00:28:53 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: nope
[2017-01-19 00:28:59 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: Hatred is easy, understanding and emphaty takes effort.
[2017-01-19 00:29:04 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I have tried this internet hate myself
[2017-01-19 00:29:08 UTC] gorillabaz: Its also fair to say that he not everyone's cup of tea
[2017-01-19 00:29:13 UTC] poopoocachoomrsrobinson: @LemonPlaysGames I'm not talking to a point of being obsessive, it's like watching a TV show, just put on a this is how you don't play and make fun of a guy, maybe surround was a bad phrase
[2017-01-19 00:29:24 UTC] donniedarksouls: The internet isnt any one thing, people arent any one thing, theres a spectrum in every regard. Phils interracting with a very particular section of the spectrum and if he wants less hate he needs to ask him self why.
[2017-01-19 00:29:24 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Are u trying it now?
[2017-01-19 00:29:46 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @poopoocachoomrsrobinson Fair enough.
[2017-01-19 00:30:20 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: vidar it really seems to be one or the other with you, you're either a huge fan or a huge hater thats the impression I get
[2017-01-19 00:30:31 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: a kind of you're either with me or against me kind of thing
[2017-01-19 00:30:32 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I have tried being hated on the internet myself, i was recognised, and got some infame, threats and this sort of shit. But it was only on the internet. When people can be anonymous they do vile shit. It doesn't happen to your face
[2017-01-19 00:30:48 UTC] gorillabaz: There's plenty of films I've watched that were so bad that they were good if you know what I mean
[2017-01-19 00:31:08 UTC] mrmarlboroz: So? Ur point?
[2017-01-19 00:31:34 UTC] gorillabaz: Mr Viking did that have something to do with that alleged pedo spokesman guy
[2017-01-19 00:31:41 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: This people wouldn't do what they where doing with their full real name
[2017-01-19 00:32:23 UTC] mrmarlboroz: No shit, its the internet
[2017-01-19 00:32:41 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I was not hated for being a pedo spokesman, I talked shit about my country publicly
[2017-01-19 00:32:45 UTC] lemonplaysgames: It's the people like Marle who I guess I'm referring to. If you're here just to have a good laugh, by all means.
[2017-01-19 00:32:49 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: Phils issues aren't your issues though
[2017-01-19 00:33:01 UTC] donniedarksouls: @mr_vidar_viking would you like the internet to be such that everyone knew your full name the entire time
[2017-01-19 00:33:25 UTC] gorillabaz: People want to be anonymous because they have careers outside the internet, isn't that fair enough
[2017-01-19 00:33:32 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: no, I jsut want peopel that are doing this shit are aware of what they are doing. And how it isn't nice actually.
[2017-01-19 00:33:38 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: its really crazy how people really ARE when there is no consequences
[2017-01-19 00:34:05 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I am using my own name on the internet
[2017-01-19 00:34:08 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I hve no problems
[2017-01-19 00:34:16 UTC] donniedarksouls: @mr_vidar_viking thats just not gonna happen, and none can do anything about it
[2017-01-19 00:34:17 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: but I am not a deidividuated trol leither
[2017-01-19 00:34:18 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Careers...lol. I doubt Marle has a career.
[2017-01-19 00:34:19 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yopu get it?
[2017-01-19 00:35:09 UTC] gorillabaz: Good for you mr viking but some people could lose their jobs if something happened. The internet is a fucked up place and bad things don;t just befall trolls
[2017-01-19 00:35:19 UTC] donniedarksouls: Yh ONE person doesnt have to be like that but when you're dealing with an entire population people ARE inevitably going to be like that
[2017-01-19 00:35:52 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: so whats your take on facebook then, everybody has one and its no issues
[2017-01-19 00:36:03 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I dont
[2017-01-19 00:36:16 UTC] gorillabaz: Everybody gets trolled and they don't have to be trolls or bad people to be on the receiving end of doxing or some shit
[2017-01-19 00:36:29 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: some people have legitimate reasons for being anonymous I am not saying it is wrong. I am saying it does something to the way you act towards other people
[2017-01-19 00:36:44 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: no need for it when I live in the middle of nowhere and I can lean out my window and shout a status update :P
[2017-01-19 00:36:58 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Well, give up. Its like telling internet users to stop hacking. If u tell them harshly it ll end up being provocation
[2017-01-19 00:37:02 UTC] donniedarksouls: Yh it frees up impulses
[2017-01-19 00:37:32 UTC] gorillabaz: Unfortunately the bad actors on the internet aren't going to demask themselves
[2017-01-19 00:37:38 UTC] mrmarlboroz: Ppl can be anonymous, and smart ppl will be just that
[2017-01-19 00:37:50 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: But if your reason for being anonymous is that you have to be a troll towards DSP and is legitimately afraid someone knows who you are because of the actions you did against him, maybe you should realize that you are in teh wrong
[2017-01-19 00:38:28 UTC] gorillabaz: I think we just have to agree the internet is cess pit mr viking
[2017-01-19 00:38:29 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: that something you are doing isn't exactly the nice thing to do
[2017-01-19 00:38:40 UTC] donniedarksouls: Why are you his mod exactly?
[2017-01-19 00:39:12 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: because I genuinely like phil, and the entertainement he provides
[2017-01-19 00:39:25 UTC] thesaurusboy: thats something a detractor would say
[2017-01-19 00:39:38 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: a fan also
[2017-01-19 00:39:40 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: Ok so you vidar see this hate against phil as something that needs to be fought against?
[2017-01-19 00:40:10 UTC] mrmarlboroz: U sound like a saint trying to tell highschoolers not to make fun of others. Good luck with that
[2017-01-19 00:40:13 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yes
[2017-01-19 00:40:27 UTC] thesaurusboy: how goes the fight?
[2017-01-19 00:40:28 UTC] gorillabaz: Mr Viking have you ever wondered why Phil gets a disproportionately high amount of trolls/detractors even compared with similar sized you tubers?
[2017-01-19 00:40:41 UTC] thedoctor5437: oh shit @mr_vidar_viking someone just called u out on the forums, in "Congrats on Your Third Playthrough Of Dark Souls" they complained about u timing them out
[2017-01-19 00:40:47 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: This isn't battle royal lol people don't need to be killing echother just becaust their in highschool
[2017-01-19 00:40:48 UTC] donniedarksouls: Tbh phil needs an entirely new plan for this to work long term
[2017-01-19 00:41:02 UTC] donniedarksouls: The hate market he thrived on before is being taken away from him
[2017-01-19 00:41:10 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: Vidar you would sooner drain the Fjørds of Norway with a straw than change a trolls mind on the internet
[2017-01-19 00:41:13 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: they can complain all they want
[2017-01-19 00:41:13 UTC] thesaurusboy: i think twitch is really good for him
[2017-01-19 00:41:20 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: especially on this scale with this hivemind mindset
[2017-01-19 00:41:25 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: if 10 minutes without a chat priveldge is a problem they have issues
[2017-01-19 00:41:29 UTC] thesaurusboy: the trolls give him more power tho lol
[2017-01-19 00:41:51 UTC] skysands2017: This whole "hate" is just hopping on the bandwagon. People who hate Phil just hate him because they saw some videos bashing Phil.
[2017-01-19 00:42:02 UTC] thesaurusboy: if dsp had no trolls idk if hed still be doing wht he doing
[2017-01-19 00:42:08 UTC] gorillabaz: I know its been said before but he needs to start providing edited content as the detractor videos are routinely getting more view that his raw playthroughs
[2017-01-19 00:42:12 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I have genuinely not seen what people say they hate in phil
[2017-01-19 00:42:33 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: pretty much, people like to feel part of a group
[2017-01-19 00:42:36 UTC] renaofnight: if people follow the rules as they are, then wouldn't a time out be unnecessary? just saying
[2017-01-19 00:42:38 UTC] thesaurusboy: i see it but i dont think its a reason to hate him
[2017-01-19 00:42:39 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: some of the dogmas sorrunding him is totally made up
[2017-01-19 00:42:47 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: And I mean, love em or hate em "that group" did do a lot of good for charity
[2017-01-19 00:43:36 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I am not saying everyone in the detractor communtiy is bad
[2017-01-19 00:43:38 UTC] thesaurusboy: well sons of kojima kinda sucks
[2017-01-19 00:43:50 UTC] thesaurusboy: theyre bad at detracting lol
[2017-01-19 00:43:56 UTC] gorillabaz: I imagine Phils worst haters are the ones that witness him from the start of his youtube career
[2017-01-19 00:44:03 UTC] thesaurusboy: yes
[2017-01-19 00:44:05 UTC] skysands2017: SoK are retards. Having seen a pathetic group like that.
[2017-01-19 00:44:05 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Most of them are very nice as individuals, but as a group they can do things that are a bit fucke up
[2017-01-19 00:44:21 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I dont much care for the podcast how anyone could be bothered rendering a 12 hour video of fail montages but thats their time not mine
[2017-01-19 00:44:25 UTC] skysands2017: Havn't*
[2017-01-19 00:44:31 UTC] mrmarlboroz: U sure? I ve seen some that could bring hate
[2017-01-19 00:44:45 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: not really
[2017-01-19 00:45:04 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: A healthy human being wouldn't waste their time or energy on hating a random guy on the internet. You have to have som issues if you go down that road. And I think there is alot of these on the internet. Other may hate because its the cool thing to do, basically a herd mentality, we are sheep.
[2017-01-19 00:45:14 UTC] thesaurusboy: i am a fan of dsp but i also like making fun of him i dont think theres anything wrong with that. you dont have to be a fan or a detractor when u look at it correctly his detractors and fans of that content are dsp fans lol
[2017-01-19 00:45:20 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: right mulayim
[2017-01-19 00:45:31 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: they aren't exactly organized
[2017-01-19 00:45:39 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: fred isn't this evil kingpin
[2017-01-19 00:45:46 UTC] thesaurusboy: hes a fatty
[2017-01-19 00:45:59 UTC] gorillabaz: It can spent the same amount of time hating on someone on the internet as it does to enjoy their content. theres no issues
[2017-01-19 00:46:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: no i actually like fred to be honest
[2017-01-19 00:46:10 UTC] thesaurusboy: i agree
[2017-01-19 00:46:16 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: anyone can do any action and stick an SOK flag on it
[2017-01-19 00:46:32 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: ask if you can go on the podcast then
[2017-01-19 00:46:39 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I think you'd do better than sammy did :P
[2017-01-19 00:46:52 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I think anyone would do better then him sadly
[2017-01-19 00:46:56 UTC] thesaurusboy: i liked sok for a little but i find myself not enjoying what they do so much any more
[2017-01-19 00:46:58 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: genuinely, and not just because you couldn't do worse
[2017-01-19 00:47:32 UTC] gorillabaz: I think the SOK thing is good exposure for Phil I know he won't agree with that but he should just let it roll off his back like a duch
[2017-01-19 00:47:43 UTC] thesaurusboy: yes
[2017-01-19 00:47:58 UTC] thesaurusboy: he should encourage detractors to play with him because he is the king of hate after all
[2017-01-19 00:48:03 UTC] thesaurusboy: like when he played wow
[2017-01-19 00:48:19 UTC] thesaurusboy: he coulda just played w the trolls he basically had an army who eventually would have helped him
[2017-01-19 00:48:33 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: make your weakkness your strength
[2017-01-19 00:48:39 UTC] gorillabaz: I actually wonder how much more badly he would be doing if there wasn't all this attention around him - good or bad
[2017-01-19 00:48:51 UTC] thesaurusboy: its def helping him out
[2017-01-19 00:48:56 UTC] thesaurusboy: i bought the soap man lol
[2017-01-19 00:49:00 UTC] thesaurusboy: and its good
[2017-01-19 00:49:01 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: There are always two sides to a story.
[2017-01-19 00:49:05 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yea me to
[2017-01-19 00:49:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: the soap is excellent

[2017-01-19 00:49:35 UTC] mrmarlboroz: I found dsp bcos of mgs3 ***
[2017-01-19 00:49:39 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I wouldn't have heard of him if it wasn't fail montages and for a while I thought the montage maker was actually the player
[2017-01-19 00:49:40 UTC] thesaurusboy: its cheap lol and functional
[2017-01-19 00:49:49 UTC] gorillabaz: But did you but the DSP g-string back in the Viking
[2017-01-19 00:49:59 UTC] thesaurusboy: hahaha

[2017-01-19 00:50:47 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I had some shirts printed with my self on it and that was cool
[2017-01-19 00:50:49 UTC] gorillabaz: So you didn't but the Hate Army shirt then
[2017-01-19 00:51:08 UTC] thesaurusboy: id wear a shirt with me on it
[2017-01-19 00:51:09 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I dont like being somebody's billboard for advertising everyone from phil to calvin klein tho
[2017-01-19 00:51:11 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: :P
[2017-01-19 00:51:13 UTC] gorillabaz: So your not a Sammy tier fan
[2017-01-19 00:51:30 UTC] thesaurusboy: i love samosa
[2017-01-19 00:51:32 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: no if it was a slogan or something It would be fine.
[2017-01-19 00:51:38 UTC] thesaurusboy: hes nutzo
[2017-01-19 00:52:05 UTC] gorillabaz: Is he a legit fan or is he taking the piss?
[2017-01-19 00:52:16 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: no one knows for sure
[2017-01-19 00:52:36 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I suspekt he is who he is,
[2017-01-19 00:52:55 UTC] gorillabaz: I'm inclined to think he is but something just isn't right with his antics
[2017-01-19 00:53:22 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: he's an odd one alright
[2017-01-19 00:53:30 UTC] thesaurusboy: hes real
[2017-01-19 00:53:51 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yea he is real but just not doing it right i think you can say
[2017-01-19 00:53:54 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I don't think anyone could be that stupid and I dont think he's that smart to fake it
[2017-01-19 00:54:01 UTC] gorillabaz: I don't like to think of people as proper sycophants
[2017-01-19 00:54:09 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: so I don't quite know what to think of his online antics at least
[2017-01-19 00:54:30 UTC] thesaurusboy: you just a bitch ass niqua
[2017-01-19 00:54:37 UTC] thesaurusboy: -sammy

[2017-01-19 00:55:44 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: he did? how did T react to that??
[2017-01-19 00:55:49 UTC] gorillabaz: As long as he doesn't starting hurting anyone that is
[2017-01-19 00:55:55 UTC] thesaurusboy: he just burshed it off
[2017-01-19 00:56:06 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I actually enjoy racist humor. But calling a black guy nigga to his face I mean that is just dumb
[2017-01-19 00:56:31 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I don't see the humor in it.
[2017-01-19 00:56:32 UTC] thesaurusboy: samosa challenged him to a debate and tevin said it wasnt worth his time and that was it
[2017-01-19 00:57:06 UTC] thesaurusboy: idk if i can post links here but its just his response to tevin its really funny
[2017-01-19 00:57:23 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I believe you
[2017-01-19 00:57:24 UTC] gorillabaz: I not sure why Tevin illicits that sort of vitrol cause he at least one the more respectful detractirs
[2017-01-19 00:57:37 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: Rule 6 no links
[2017-01-19 00:57:37 UTC] darksydegeoff: :)
[2017-01-19 00:57:50 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: he sure is, he also subscribes to DSP
[2017-01-19 00:58:00 UTC] gorillabaz: He doesn't straight out curse out Phil or anything
[2017-01-19 00:58:08 UTC] thesaurusboy: hes got a few screws loose but what are ya gonna do lol
[2017-01-19 00:58:11 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I don't really have anything against tevin other than he is so low energy and boring
[2017-01-19 00:58:50 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: good for background noise I have his vids on when I do other things sometimes
[2017-01-19 00:58:59 UTC] thesaurusboy: youre a lot cooler than i thought youd be vidar
[2017-01-19 00:59:02 UTC] gorillabaz: I think he points out of Phils flaws in a reasoned manner that might be what it is
[2017-01-19 00:59:04 UTC] thesaurusboy: respect
[2017-01-19 00:59:36 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah if your think is to look at a 3 hour video about phils video of a really low evergy guy
[2017-01-19 00:59:40 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: it is fien
[2017-01-19 01:00:07 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: no just the audio, tevin pretty much does a podcast to a phil video
[2017-01-19 01:00:21 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: he could switch to soundcloud and I dont think many of his fans would mind
[2017-01-19 01:00:24 UTC] gorillabaz: Phil is just an interesting guy for a number of different reasons to many people
[2017-01-19 01:00:37 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I can see that
[2017-01-19 01:01:21 UTC] thesaurusboy: mywhole thing is, i find myself laughing at things dsp does more thn his actuall jokes but i really cant get enough of him ether way
[2017-01-19 01:01:28 UTC] gorillabaz: You Mr Viking seem to think he is the second coming whilst others think he could do with gaining some self awareness
[2017-01-19 01:01:48 UTC] gorillabaz: And its all interesting
[2017-01-19 01:02:03 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: the thing is, I found phil through trolling really
[2017-01-19 01:02:42 UTC] gorillabaz: And were you inspire to defend him or what happened?
[2017-01-19 01:02:52 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I saw one of Mr.metokrs streams phil was playing starwarsa battlefront, and jim talked shit over his gamplay
[2017-01-19 01:03:25 UTC] gorillabaz: I found that video funny but that doesn't mean I hate Phil
[2017-01-19 01:03:32 UTC] darksydegeoff: I'm just glad Phil was legit about having a little conversation with me
[2017-01-19 01:03:34 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I watched his FO3 pt first, kinda forgot about his channel I was only interested in FO3 at the time
[2017-01-19 01:03:48 UTC] darksydegeoff: That's a lot better than how things were like 6 years ago
[2017-01-19 01:03:50 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: then re-discovered through trolling vids
[2017-01-19 01:04:10 UTC] gorillabaz: Any plans for future collabs beween DSG adn DSP?
[2017-01-19 01:04:28 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: In the beginning watching phil it was purely through detractor videos.
[2017-01-19 01:05:05 UTC] thesaurusboy: interesting
[2017-01-19 01:05:16 UTC] gorillabaz: Viking that goes to show that something good did come out of a detractor vid then?
[2017-01-19 01:05:27 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: It realyl was funny stuff I won't lie. But what i also discovered was that, in spite of people being gratefull for the entertainement phil was providing they hate him for it
[2017-01-19 01:05:37 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I didn't feel that was right at all.
[2017-01-19 01:06:02 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: he brings you this fucking awesome entertainement and you go around hating him like wtf,
[2017-01-19 01:06:30 UTC] gorillabaz: Maybe Phil needs to learn to laugh at himself, some self deprecation
[2017-01-19 01:06:53 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I think he does that.
[2017-01-19 01:06:54 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: Remember its not just the failing at games people dislike him for
[2017-01-19 01:06:56 UTC] thesaurusboy: he does
[2017-01-19 01:07:21 UTC] thesaurusboy: i mean if it were u being criticized all the time u may be less willing to accept it and laugh too
[2017-01-19 01:07:50 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I just think people when jumping on the hate bandwagon looses the ability to see the irony in the stuff that he does, and take everythign he does littarary
[2017-01-19 01:08:02 UTC] thesaurusboy: yeah agreed
[2017-01-19 01:08:10 UTC] gorillabaz: When he fails at games instead of going off on developers maybe he could just say something like ' what a dummy I am'
[2017-01-19 01:08:27 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: but it's a game developer
[2017-01-19 01:08:36 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: when did they cry becaus of what he said?
[2017-01-19 01:08:55 UTC] theonezytel: Mind if I cut in this conversation?
[2017-01-19 01:08:57 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: how can you be sure they didn't?
[2017-01-19 01:08:58 UTC] gorillabaz: Its very rarely a game bug that fucks Phil up be honest
[2017-01-19 01:09:35 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: @theonezytel as if you need our permission :P
[2017-01-19 01:09:46 UTC] gorillabaz: And even if it was wouldn't that be funny also
[2017-01-19 01:10:04 UTC] theonezytel: Well, I know it sounds silly, but I just created my account because I saw you gentlemen conversing.
[2017-01-19 01:10:16 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah imagining kojima sitting there crying cursing at phil
[2017-01-19 01:10:27 UTC] theonezytel: First of all, mad respect to viking.
[2017-01-19 01:10:55 UTC] gorillabaz: This is the second time I been on this channel, I keep missing the gameplay
[2017-01-19 01:11:13 UTC] theonezytel: I just wanted to maybe share some of my (and I will admit that it is rather limited) insight into Phils working
[2017-01-19 01:12:00 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I find that only a few people I have talked with in this commnity is irrational
[2017-01-19 01:12:31 UTC] gorillabaz: You what the worst thing is about all the hate Phil gets is that initially it came from a place from people wanting him to improve as a creator
[2017-01-19 01:12:40 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: you find that in every community hell even I can be irrational at times :P
[2017-01-19 01:12:56 UTC] theonezytel: My first contact with Phil was through a video that parodied his person. I went through there on out and discovered a lot of DIHYDP videos.
[2017-01-19 01:13:03 UTC] theonezytel: Oh yeah, no doubt about it.
[2017-01-19 01:13:42 UTC] gorillabaz: whats DIHYDP?
[2017-01-19 01:13:48 UTC] theonezytel: I think that Phils general issue is his demenaor and aditude.
[2017-01-19 01:14:03 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I think it is just a spellling mistake
[2017-01-19 01:14:04 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: replace the first D with a T and youtube it :P
[2017-01-19 01:14:11 UTC] theonezytel: Pardon, a typo. TIHYDP: This is how you don't play.
[2017-01-19 01:14:19 UTC] gorillabaz: Oh ok I see
[2017-01-19 01:14:23 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I thought that was a banned word
[2017-01-19 01:14:36 UTC] theonezytel: Basically a compilation of Phils greatest blunders.
[2017-01-19 01:14:52 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: It used to be, I think maybe the bot has taken the day offf
[2017-01-19 01:15:02 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: !twitter
[2017-01-19 01:15:02 UTC] nightbot: Follow me on Twitter! http://www.twitter.com/theycallmedsp
[2017-01-19 01:15:08 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: that one works ... ??
[2017-01-19 01:15:11 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: huh ok then :P
[2017-01-19 01:15:11 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: don't advertice it her please
[2017-01-19 01:15:21 UTC] theonezytel: Oh, sure. My mistake.
[2017-01-19 01:15:32 UTC] theonezytel: I don't know it was in effect.
[2017-01-19 01:15:42 UTC] thesaurusboy: you kow who i hate is theo videos
[2017-01-19 01:15:48 UTC] theonezytel: Yeah, I know.
[2017-01-19 01:15:54 UTC] gorillabaz: Does Phil intent to play DS2 after this?
[2017-01-19 01:16:38 UTC] theonezytel: I wanted to say that a lot of bad things has to do with how Phil aproaches things.
[2017-01-19 01:16:48 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: haha I actually think theo is funny. I saw him playing Streetfighter V and he raged just like phil
[2017-01-19 01:16:51 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: unironically
[2017-01-19 01:17:34 UTC] theonezytel: I mean, what he is doing is what everyone who play a video game in their lives have done before: failed. It is inevitable part of the game.
[2017-01-19 01:17:38 UTC] gorillabaz: Oh well it was nice speaking to you gents maybe I will catch a steam on time
[2017-01-19 01:17:58 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: One of my favorite things with DSP is that he is average.
[2017-01-19 01:18:11 UTC] theonezytel: Yeah, he definately is that.
[2017-01-19 01:18:16 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: He isn't bad at games at all. HE is just not Super MLG level
[2017-01-19 01:18:28 UTC] theonezytel: And neither am I and a lot of people. X3
[2017-01-19 01:18:33 UTC] thesaurusboy: hes kinda bad at overwatch lol
[2017-01-19 01:18:41 UTC] thesaurusboy: but he enjoys it
[2017-01-19 01:18:46 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: like most people
[2017-01-19 01:18:57 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I am pretty bad in FPS my self but i do enjoy them
[2017-01-19 01:19:05 UTC] thesaurusboy: i wish he played ranked overwath
[2017-01-19 01:19:10 UTC] theonezytel: I in fact have a friend who is super duper in fighting games that he cleans the floor with me for the majority of times.
[2017-01-19 01:19:20 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I've yet to see overwatch gamplay where I thought "fnatic should get an overwatch team and hire this person"
[2017-01-19 01:19:28 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: its a game everyone seems to suck at for some reaosn
[2017-01-19 01:19:52 UTC] thesaurusboy: oh im on a tem
[2017-01-19 01:19:55 UTC] thesaurusboy: team*
[2017-01-19 01:20:02 UTC] theonezytel: Yeah and that gave me the impression that I am just not that good with fighting games.
[2017-01-19 01:20:32 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: maye
[2017-01-19 01:20:58 UTC] theonezytel: I realized it had to do with my inability of learning combination lists, remembering the correct gamepad button imput and other problems.
[2017-01-19 01:21:20 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I broke my dreamcast because of mortal combat
[2017-01-19 01:21:26 UTC] theonezytel: I went on to realize that I am just above average when it comes to fighting games.
[2017-01-19 01:21:33 UTC] theonezytel: Oh? That's a pity.
[2017-01-19 01:21:44 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I got it fixet on the guarantee so it was fine
[2017-01-19 01:21:46 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I can only remember one combo per character for tekken games
[2017-01-19 01:22:14 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: fortunately that one series of combos can end the round quick but I'd get floor wiped if I were at evo :P
[2017-01-19 01:22:22 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: but when that fucking game cheated me I though it needed a lesson and threw the controller on it
[2017-01-19 01:22:24 UTC] thesaurusboy: from what i was saying before, theo videos gets like MAD at dsp and it's like hes trying too hard to be credible idk he annoys me
[2017-01-19 01:22:30 UTC] theonezytel: Oh Tekken, I got killed in the 5th game, and Soul Calibur 2, 3 & 4 with my friends X3
[2017-01-19 01:23:04 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah you can't be super outraged over everything DSP says
[2017-01-19 01:23:10 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: it hurts your credibility
[2017-01-19 01:23:47 UTC] thesaurusboy: i only say that cuz im watching one of his vids rn and hes nit picking everyting lol
[2017-01-19 01:23:50 UTC] theonezytel: That's the point! I can accept the fact that I lost because I am bad at the game, but Phils approach to that is very... How do I put this?... Uncaring.
[2017-01-19 01:24:37 UTC] theonezytel: And I understand that losing many times in a row is very draining and it can get a person ticked off.
[2017-01-19 01:25:03 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: IF you just look at it ironically, you think it is funny
[2017-01-19 01:25:27 UTC] theonezytel: That's the problem, I can't look at it ironically.
[2017-01-19 01:25:32 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: You know where the fault is, but the excuses is hillraious
[2017-01-19 01:25:48 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: dspNothing
[2017-01-19 01:26:24 UTC] theonezytel: You know, I get where you are coming from, but to me excuses are something that I myself don't want to do.
[2017-01-19 01:26:39 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: no one is forcing you to
[2017-01-19 01:26:48 UTC] theonezytel: And the reason is that I don't want to base my life by offering people just excuses.
[2017-01-19 01:27:00 UTC] theonezytel: I'm sorry if this is sounding annoying.
[2017-01-19 01:27:24 UTC] theonezytel: In a way I understand Phil, but I also don't have much respect for him.
[2017-01-19 01:27:31 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: your inability to excuse yourself only does something with you
[2017-01-19 01:27:43 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: haha
[2017-01-19 01:27:57 UTC] theonezytel: Because when I see him fail and lash out I see the worst of myself.
[2017-01-19 01:28:24 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: well then the worst of yourself is funny
[2017-01-19 01:28:37 UTC] theonezytel: Hahaha. Actually I do apologize to people for even the most unecessary matters. X3
[2017-01-19 01:28:43 UTC] thesaurusboy: vidar do u youtube?
[2017-01-19 01:28:47 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: sure
[2017-01-19 01:29:05 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I was a big youtuber in norway 10 years ago
[2017-01-19 01:29:40 UTC] theonezytel: Ooh.
[2017-01-19 01:30:49 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: today I don't make so much for youtube. I would like though, i just don't have any ideas that i think is funny
[2017-01-19 01:30:54 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: or would be entertaining
[2017-01-19 01:32:37 UTC] theonezytel: I just wanted to say that while I don't have any love for Phil I still don't think that I would stomach him being without any support. But that is my naivete talking.
[2017-01-19 01:32:52 UTC] theonezytel: Oh, that I can understand, vidar.
[2017-01-19 01:33:31 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yeah
[2017-01-19 01:55:35 UTC] theonezytel: Next time, hope to have another conversation.
[2017-01-19 03:11:22 UTC] darksydephil: test
[2017-01-19 03:11:55 UTC] darksydephil: test
[2017-01-19 03:11:58 UTC] darksydephil: ok great
[2017-01-19 03:12:02 UTC] darksydephil: sub badges updated, much better now
[2017-01-19 03:17:49 UTC] nerv117: dspSexy
[2017-01-19 03:38:50 UTC] darksydephil: yeah that new glow looks a lot better on the smaller badges
[2017-01-19 19:28:39 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I have an interesting idea on how Phil can get more interest in people pledging....not sure how well it'll be received though
[2017-01-19 19:29:18 UTC] nerv117: dspSexy
[2017-01-19 19:30:48 UTC] kingjadvcmp: nerv, what do you think of this: what if Phil shows people exactly the situation he is in, by publishing his tax returns? That way, people can physically see the situation Phil is in with his finances, and just how bad he says it is. People might be more inclined to help out. Thoughts?
[2017-01-19 19:35:00 UTC] nerv117: i personally dont really care about his taxes or bills, its not my business personally I feel he overshares anyway if certain people would want that idk if he legally should post something like that, if people are supporting him just to show support thats how it should stay. I think he just needs to think tank some reachable goals to entice more support.
[2017-01-19 19:36:38 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well nerv you could argue you donate whatever you can, because Phil has already exposed to you his dire financial situation he's in - you are compelled to act, and fair enough. But for those fans on the fence - wouldn't more evidence to encourage them to dig deep be helpful? (btw I do agree with you on Phil sharing way too much of his life online but he's happy doing that it seems)
[2017-01-19 19:37:45 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I assume legally there's no real issues, hell people demanding Trump to release his tax records lol
[2017-01-19 19:38:57 UTC] nerv117: maybe not material goals but goals that bring out more interaction with fans, he feels his viewership on twitch is whatever but if the viewership increases so does his mindshare of dsp, and encourages more to sub and such. face cam seems to really be driving a few hundered more live attendees tbh.
[2017-01-19 19:39:51 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well he said other night the view count isn't a factor, I'm glad to see you disagree - obviously the more viewers, the better chances of making some of them turn into subs, and gain fans. To just completely dismiss viewership was a bit naive IMO
[2017-01-19 19:40:02 UTC] nerv117: lol at trump taxes demands
[2017-01-19 19:42:20 UTC] bethe2670: the only reason people have been watching phils streams recently has NOTHING to do with face cam at all, the REAL reason is because he was playing dark souls and people love to see phil rage and have a hard time
[2017-01-19 19:42:45 UTC] nerv117: personally on his schedules he posts on twitter hes done it for patreon related stuff but big titles he should also advertise on that word document with a picture.
[2017-01-19 19:42:56 UTC] kingjadvcmp: the tax thing was just an idea I hadn't seen anyone else say yet, but I just thought that if Phil literally was able to show everyone and go "here, look at how much I need your help", I feel it'd be a bit of a powerful motivator to turn those undecided pledgees into patrons.
[2017-01-19 19:43:15 UTC] kingjadvcmp: also hi bethe
[2017-01-19 19:43:21 UTC] bethe2670: hello
[2017-01-19 19:43:40 UTC] nerv117: I agree and disagree @bethe2670 I really do think face cam increases his viewership in some fashion it would be more apparent on other types of content.
[2017-01-19 19:44:01 UTC] bethe2670: he shouldn't put bank info or anything like that online
[2017-01-19 19:44:08 UTC] kingjadvcmp: obviously not his bank details
[2017-01-19 19:44:13 UTC] kingjadvcmp: that'd be absurd
[2017-01-19 19:44:19 UTC] nerv117: theres a reason for that because people like seeing another human instead of just audio
[2017-01-19 19:45:03 UTC] bethe2670: but phils commentary is the point of this right
[2017-01-19 19:45:16 UTC] nerv117: yes one of the points
[2017-01-19 19:45:28 UTC] nerv117: but commentary is enhanced with facial reactions
[2017-01-19 19:45:48 UTC] kingjadvcmp: the twitch emotes don't lie
[2017-01-19 19:46:03 UTC] bethe2670: phil never does face cam except for special events or dark souls/bloodborne games
[2017-01-19 19:46:13 UTC] bethe2670: i dont think that would change
[2017-01-19 19:46:49 UTC] bethe2670: dspSexy dspGlitch dspWowdude dspNothing dspHmm dspCowboy dspAngrydsp dspSurpriseddsp dspSurpriseddsp
[2017-01-19 19:46:49 UTC] nightbot: bethe2670 -> Please do not spam emotes, thanks. [warning]
[2017-01-19 19:46:57 UTC] bethe2670: them
[2017-01-19 19:46:59 UTC] nerv117: its just an idea to play around with lol
[2017-01-19 19:47:04 UTC] bethe2670: anyway
[2017-01-19 19:47:07 UTC] nerv117: that logan trailer 2 is out
[2017-01-19 19:47:08 UTC] bethe2670: damn nightbot
[2017-01-19 19:47:12 UTC] nerv117: looks great
[2017-01-19 19:47:49 UTC] kingjadvcmp: facecam is only probably good for Phil if you are expecting him to be reacting a lot to a game. This game...let's be honest he seems a bit bored at times, cos it's easy mode for a fair bit cos of the weapons and stuff
[2017-01-19 19:47:51 UTC] blue_blur64: Nice, bethe got smited by the bot again Kappa
[2017-01-19 19:48:03 UTC] kingjadvcmp: the facecam for the Crash stuff was solid, lots of reactions
[2017-01-19 19:48:10 UTC] bethe2670: cahman man
[2017-01-19 19:48:28 UTC] nerv117: i totally agree @KingjadVCMP
[2017-01-19 19:48:35 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh yeah, he should definitely have the facecam on if he plays the Crash Remastered trilogy
[2017-01-19 19:48:38 UTC] bethe2670: crash is one of those games where you die a lot and need a death counter or something for
[2017-01-19 19:48:58 UTC] nerv117: like a walking dead telltale game would be boring as fuck for a facecam lol
[2017-01-19 19:49:32 UTC] nerv117: however if its action packed, or scary dspSexy
[2017-01-19 19:49:43 UTC] bethe2670: yeah
[2017-01-19 19:50:01 UTC] bethe2670: i just dont want him ending up like PEWDIEFUCK
[2017-01-19 19:50:38 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I've never watched pewdiepie, which is why I don't have much of an opinion on him
[2017-01-19 19:50:49 UTC] blue_blur64: same here
[2017-01-19 19:51:01 UTC] nerv117: he just yells like an idiot doing fake reactions
[2017-01-19 19:51:06 UTC] kingjadvcmp: never saw the appeal, but I respect how well they've done on YouTube.
[2017-01-19 19:51:13 UTC] bethe2670: he just does facecam for everything
[2017-01-19 19:51:25 UTC] kingjadvcmp: yeah Phil would NEVER fake reactions. BTW I really like the Duck Tales game...
[2017-01-19 19:51:49 UTC] nerv117: faking reactions for a joke is 1 thing but constantly doing it is another
[2017-01-19 19:51:54 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, it's good for the bigger channels, but I barely watch any of them tbh
[2017-01-19 19:52:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: "oh look an illusory wall" KingjadVCMP :P
[2017-01-19 19:52:35 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I think viking had (yet again) silenced me for that section
[2017-01-19 19:53:02 UTC] kingjadvcmp: anyways, if others missed it, I had an idea for Phil to get interest in more people pledging
[2017-01-19 19:53:20 UTC] theycallmejimbob: what is it King?
[2017-01-19 19:53:20 UTC] bethe2670: anyway ZELDA HYPE, today is going to be 1million times better than the past few weeks because NO DARK SOULS
[2017-01-19 19:53:24 UTC] kingjadvcmp: what if Phil shows people exactly the situation he is in, by publishing his tax returns? That way, people can physically see the situation Phil is in with his finances, and just how bad he says it is. People might be more inclined to help out. Thoughts?
[2017-01-19 19:53:40 UTC] donniedarksouls: Is he streaming today?
[2017-01-19 19:53:43 UTC] bethe2670: yes
[2017-01-19 19:53:45 UTC] kingjadvcmp: aye he is
[2017-01-19 19:53:46 UTC] bethe2670: ZELDA
[2017-01-19 19:54:18 UTC] donniedarksouls: Ah zelda eh
[2017-01-19 19:54:45 UTC] donniedarksouls: Should be some fuck ups hoefully
[2017-01-19 19:54:48 UTC] bethe2670: only game he has to play before resi 7 next week
[2017-01-19 19:54:55 UTC] nerv117: forest temple hype dspSexy
[2017-01-19 19:54:57 UTC] theycallmejimbob: so you reckon if they have physical proof rather than what Phil is saying they'd be more inclined to pledge King?
[2017-01-19 19:55:03 UTC] blue_blur64: Eh, I don't think that's our business to know, King. It's not like being president of the country where that's important information to know.
[2017-01-19 19:55:08 UTC] bethe2670: i think he was going to the forest temple or the water one
[2017-01-19 19:55:16 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well I think it'd help those on the fence be more inclined to donate
[2017-01-19 19:55:34 UTC] bethe2670: im with mr blur there
[2017-01-19 19:55:36 UTC] bethe2670: :P
[2017-01-19 19:55:44 UTC] nerv117: yup
[2017-01-19 19:56:11 UTC] darksydephil: LOL are you silly or what
[2017-01-19 19:56:15 UTC] darksydephil: publish my tax returns??
[2017-01-19 19:56:25 UTC] nerv117: dspSexy lmao
[2017-01-19 19:56:26 UTC] kingjadvcmp: it's just a thought, to encourage those on the fence lol
[2017-01-19 19:56:27 UTC] darksydephil: yes, make even more info public about me so it can be used against me. bc they dont do that enough
[2017-01-19 19:56:47 UTC] bethe2670: i knew phil wouldnt like that idea
[2017-01-19 19:56:53 UTC] bethe2670: thats why i was against it
[2017-01-19 19:57:04 UTC] nerv117: because there shouldnt be that much transparency lol
[2017-01-19 19:57:05 UTC] nuclear_armed_hogs: alright alright alright, hows it going errbody?
[2017-01-19 19:57:11 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well wouldn't the tax returns show people who doubt you just how fucked you are? I just thought it was an idea, was all, to encourage those fans on the fence that yes, they actually should do it, because look at those numbers lol.
[2017-01-19 19:57:15 UTC] bethe2670: but anyway FOREST OR WATER TEMPLE ZELDA HYPE
[2017-01-19 19:57:19 UTC] kingjadvcmp: it's your call of course, was just a thought
[2017-01-19 19:57:22 UTC] blue_blur64: Goddamnit! Watching ads for bits is still broken for me D:
[2017-01-19 19:57:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey nuclear_armed_hogs or Andre 3000
[2017-01-19 19:57:45 UTC] nerv117: i think he was on his way to forest temple
