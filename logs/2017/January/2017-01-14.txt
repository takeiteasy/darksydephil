[2017-01-14 20:02:33 UTC] testicoolio: People prefer your rage phil
[2017-01-14 20:02:40 UTC] gaylordbutthump: maybe not as many random viewers interested in it? a lot of people want to hear best/worst lists
[2017-01-14 20:02:42 UTC] emnay_i_say: Should trash talk games more often then.
[2017-01-14 20:02:54 UTC] podusmonens: maybe now that you are streaming funny moments are funny as they happen, then they lose charm
[2017-01-14 20:03:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I'm glad the DS3 "I got away with it dude" moment made it on to the funniest moments :D
[2017-01-14 20:03:14 UTC] bethe2670: people like it when you say a game is a piece of shit in a fit of rage rather than ahahhahahahahahaha that was funny as fuck
[2017-01-14 20:03:18 UTC] podusmonens: lotta people trash talking games for a living

[2017-01-14 20:04:40 UTC] podusmonens: counterpoint or smth?

[2017-01-14 20:06:05 UTC] podusmonens: I got bored of avgn for al long time now. angry joe too. all the angry guys :D
[2017-01-14 20:06:11 UTC] gaylordbutthump: or maybe he just has a larger budget now to do what he wants, cause he has a huge interest in movies
[2017-01-14 20:06:27 UTC] podusmonens: now I watch people like Destiny and totalbiscuit
[2017-01-14 20:06:33 UTC] amocoru: I still enjoy AngyrJoe when he's actually doing reviews and not screwing around with movies/reactions

[2017-01-14 20:08:26 UTC] bethe2670: i'd throw my wii u in the trash if i wasnt going to get the new zelda on it lol, since that is the only game i want until mario comes out later in the year so the switch is not worth it on the 3rd of march
[2017-01-14 20:08:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey jack
[2017-01-14 20:08:54 UTC] chocorampage: hey everyone
[2017-01-14 20:08:54 UTC] jackwhite2000: so anyone here getting a switch at launch?

[2017-01-14 20:09:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: who threw the wii u in the trash?
[2017-01-14 20:09:17 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i'm not getting the switch until it has smt on it or something else good. definitely not paying for online though, i hate that trend
[2017-01-14 20:09:22 UTC] humpiershaggy: Nah, I've got no interest in Switch
[2017-01-14 20:09:32 UTC] podusmonens: inb4 the switch in the trash
[2017-01-14 20:09:32 UTC] khawaja7: yea switch has paid online sadly
[2017-01-14 20:09:41 UTC] jackwhite2000: honestly after breath of the wild im done with nintendo
[2017-01-14 20:09:44 UTC] podusmonens: what was nintendo's big reveal btw?
[2017-01-14 20:09:50 UTC] popsicolo: Phil did. I searched for several minutes to find the video of him doing it.
[2017-01-14 20:09:57 UTC] jackwhite2000: because it seems that game will be the wii us last exclusive
[2017-01-14 20:09:58 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i hate microsoft for starting that trend, although sony and nintendo are definitely to blame for continuing it
[2017-01-14 20:09:59 UTC] ciateral: Inb4 people still use that acronym.
[2017-01-14 20:10:00 UTC] ciateral: Smh
[2017-01-14 20:10:04 UTC] testicoolio: Hmm, he could have dick lightninged this
[2017-01-14 20:10:05 UTC] iconicmaster1: I'm waiting for smash 5

[2017-01-14 20:10:25 UTC] popsicolo: and then he did.
[2017-01-14 20:10:31 UTC] jackwhite2000: aka every time
[2017-01-14 20:10:41 UTC] indicansent: Sega started paid online w/ the Sega Channel. Get it legit
[2017-01-14 20:10:43 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Nintendo better have a fantastic value to end up charging their consumers to pay to play online.
[2017-01-14 20:10:47 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I was hoping to buy a wii u during the sales at the moment a 32gb premium wii u with Mario Kart 8 is 30 euro cheaper than buying a switch.
[2017-01-14 20:10:59 UTC] taurusoxford: @LemonPlaysGames spoilers ; They won't
[2017-01-14 20:11:06 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Probably.
[2017-01-14 20:11:08 UTC] jackwhite2000: also it will have a new SF 2
[2017-01-14 20:11:09 UTC] iconicmaster1: No more heroes 3
[2017-01-14 20:11:15 UTC] gnarlypotato: is this agdq stream?
[2017-01-14 20:11:17 UTC] indicansent: But there was another company (N-band I think) that did it even before Sega. There was also Sega.net on Dreamcast
[2017-01-14 20:11:17 UTC] nightbot: indicansent -> This really pisses me off! [stop posting links] [warning]
[2017-01-14 20:11:19 UTC] 1buttondash: how much better will zelda be on switch than wiiU? did they explain details?
[2017-01-14 20:11:21 UTC] gnarlypotato: are we gonna speed run dank souls?
[2017-01-14 20:11:26 UTC] jackwhite2000: for how long can capcom milk sf2
[2017-01-14 20:11:28 UTC] jackwhite2000: ?
[2017-01-14 20:11:32 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no release date for SF2 yet :(
[2017-01-14 20:11:33 UTC] taurusoxford: ANy hope or optimism I had that would change direction after the wiiU flopped has completely died
[2017-01-14 20:11:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: looking forward to seeing Phil play it
[2017-01-14 20:11:48 UTC] popsicolo: The best part of the Switch presentation was the Suda51 interpreter LUL
[2017-01-14 20:11:50 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @1buttondash I think it's a slightly higher resolution and it'll perform better.
[2017-01-14 20:11:51 UTC] indicansent: I'm posting links? Lol whatever
[2017-01-14 20:11:53 UTC] butter__my__bread: A company that has a terrible track record with online gaming wants to charge for it lmao yea.. ok Nintendo.
[2017-01-14 20:12:05 UTC] popsicolo: "Sega.net" is what did you in there
[2017-01-14 20:12:08 UTC] podusmonens: you know the console is gonna be trash when they superimpose footage on its screen in the commercial
[2017-01-14 20:12:20 UTC] 1buttondash: sega should come back out with a system
[2017-01-14 20:12:20 UTC] podusmonens: like really dood
[2017-01-14 20:12:23 UTC] jackwhite2000: i mean i know SF 2 is great but come on that game is 25 years old
[2017-01-14 20:12:24 UTC] amocoru: 32gb HD in 2017 LUL
[2017-01-14 20:12:28 UTC] iconicmaster1: Phil should play no more heroes 2 if a third one coming out for switch
[2017-01-14 20:12:30 UTC] taurusoxford: I really hope Phil doesn't waste his money on switch - he can just play Zelda on WiiU
[2017-01-14 20:12:31 UTC] indicansent: I'll just keep that in mind then Popsicolo
[2017-01-14 20:12:37 UTC] gaylordbutthump: sega's probably never gonna get back into console hardware
[2017-01-14 20:12:43 UTC] indicansent: Yes Sega should come back, but they won't
[2017-01-14 20:12:45 UTC] 1buttondash: yea i know
[2017-01-14 20:12:46 UTC] popsicolo: Another great part of the presentation was when Todd-sama showed up.
[2017-01-14 20:12:49 UTC] 1buttondash: just sayin
[2017-01-14 20:12:51 UTC] indicansent: There's no point
[2017-01-14 20:12:54 UTC] podusmonens: say-gah
[2017-01-14 20:13:00 UTC] theycallmejimbob: did they mention what size hard drive comes with the switch?
[2017-01-14 20:13:09 UTC] amocoru: 32gb
[2017-01-14 20:13:12 UTC] amocoru: Is the base model

[2017-01-14 20:24:13 UTC] impyo: o&S first try for phil i guess
[2017-01-14 20:24:13 UTC] indicansent: Yes the Switch price is too high. They'll have to lower it within a few months once sales start to dry up

[2017-01-14 20:24:17 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Jesus Chrimany.. I'm playing the PC version of Dark Souls 1 and this bonfire but has happened at least 10 times now. I leave the bonfire, but my character gets stuck and won't move. Nor will the menu work, resulting in an alt+f4.

[2017-01-14 20:25:14 UTC] zawarud00: im hyped for fire emblem warriors
[2017-01-14 20:25:20 UTC] encelor: i heard nintendo going to ship low quantity of switch to the US so the price goes up
[2017-01-14 20:25:22 UTC] indicansent: Well, console sales are great but only select AAA games move big numbers.
[2017-01-14 20:25:26 UTC] megamannt125: @Princeg103 I pre-ordered the 120$ Master Edition so I can't say I'm not bias lol
[2017-01-14 20:25:32 UTC] ash0787: I made a char during last time DSP played and got to level 35ish but having a bit of trouble with it

[2017-01-14 20:25:43 UTC] amocoru: Nintendo always ships low quantities to create artificial interest
[2017-01-14 20:25:43 UTC] indicansent: If Nintendo tries to manufacture demand it's going to ruin Switch
[2017-01-14 20:25:46 UTC] zawarud00: SMT 5 is also gonna be hpe

[2017-01-14 20:25:59 UTC] butter__my__bread: why? its just repetitive dynasty warriors with a different cast

[2017-01-14 20:26:11 UTC] megamannt125: @alex_dragonul I doubt it. At worst it'll just do decently like Gamecube
[2017-01-14 20:26:13 UTC] nerv117: not really building a pc this year was cheaper than building one in 2007

[2017-01-14 20:26:22 UTC] megamannt125: The Wii U had a lot against it
[2017-01-14 20:26:26 UTC] amocoru: I can't wait until Nintendo is no longer in the console game so devs will stop catering to underpowered shit consoles
[2017-01-14 20:26:30 UTC] podusmonens: username PC gaming is already the best npw
[2017-01-14 20:26:31 UTC] jackwhite2000: not as bad as wii u but it will fail
[2017-01-14 20:26:35 UTC] indicansent: I don't think it'll fail all around, but it'll probably do noticeably less than 3DS. Better than Wii U if they do everything right.
[2017-01-14 20:26:41 UTC] xgameofpwns: Phil, you should try 'Ni-Oh' when it comes out it's supposed to be similar to dark souls could get good views
[2017-01-14 20:26:42 UTC] megamannt125: Shit name, shit marketing, nothing substantially different from Wii besides the gamepad

[2017-01-14 20:27:08 UTC] indicansent: Issue is now they have to make up lost money with tons of software and merch sales. That's why the Joycons cost so damn much.

[2017-01-14 20:37:16 UTC] sprigsgaming: DPS Dude have you not figured out that it doesn't matter what you do they just want to make you run circles trying to figure out what they want to watch
[2017-01-14 20:37:21 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i think bandai namco is probably to blame for a lot of the stuff i don't like because they want mass market appeal for the series
[2017-01-14 20:37:21 UTC] dankedan: Never been negative?
[2017-01-14 20:37:21 UTC] blue_blur64: I still haven't beat a From Software game D:

[2017-01-14 20:38:27 UTC] gaylordbutthump: @Tepexy yeah, i doubt miyazaki had his heart into it because i'm pretty sure he's said he doesn't like doing sequels
[2017-01-14 20:38:28 UTC] butter__my__bread: s

[2017-01-14 20:45:09 UTC] tepexy: khawaja7, yeah dks3 has the best gameplay for sure, if we dont count bloodborne which just perfected it to me, best level design in in the first dark souls IMO
[2017-01-14 20:45:12 UTC] alexaponteftw: No fluff allowed SMOrc

[2017-01-14 20:45:18 UTC] oreimo33: Oh yeah SO MEANINGFUL to hear you say "I ROLLED" a million times. That's so much more meaningful than hearing an opinion about a brand new product.
[2017-01-14 20:45:23 UTC] icedragon247: U have a cold...

[2017-01-14 20:45:39 UTC] oreimo33: Go ahead and say "I DODGED" or "I DIDN'T DO THAT" a billion times. That's SO MUCH more meaningful.
[2017-01-14 20:45:39 UTC] jackwhite2000: a switch*

[2017-01-14 20:45:49 UTC] gaylordbutthump: @khawaja7 well, someone other than bamco at least. i'd say atlus but atlus doesn't do pc games or xbox, just nintendo and playstation
[2017-01-14 20:45:52 UTC] chloeiscool1992: you sound like shit go to bed and get leanna to make you tea with honey and soup :D
[2017-01-14 20:45:54 UTC] khawaja7: @Tepexy, i think of BB as a different series altogether with some similarities to souls. Different setting, different characters and different lore. But yea 1 was the best
[2017-01-14 20:45:54 UTC] akioartorius: any chance of a lost odyssey playthrough?

[2017-01-14 20:46:39 UTC] oreimo33: I'm here for that as well. But why does he pretend that this is somehow more meaningful than a reaction video to a new product? I honestly don't understand his attitude. Did a YT who did reaction videos harm him somehow?
[2017-01-14 20:46:40 UTC] peter183: guilty as charged

[2017-01-14 20:46:47 UTC] khawaja7: @gaylordbutthump, yea that would be ok but i dont think others have the experience of handling souls that namco have.. i mean their only mistake was the DkS3 launch thing
[2017-01-14 20:46:51 UTC] jackwhite2000: phil should take a senzu bean
[2017-01-14 20:46:53 UTC] radicalenzyme: He will beat the boss on the first try with that OP weapon

[2017-01-14 20:47:10 UTC] zawarud00: Fire emblem warriors gonna be ass if all they put is awakening and marth in it
[2017-01-14 20:47:11 UTC] akioartorius: Phil, have you tried boiled coka cola with boiled lemons? it works well with colds but not sore throats.
[2017-01-14 20:47:18 UTC] butter__my__bread: play dq8 on 3ds phil
[2017-01-14 20:47:24 UTC] oreimo33: Waiting for the meaning now, Phil. Come on, give me some of that MEANING.

[2017-01-14 20:48:27 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I think Phil's throat is infected with bacteria or something, he does need to go to the doctor
[2017-01-14 20:48:28 UTC] drilbit777: Well I'd be okay with FE musou if they went with GBA, pot/RD and awakening/fates characters
[2017-01-14 20:48:30 UTC] somone192: nothing he could do :(
[2017-01-14 20:48:30 UTC] ornightz: @zawarud00 It ain't goin to be as , they teased Crom at the end if he's in there you can bet that previous games will offer the Heroes and Villains
[2017-01-14 20:48:31 UTC] zawarud00: too bad phill hasnt evever played a FE game
[2017-01-14 20:48:35 UTC] blue_blur64: They're gonna have to get some mages and archers too though
[2017-01-14 20:48:42 UTC] drilbit777: The GBA ones need representation too
[2017-01-14 20:48:43 UTC] 1buttondash: these aint' blak nites
[2017-01-14 20:48:45 UTC] kuroriku: @bethe2670 lol youre no heel. just a troll. if you wanna be a heel you gotta step up them promos you cut.
[2017-01-14 20:48:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :D bethe2670 I wont disagree with you there
[2017-01-14 20:48:49 UTC] bethe2670: what a idiot - hermione granger
[2017-01-14 20:48:50 UTC] blue_blur64: He played Awakening before @zawarud00
[2017-01-14 20:48:53 UTC] impatient_viewer: Are you going to do the DLC as well DSP?
[2017-01-14 20:48:59 UTC] jackwhite2000: am i the only one who thinks the graphics of this game dint age well?
[2017-01-14 20:49:01 UTC] drilbit777: If they want to put any mages they should put Soren or Micah in it

[2017-01-14 20:49:10 UTC] akioartorius: He said no dlc playthrough i think
[2017-01-14 20:49:12 UTC] bartboulderdash: He said he doesn't plan on doing the DLC
[2017-01-14 20:49:13 UTC] bethe2670: i do good promos ok im not like roman reigns
[2017-01-14 20:49:14 UTC] thermocrius: He also got the best shield in the game
[2017-01-14 20:49:16 UTC] ash0787: I got one of those halberds but the stat requirements are very high

[2017-01-14 20:49:19 UTC] tepexy: jackwhite, yes, it looks good to me
[2017-01-14 20:49:23 UTC] oreimo33: So you're not even going to talk about the Switch while you play the game? Do you ever talk about anything during gameplay or do you just parrot what happens in the game as if we are blind?
[2017-01-14 20:49:36 UTC] chaosalltheway: Syf shield is da best
[2017-01-14 20:49:37 UTC] yacherdy: bethe is like Alicia Fox on promos.
[2017-01-14 20:49:38 UTC] blue_blur64: Micaiah definitely has to be in it since she was the main protagonist of Radiant Dawn
[2017-01-14 20:49:42 UTC] chloeiscool1992: can someone please clarify
[2017-01-14 20:49:43 UTC] ash0787: needs 18 dex and my guide said only use 16

[2017-01-14 20:49:56 UTC] indicansent: Yeah cmon DSP give us some thoughts on Switch. Would like to hear.

[2017-01-14 20:50:22 UTC] chloeiscool1992: but thats a fluffy video
[2017-01-14 20:50:25 UTC] billios69: maybe because they're not he same enemies
[2017-01-14 20:50:32 UTC] chloeiscool1992: he gotta do that quality content y'know
[2017-01-14 20:50:32 UTC] thermocrius: @Chaosalltheway, sort of, but it's a heavy shield. Artorias' Shield has the highest stability of 88. this shield is medium and has a stability of 76 fully upgraded
[2017-01-14 20:50:35 UTC] zawarud00: Im surprised they havent made a final fantasy musou seems like a clear money maker
[2017-01-14 20:50:37 UTC] zawarud00: like it writes itself
[2017-01-14 20:50:39 UTC] ornightz: Pretty certain the only game He'll likely get are Zelda and probably Mario
[2017-01-14 20:50:44 UTC] availableusername888: fuck dks2,bb and dks3 this game was and is the best of series
[2017-01-14 20:50:47 UTC] oreimo33: Huh? If he thinks it sucks, he could say why. If he likes it, he could say why. He could speculate whether or not it will be commercially successful or not. He could say what Nintendo should've done differently in his opinion etc.
[2017-01-14 20:50:48 UTC] akioartorius: aren't these the sliver knights not the black knights?
[2017-01-14 20:50:59 UTC] unknownnothingz: yes silver knights
[2017-01-14 20:51:00 UTC] blue_blur64: That's kind of hard to do because Square Enix is huge on protecting their IP's
[2017-01-14 20:51:06 UTC] khawaja7: pretty sure its the censnsus that DkS1 is the best souls
[2017-01-14 20:51:09 UTC] zawarud00: i made they made dragon quest musou

[2017-01-14 20:51:19 UTC] chloeiscool1992: exactly
[2017-01-14 20:51:20 UTC] indicansent: I wouldn't say it's moaning; a person can have a million reasons why they think something's good or bad. That's what we want to hear; why DSP feels Switch is good or bad, not just if he thinks it's good or bad
[2017-01-14 20:51:25 UTC] bethe2670: cheap shot lol
[2017-01-14 20:51:26 UTC] themonogordo: what is the silver coin for?

[2017-01-14 20:51:26 UTC] megamannt125: He already said it sucks because he doesn't like the gimmick or hardware
[2017-01-14 20:51:30 UTC] blue_blur64: Just look at Smash Bros 4 with Cloud's stage. They only have 2 songs in the stage
[2017-01-14 20:51:37 UTC] ash0787: I dont feel much need to move onto dark souls 2 and 3
[2017-01-14 20:51:45 UTC] khawaja7: play 3

[2017-01-14 20:52:04 UTC] ash0787: this game is classic in my opinion, similar to baldurs gate

[2017-01-14 21:04:11 UTC] liumneesun: @TaurusOxford But why? There are people who make a living solely playing Dark Souls games for instance.
[2017-01-14 21:04:12 UTC] rpgasm34: yup lol
[2017-01-14 21:04:14 UTC] tepexy: is the halberd +2 or +3? or even more`?

[2017-01-14 21:43:31 UTC] ukyo9: @zawarud00, it's not a matter of being butthurt. I genuinely wanted to see phil learn and conquer the game, but this is ludicrous. He knows it too

[2017-01-14 21:49:06 UTC] oreimo33: I'm salty about his attitude about it. Why does he have to be rude to everybody who talks about gaming news? If he doesn't want to, fine. But him insulting everybody who does it annoyed me.

[2017-01-14 21:49:50 UTC] tofty1996: @zawarud00, I have beaten it many times more than that and I know it isn't the best weapon in the game, but for a PVE run it is because you can get it early and make the early game easy as fuck, and it's fairly easy to upgrade and can be used with only a little investment in strength
[2017-01-14 21:49:52 UTC] chuckrock8419: You need more intelligence and a book to read while fighting them bosses!

[2017-01-14 21:50:08 UTC] dennisktgamergr_: @HumpierShaggy, if he had a normal weapon he would not get past this boss guranteed

[2017-01-14 21:50:13 UTC] mrfreezepunsbestpuns: i beat it first try with my zweihander +14 and lvl 80 i had on my first run

[2017-01-14 21:50:35 UTC] tofty1996: I'm not even mad that Phil got the drop because ultimately it's a random drop, I just think it makes his playthrough far less interesting
[2017-01-14 21:50:36 UTC] popsicolo: I have no idea where my copy of Bloodborne is. I'd co-op with him if he'd fight Ludwig again.
[2017-01-14 21:50:36 UTC] punishedmac: I didn't get a black knight weapon on my first playthrough in this game, but I got a black knight sword on my second run and it trivialized the whole game.
[2017-01-14 21:50:36 UTC] zawarud00: At this point he should make a Redemption MGS playthrough to show his growth

[2017-01-14 21:50:47 UTC] amineo2: I still think that Centipede Demon and Firesage will rape him a lot, because Phil tends to not like these kind of fights

[2017-01-14 21:55:00 UTC] dball3r429: There's a reason speedrunning Dark Souls necessitates the Black Knight Halberd. It's undeniably powerful, possible to obtain early on in a play-through, and is viable from when you get it, to the end of the game. Very few weapons besides the Black Knight weapons have such a reputation.
[2017-01-14 21:55:08 UTC] encelor: @jackwhite2000 he just slapped them with his weapon

[2017-01-14 22:01:54 UTC] ornightz: @Ukyo9 okay tht's great what's really the issue tht this weapon is cutting the game completion by half
[2017-01-14 22:01:56 UTC] messerscohen: thanks Gaylord

[2017-01-14 22:01:58 UTC] jeremytheboss: @bethe2670 lul *** doesnt know how to spell lul
[2017-01-14 22:02:00 UTC] bethe2670: bobbi that is bullshit and you know it, wwhat about you and mass effect
[2017-01-14 22:02:01 UTC] jackwhite2000: i hate trial and error bosses
[2017-01-14 22:02:03 UTC] wubegg: YOU DIED
[2017-01-14 22:02:04 UTC] ethershulk: the other serpent is way cooler
[2017-01-14 22:02:05 UTC] theycallmejimbob: nothing challenging left dankedan ?
[2017-01-14 22:02:10 UTC] tofty1996: @Ornightz, He knows it's a big deal but ultimately it's not his fault he got a random weapon drop and I don't blame him for using it. It's such a good weapon for a PVE run. But when classic bosses that people spent weeks trying to beat become trivial because you do 1/6th of their health in one hit, it pisses people off and makes for a boring run imo
[2017-01-14 22:02:10 UTC] punishedmac: @Messerscohen, AI rng idea for a speedrun, cheesed super smough with pillars, still used all his estus.
[2017-01-14 22:02:11 UTC] dball3r429: probably will end up with 150 deaths
[2017-01-14 22:02:18 UTC] akioartorius: so which serpent is the canon ending?
[2017-01-14 22:02:19 UTC] nerv117: theres four kings but he will tank them
[2017-01-14 22:02:23 UTC] punishedmac: ideal for a speedrun, that is
[2017-01-14 22:02:29 UTC] grind_inc: DansGame
[2017-01-14 22:02:30 UTC] bobbi_ling: mass effect has been casualized beth. go play the 1st and youll see
[2017-01-14 22:02:31 UTC] nerv117: lighting the flame is the true ending
[2017-01-14 22:02:33 UTC] shotinthedeep: UP THERE
[2017-01-14 22:02:34 UTC] encelor: why is that snake not in other darksoul games?
[2017-01-14 22:02:40 UTC] dankedan: @theycallmejimbob Well bed of chaos maybe but the others such as nito and the four kinds not really
[2017-01-14 22:02:48 UTC] akioartorius: the serpents all died kappa
[2017-01-14 22:02:49 UTC] chuckrock8419: Your learning my son very good
[2017-01-14 22:02:50 UTC] nazgorg: @Tofty1996 im not bored
[2017-01-14 22:02:54 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: The moment when the haters actually start to make "this is how you play" series instead
[2017-01-14 22:02:55 UTC] dankedan: Kings*
[2017-01-14 22:02:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: ah I see ty for the answer dankedan
[2017-01-14 22:02:57 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: andromeda is bringing some elements from 1 back
[2017-01-14 22:02:57 UTC] messerscohen: I think manus will be the rage boss this time
[2017-01-14 22:02:59 UTC] bethe2670: bobbi i played the first was easy just like the 2nd and 3rd and probably andromeda
[2017-01-14 22:03:01 UTC] dankedan: @theycallmejimbob Yw
[2017-01-14 22:03:01 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Bed of Chaos is just super annoying for the fact the fight wasn't finished.
[2017-01-14 22:03:04 UTC] lightweightbro: would've been less complaining if he just played Red Dead Dedemption
[2017-01-14 22:03:04 UTC] naddodr: the only way he can die from now on is from gravity
[2017-01-14 22:03:07 UTC] gaylordbutthump: he's not doing the dlc
[2017-01-14 22:03:14 UTC] akioartorius: Phil is not doing the Artorias dlc so no Manus
[2017-01-14 22:03:15 UTC] coldkiller86: wtf how thid he carry that big as hell
[2017-01-14 22:03:15 UTC] messerscohen: son of a bitch
[2017-01-14 22:03:20 UTC] seraphic17: The Kings will make you remember
[2017-01-14 22:03:20 UTC] bobbi_ling: it had deeper rpg mechanics beth
[2017-01-14 22:03:22 UTC] levinds: I mean.. if the weapon is in the game and pillars are in the boss arena, he'd be stupid not to use them..
[2017-01-14 22:03:23 UTC] tepexy: or maybe he is? if he beats the game quicklyu
[2017-01-14 22:03:23 UTC] jackwhite2000: the haters:"phil beat O&S only because he was OP,he still sucks at this game"
[2017-01-14 22:03:26 UTC] ulvenfenrir: at what part did phil quit dark souls originally?
[2017-01-14 22:03:29 UTC] availableusername888: bed of chaos was bs, but doable in few tries
[2017-01-14 22:03:29 UTC] pr34ch: wait a minite how the hell did he fit that thing in his back pocket ??
[2017-01-14 22:03:30 UTC] tofty1996: @Ornightz, Dark Souls is all about the challenge and the satisfaction of overcoming it, it's renowned as a really difficult game and I think maybe unfairly, but when you're watching this run does it ever look particularly difficult?
[2017-01-14 22:03:36 UTC] nerv117: bed of chaos is easy with the arrow cheese Kappa
[2017-01-14 22:03:43 UTC] ethershulk: kingseeker frampt is probably the canon serpent while darkstalker kathee is so mich more interesting ;/
[2017-01-14 22:03:45 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Phil, PLEASE get the DLC... :/ You must put Artorias out of his mysery.
[2017-01-14 22:03:48 UTC] chuckrock8419: Reminds me of The Lord of The Rings
[2017-01-14 22:04:00 UTC] spade137: he has the dlc
[2017-01-14 22:04:03 UTC] akioartorius: Ulvenfenrir, after he lost to quellag. pt 30 something
[2017-01-14 22:04:04 UTC] naddodr: Phil doesn't suck at the game, that's why I'm pissed he's using that weapon. he doesn't need it
[2017-01-14 22:04:10 UTC] nerv117: when did he get the dlc
[2017-01-14 22:04:11 UTC] alexaponteftw: Nose blow time?
[2017-01-14 22:04:13 UTC] somone192: is he going to do the dlc?
[2017-01-14 22:04:14 UTC] spade137: dunno if he will play it
[2017-01-14 22:04:15 UTC] bobbi_ling: the dlc sucks tbh
[2017-01-14 22:04:15 UTC] tofty1996: @Nazgorg, that's fine, not everyone will get annoyed, it's mostly people who played and love this game and want Phil to feel the heat like they did and to feel genuine satisfaction after slogging through the tough fights
[2017-01-14 22:04:17 UTC] messerscohen: did he get the dlc
[2017-01-14 22:04:20 UTC] ulvenfenrir: ok thanks akioartorius
[2017-01-14 22:04:23 UTC] jackwhite2000: @Naddodr im just saying what the haters will say
[2017-01-14 22:04:26 UTC] spookywun: this fashion is amazing PogChamp
[2017-01-14 22:04:26 UTC] dankedan: He's not playing dlc
[2017-01-14 22:04:33 UTC] chuckrock8419: All Phil needs is bare hands to complete The Task
[2017-01-14 22:04:33 UTC] messerscohen: damnit
[2017-01-14 22:04:37 UTC] tofty1996: Ok I'm done now, said my piece on the BKH
[2017-01-14 22:04:42 UTC] spade137: yea dnt think he doing dlc
[2017-01-14 22:04:47 UTC] naddodr: yeah, fuck the haters, trolls and bitches
[2017-01-14 22:04:51 UTC] ornightz: @Tofty1996 So he's doin better than what most couldn't cause they didn't get this weapon drop
[2017-01-14 22:04:55 UTC] akioartorius: so the serpents all have red eye.

[2017-01-14 22:05:02 UTC] jeremytheboss: lul people think phil is good lul but probably better than *** @bethe2670
[2017-01-14 22:05:02 UTC] ukyo9: @Ornightz, I already said it. Because there is no redemption in steamrolling. Phil is not cheating, he obtained the weapon in legit means, of course. And yet, he fully knows that it's more powerful than everything else, and yet he decided to use it.
[2017-01-14 22:05:12 UTC] jackwhite2000: how many hours is phil in the game?
[2017-01-14 22:05:13 UTC] nazgorg: @Tofty1996 maybe true but most ppl i saw were very hostile to him and gave the feeling they wanted him to fail no matter what
[2017-01-14 22:05:17 UTC] iconicmaster1: Break time
[2017-01-14 22:05:22 UTC] lostczeech: Hey
[2017-01-14 22:05:22 UTC] coldkiller86: spit him out dont know where phil have been
[2017-01-14 22:05:28 UTC] oreimo33: How did he do against Smough & Ornstein?
[2017-01-14 22:05:31 UTC] coldkiller86: could have deseases
[2017-01-14 22:05:34 UTC] somone192: did he go to the bottom where the spider boss is?
[2017-01-14 22:05:35 UTC] bethe2670: jeremytheboss is annyoing reminds me of creepy
[2017-01-14 22:05:35 UTC] bobbi_ling: go to demon ruins

[2017-01-14 22:05:40 UTC] mrhuth: just ignore the chat hand holding, the guides he got sent and this is a LEGIT run
[2017-01-14 22:05:40 UTC] akioartorius: Phil one shotted Ornstein and Smough
[2017-01-14 22:05:44 UTC] tofty1996: @Ornightz, absolutely, let's be honest Phil shows a lack of understanding of basic controls and mechanics in this game, yet he can beat one of the toughest bosses in the game first time without summons
[2017-01-14 22:05:47 UTC] psyoctopi: demon riins is bed of chaos
[2017-01-14 22:05:47 UTC] dankedan: @DarksydePhil Witch is the bed of chaos
[2017-01-14 22:05:51 UTC] messerscohen: huth lol
[2017-01-14 22:05:52 UTC] oreimo33: pffff he cannot even fail properly anymore.
[2017-01-14 22:05:53 UTC] wubegg: You're forgetting Seath the Scaless
[2017-01-14 22:05:56 UTC] humpiershaggy: Seath is in the crystal caves
[2017-01-14 22:06:03 UTC] jiv_: first people complain he gets too much help, now they complain he's not accepting help
[2017-01-14 22:06:07 UTC] chuckrock8419: Nooooo down The Eso Chamber
[2017-01-14 22:06:10 UTC] popsicolo: Witch got turned into the mother of demons for trying to artificially extend the age of fire IIRC.
[2017-01-14 22:06:11 UTC] jeremytheboss: @bethe2670 lul *** thinks im annoying but gets mad when phil doesnt suck his dick lul
[2017-01-14 22:06:12 UTC] emnay_i_say: Rip

[2017-01-14 22:06:13 UTC] somone192: did he go through blight town?
[2017-01-14 22:06:17 UTC] messerscohen: he does get too much help
[2017-01-14 22:06:23 UTC] dicklightning: that armor set though MingLee
[2017-01-14 22:06:28 UTC] bobbi_ling: phil > dark souls
[2017-01-14 22:06:29 UTC] tofty1996: @Nazgorg, I want him to succeed, just want him to get the true Dark Souls experience of getting rekt a little before you win
[2017-01-14 22:06:29 UTC] bethe2670: go to the catacombs and the tomb of the giants phil
[2017-01-14 22:06:30 UTC] jackwhite2000: @Oreimo33 how can you not fail right?
[2017-01-14 22:06:31 UTC] akioartorius: I hope Phil remembers what to do with Seath...
[2017-01-14 22:06:35 UTC] encelor: kill him
[2017-01-14 22:06:43 UTC] availableusername888: should he take skeleton route next or what was next sensible path?
[2017-01-14 22:06:45 UTC] khawaja7: oh petrus LUL
[2017-01-14 22:06:47 UTC] bethe2670: phil is good at dark souls he just been getting lucky
[2017-01-14 22:06:48 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @dankedan Nope, Bed of Chaos is a failed demon product of the Witch's attempt to duplicate the first flame. The Witch is in front of the boss door to the bed of chaos however, she's a pushover.
[2017-01-14 22:06:49 UTC] somone192: lol dicklightning fashion isnt dsps strongest suit PogChamp
[2017-01-14 22:06:49 UTC] messerscohen: people are bugged by the weapon because it's the same as overlevelling in their opinion
[2017-01-14 22:06:50 UTC] nerv117: dont worry he will blow his nose before the boss Kappa

[2017-01-14 22:07:03 UTC] bethe2670: I CANT WAIT FOR NIOH
[2017-01-14 22:07:05 UTC] punishedmac: I dunno, the fact he's died 120 times with the BKH just after O&S is a feat in itself
[2017-01-14 22:07:06 UTC] dball3r429: well yeah grinding is part of the souls series

[2017-01-14 22:07:22 UTC] jayjay2477: nice play dark souls when everyone else is playing it on twitch. smart

[2017-01-14 22:08:01 UTC] naddodr: isn't that more than bloodborne?

[2017-01-14 22:08:32 UTC] pr34ch: Tofty1996 fo dude he got the expirience by playing trough demon souls an ds2 and 3 so it is just a given that he would do far better in this game than he did on his first try
[2017-01-14 22:08:33 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @dankedan We can't remember everything, it's understandable :p
[2017-01-14 22:08:34 UTC] messerscohen: oreimo I'm sure Phil will find some parts challenging

[2017-01-14 22:09:16 UTC] khawaja7: @somone192, yea i hope for it to come to pc since its koei techmi so i can actually play it
[2017-01-14 22:09:26 UTC] akioartorius: @DarksydePhil , you still need to go to the forest to finish up
[2017-01-14 22:09:27 UTC] oreimo33: nito is pretty easy compared to the other bosses
[2017-01-14 22:09:31 UTC] bobbi_ling: wow so difficult, such wow
[2017-01-14 22:09:31 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @dankedan For New Game? Oh for sure, New Game Plus is where you need to start putting in extra work.
[2017-01-14 22:09:36 UTC] dicklightning: stream is always debating the same shit, let him do his gamefag run and sit back and laugh at the antics Kappa
[2017-01-14 22:09:41 UTC] chuckrock8419: This is not a good place for Hobbits!
[2017-01-14 22:09:43 UTC] bbt_2016: @tofty1996 so you don't want to see him do good? He's using items he's gotten on stream eith no grinding
[2017-01-14 22:09:50 UTC] oreimo33: let me guess: he hates skeletons, right?
[2017-01-14 22:09:52 UTC] punishedmac: the only thing that will make this interesting now is if he plays through the rest of the game as human
[2017-01-14 22:09:53 UTC] oreimo33: that never gets old
[2017-01-14 22:10:02 UTC] rpgasm34: BrokeBack
[2017-01-14 22:10:10 UTC] oreimo33: or he could talk about gaming news while playing. that would be interesting to.
[2017-01-14 22:10:16 UTC] dankedan: @LemonPlaysGames Yeah I used washing pole+10 in my new game plus with magic lol the bkh would be good if you were actually having a hard time
[2017-01-14 22:10:18 UTC] jeremytheboss: no one likes skeletons theyre sp00ky lul
[2017-01-14 22:10:23 UTC] oreimo33: but a "professional gamer" talking about gaming news? that's just fluff!
[2017-01-14 22:10:23 UTC] bobbi_ling: lol

[2017-01-14 22:10:41 UTC] bethe2670: Gravelord Nito, Seath the Scaleless, The Four Kings and Lost Izalith is the proper order to kill em
[2017-01-14 22:10:44 UTC] dicklightning: it'll take 20 years for him to improve his commentary, just like coming to twitch Kappa
[2017-01-14 22:10:46 UTC] somone192: I hope so too khawaja7 tecmo been doing some PC ports lately so maybe
[2017-01-14 22:10:50 UTC] tepexy: oreimo33 its hard to focus at games like this and then talk news at the same time
[2017-01-14 22:10:53 UTC] primmmy: wtf are you on about skid @Oreimo33
[2017-01-14 22:10:57 UTC] bobbi_ling: no beth there is no proper order
[2017-01-14 22:11:04 UTC] oreimo33: many people manage to do it.
[2017-01-14 22:11:06 UTC] shotinthedeep: He's already fought two bosses this stream
[2017-01-14 22:11:09 UTC] dicklightning: talking about literally anything by playing is pretty easy
[2017-01-14 22:11:11 UTC] messerscohen: dude all you have to do is talk, bosses might require silence
[2017-01-14 22:11:11 UTC] shotinthedeep: That's preetty good
[2017-01-14 22:11:13 UTC] tepexy: but does he need to?

[2017-01-14 22:11:26 UTC] messerscohen: his commentary is trash anyway
[2017-01-14 22:11:27 UTC] bethe2670: dont count as 2
[2017-01-14 22:11:34 UTC] tofty1996: @bbt_2016, sick of this accusation already... I want him to succeed but I want him to get the proper experience of playing this game. I don't blame him for using BKH, I don't begrudge him for using it, but it makes the game too easy and takes away from one of the core aspects of the game which is its difficulty and the satisfaction when you beat it
[2017-01-14 22:11:39 UTC] christoph5782: @Bethe2670 You kill the Four Kings first, and the creature there tells you to fill the lordvessel with the souls of tve other 3

[2017-01-14 22:12:05 UTC] somone192: khawaja7, problem is that the PC ports aren't necessarily optimized and fans are patching it for the developers lol
[2017-01-14 22:12:06 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: i would be interested in seeing phil play more new games at harder difficulties.
[2017-01-14 22:12:10 UTC] unquietmist: Fucking Skeletons
[2017-01-14 22:12:14 UTC] akioartorius: So Phil is never going to the forest is he?
[2017-01-14 22:12:21 UTC] bethe2670: jeremytheboss has been ignored
[2017-01-14 22:12:21 UTC] chuckrock8419: Super Dungeons of Destiny my arms wide open take me in friend

[2017-01-14 22:12:55 UTC] bethe2670: he worse than you
[2017-01-14 22:12:55 UTC] alexaponteftw: @bethe2670 don't let the detractors get to you
[2017-01-14 22:12:57 UTC] khawaja7: @somone192, namco's ports now-a-days pretty good

[2017-01-14 22:13:16 UTC] bethe2670: anyone worse than bobbi needs to be ignored
[2017-01-14 22:13:18 UTC] akioartorius: Yes he did. or am I confusing it with DS3?
[2017-01-14 22:13:19 UTC] messerscohen: Detractors make up the majority of his views, don't flatter yourself
[2017-01-14 22:13:23 UTC] dankedan: "way better" should say "More op"
[2017-01-14 22:13:28 UTC] bobbi_ling: wow beth :(
[2017-01-14 22:13:31 UTC] somethingyer2: this game being ported to pc ruined the fanbase
[2017-01-14 22:13:31 UTC] shotinthedeep: He can't hear your insults jeremy
[2017-01-14 22:13:31 UTC] nazgorg: @Tofty1996 to be clear im not sayin anything bad about u its other ppl that act rude cuz he doesnt play like they want to thats the issue
[2017-01-14 22:13:32 UTC] gaylordbutthump: DS3, he hasn't killed havel in this playthrough yet
[2017-01-14 22:13:34 UTC] dicklightning: missing two of the best rings in the game MingLee
[2017-01-14 22:13:35 UTC] christoph5782: So Phil is doing this area without a divine weapon?

[2017-01-14 22:28:22 UTC] popsicolo: I can see both sides of th BKH situation. Admittedly it's a little cheap, but why gimp yourself for no reason?
[2017-01-14 22:28:23 UTC] darksydephil: fuck my audience? how does getting a random weapon drop that is part of the game fuck my audience exactly?
[2017-01-14 22:28:24 UTC] dicklightning: very apparent Kappa

[2017-01-14 22:29:09 UTC] darksydephil: um, when was i a dick to people in the chat???
[2017-01-14 22:29:10 UTC] seraphic17: When half your chat wants you to use something else. Simpleton's logic.
[2017-01-14 22:29:14 UTC] wongoli: ppl just mad he beat O&S in 1 try
[2017-01-14 22:29:19 UTC] akioartorius: Phil, have you tried boiled coka cola with boiled lemons yet? ....

[2017-01-14 22:29:52 UTC] dicklightning: arguing with people in the chat is one of the things people attack you for all the time
[2017-01-14 22:29:55 UTC] bethe2670: eww dragin wtf are you talking about

[2017-01-14 22:30:11 UTC] deinfekted: Like I said, when you release negative content and make yourself look like an ass
[2017-01-14 22:30:12 UTC] darksydephil: "you're using something that breaks the game, according to people who like to see people suffer through it. but its totally legit that it's in there, and it's an incredibly low chance to get. so because you're lucky, you're being offensive."
[2017-01-14 22:30:13 UTC] bethe2670: ps3
[2017-01-14 22:30:13 UTC] dicklightning: most personalities tend to ignore that shit because it's unneccesssary

[2017-01-14 22:30:17 UTC] podusmonens: cheer 1000 akioartorius : Phil, have you tried boiled coka cola with boiled lemons yet? ....
[2017-01-14 22:30:20 UTC] deinfekted: That's exactly what you're going to attract
[2017-01-14 22:30:32 UTC] dinasaurking: I wanted salty tears as much as the next person but the drop happened, it's not an exploit, he didn't go looking for it, it's part of the game. so whatever
[2017-01-14 22:30:32 UTC] ahfear: why ur being defensive phil?
[2017-01-14 22:30:33 UTC] ornightz: He's doin really well in the redemption run , they don't want that it looks like
[2017-01-14 22:30:38 UTC] amineo2: He already played this game, but BKH sure is very boring to watch, there are speedruns for that
[2017-01-14 22:30:43 UTC] lindskillz: that statement is silly Phil get over it lul
[2017-01-14 22:30:43 UTC] ahfear: ur asumming ppl are saying ur cheating?

[2017-01-14 22:30:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no Slashingtomcat
[2017-01-14 22:30:58 UTC] dennisktgamergr_: It's such a good weapon for a PVE run. But when classic bosses that people spent weeks trying to beat become trivial because you do 1/6th of their health in one hit, it pisses people off and makes for a boring run imo
[2017-01-14 22:31:03 UTC] bombaci_mulayim__: Phil they are butthurt, you are doing well thats the problem
[2017-01-14 22:31:06 UTC] akioartorius: the lemon cola thing might help Phil with his sickness who knows. Just trying to help
[2017-01-14 22:31:09 UTC] amineo2: The fact that you're not gonna do the DLC will hurt the playthrough more but whatever
[2017-01-14 22:31:11 UTC] darksydephil: half the people here are whining. its pretty pathetic lol. the other half who actually are fans are enjoying it
[2017-01-14 22:31:16 UTC] radicalenzyme: Don't want to see you suffer, whole part of dark souls is overcoming the challenge no fun when some is just playing easy mode
[2017-01-14 22:31:16 UTC] somefatguysarm: maybe people like to be entertained and like a bit more skill to be watched
[2017-01-14 22:31:17 UTC] deinfekted: Hypocrite
[2017-01-14 22:31:21 UTC] slashingtomcat: why is he not doing the dlc?
[2017-01-14 22:31:25 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @DennisKtGamerGR_, It shouldn't piss anyone off..? If you're pissed off by the way Phil plays his game, you need a reality check, lmao

[2017-01-14 22:32:08 UTC] dinasaurking: there's nothing illegitimate about what is happening
[2017-01-14 22:32:09 UTC] bulletheadhd: its not very enjoyable to watch u steam roll through the game though
[2017-01-14 22:32:10 UTC] mrhuth: So, you didn't get the Drake sword as its OP, but use a different OP weapon Kappa
[2017-01-14 22:32:14 UTC] dicklightning: facts = trolling
[2017-01-14 22:32:17 UTC] radicalenzyme: You are the one that called it a "redemption Run"
[2017-01-14 22:32:19 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: they like him so little they have to watch him all the time....
[2017-01-14 22:32:21 UTC] ornightz: they want him to rage so bad just so they can have something to discuss
[2017-01-14 22:32:23 UTC] dicklightning: i'm responding to what he said
[2017-01-14 22:32:25 UTC] amineo2: @DarksydePhil People wanted stuff like Ebrietas and the Crow hunter in BB, you struggled, it was funny to watch but you overcome it and it was well done
[2017-01-14 22:32:28 UTC] bethe2670: he got a good random early game drop oh well
[2017-01-14 22:32:43 UTC] darksydephil: perhaps....just perhaps...if you were watching this playthrough for suffering, you were watching for the wrong reasons. just saying. maybe it's you, not me, that's in the wrong here, considering i'm using a totally legit weapon. you're really grasping at straws here
[2017-01-14 22:32:45 UTC] greedyendangeredbee: facts=banned. if you fact again you are banned
[2017-01-14 22:32:49 UTC] bethe2670: it in the game so its fair yep thats true
[2017-01-14 22:32:52 UTC] podusmonens: these ar ethe same people who wanted phil to play Deprived, they just wanna see him suffer
[2017-01-14 22:32:54 UTC] bartboulderdash: "Waaah, he's doing good, now I can't derive my pleasure from calling someone names for failing on a video game!"
[2017-01-14 22:32:56 UTC] akioartorius: random rare drop ftw but legal
[2017-01-14 22:32:58 UTC] bobbi_ling: bkga > bkh
[2017-01-14 22:33:02 UTC] dicklightning: there's no wrong reason to watch anything
[2017-01-14 22:33:03 UTC] mrhuth: Phil, you said this was a Legit run, but you it clearly isn't
[2017-01-14 22:33:05 UTC] cheesypickles: Is the stream over?
[2017-01-14 22:33:11 UTC] dicklightning: you should be glad anyone is watching at all
[2017-01-14 22:33:20 UTC] podusmonens: why is it not legit if he found a good weapon?
[2017-01-14 22:33:21 UTC] chupacabras85: Im guess its more boring than the first run Phill, so some people are just waiting for you too rage
[2017-01-14 22:33:23 UTC] availableusername888: game gives a weapon--> its legit, period
[2017-01-14 22:33:24 UTC] podusmonens: wtf???

[2017-01-14 22:33:33 UTC] seraphic17: You wouldn't be this defensive if you actually feel that weapon is legit. You killed Ornstein in 5 hits.
[2017-01-14 22:33:34 UTC] darksydephil: i mean, fuck, look at yourselves. grow up lol
[2017-01-14 22:33:36 UTC] dennisktgamergr_: @DarksydePhil, imagine how much more fun it would be if you were using a different weapon
[2017-01-14 22:33:36 UTC] cheesypickles: Oh
[2017-01-14 22:33:41 UTC] amineo2: I'm pretty sure tons of people would watch you playing BB DLC again even on NG

[2017-01-14 22:33:53 UTC] darksydephil: Seraphic17 : every fact says the weapon is legit. you're talking out of your ass

[2017-01-14 22:35:43 UTC] bobbi_ling: o&s and quelaag are the only hard bosses in the game.
[2017-01-14 22:35:47 UTC] bethe2670: most people wanted phil to get rekt by O&S and are pissed off
[2017-01-14 22:35:47 UTC] darksydephil: ok brb, gonna piss, then continuing on
[2017-01-14 22:35:50 UTC] supatune: BKH was a completely random drop, wasn't like he went looking for it, just got lucky

[2017-01-14 22:36:11 UTC] humpiershaggy: Four Kings are pretty tough
[2017-01-14 22:36:12 UTC] skysands2017: And? It's a weapon in the game. I would use it too. It's strong.
[2017-01-14 22:36:14 UTC] lightweightbro: hi Phil!
[2017-01-14 22:36:14 UTC] dennisktgamergr_: @darksydephil, FromSoftware officialy recognized him on Twitter

[2017-01-14 22:36:32 UTC] akioartorius: Chat, can you list the hardest bosses in the soulborne series? The top five
[2017-01-14 22:36:38 UTC] christoph5782: @Bobbi_ling I had no issues with quelaag. For me the Four Kings was the second hardest boss
[2017-01-14 22:36:42 UTC] mfd4419: Phill why do u feed and to shit like this
[2017-01-14 22:36:43 UTC] wongoli: lol when phil actually gets something right ppl start to complain. there's no winning at this point

[2017-01-14 22:36:46 UTC] radicalenzyme: Sry for intruding into your safe space bro
[2017-01-14 22:36:52 UTC] dicklightning: I really wish you could ignore people talking shit in the stream chat instead of constantly debating people/getting validation from your fan boys Kappa
[2017-01-14 22:36:55 UTC] darksydephil: ok brb piss time
[2017-01-14 22:36:56 UTC] tepexy: seraphic17 this is not critisism though, its just complaining.

[2017-01-14 22:37:12 UTC] somefatguysarm: again, its just going to be reflective in your view numbers and not the gameplay itself from using the BKH
[2017-01-14 22:37:13 UTC] radicalenzyme: Its all the devs fault ofc
[2017-01-14 22:37:15 UTC] somefatguysarm: just saying
[2017-01-14 22:37:21 UTC] aquamancia: from what I'm seeing it's like Seraphic is tearing Phil several new ones MingLee
[2017-01-14 22:37:34 UTC] blacknyellow9: @Amineo2 he did a good job of separating the two of them, killing the faster one first and then taking his time to kill the slower one. if that's not a solid strategy to you then you're an idiot
[2017-01-14 22:37:37 UTC] lightweightbro: wrong Aqua, Sera got owned
[2017-01-14 22:37:37 UTC] popsicolo: Phil should do Co-op commentary with the Interpreter from the Switch presentation the other day. KappaHD

[2017-01-14 22:38:06 UTC] akioartorius: blacknyellow9, but if Phil killed Smough first, he would have gotten the better loot
[2017-01-14 22:38:07 UTC] ahfear: dead i assume

[2017-01-14 22:43:15 UTC] podusmonens: because nintendo seem to be totally autistic. people clearly dont want motion control gimmicks. why do they insisnt on bringing that back?
[2017-01-14 22:43:28 UTC] bioarmer559: scalebound looks terrible anyways, Good riddance
[2017-01-14 22:43:30 UTC] podusmonens: that shit failed years ago

[2017-01-14 22:43:42 UTC] bartboulderdash: To be fair, motion controls are pretty sweet on the Vive, but ... yeah, anywhere else is pretty gimmicky
[2017-01-14 22:43:43 UTC] barbaros901: hehe
[2017-01-14 22:43:45 UTC] bobbi_ling: sleeping dogs > gta
[2017-01-14 22:43:46 UTC] akioartorius: Phil didn't vote I think
[2017-01-14 22:43:46 UTC] punishedmac: @podusmonens, The Switch is designed for the Japanese audience, not the western audience

[2017-01-14 22:44:20 UTC] bethe2670: i loved sleeping dogs
[2017-01-14 22:44:20 UTC] ethershulk: @bioarmer559 yeah, because the hardware wasn't able to handle the game propperly, which is why it eventually got cancelled
[2017-01-14 22:44:31 UTC] podusmonens: so japanese people ar ecrazy about the wii, do they still play it like crazy?
[2017-01-14 22:44:38 UTC] skysands2017: I'm talking about Paid Online. It's obvious it's gonna happen. Sony does it, Microsoft does it, but when Nintendo? *gasp* hell no.
