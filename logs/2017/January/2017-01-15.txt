[2017-01-15 21:26:32 UTC] slyvarium: @redrizla Thats why he begs for people to renew their pledges each month? cause he know we don't owe him anything. It's why he guilt trips fans by saying he won't be able to do this anymore.
[2017-01-15 21:26:38 UTC] hykcraft: all the BK items are a 25% drop
[2017-01-15 21:26:39 UTC] kg1772: phil "blow his nose" then find out about fing of favor as OP as BKH
[2017-01-15 21:26:40 UTC] torosdemon: He'll be SL 120 before he gets to the four kings
[2017-01-15 21:26:41 UTC] bobbi_ling: seath area is boring
[2017-01-15 21:26:47 UTC] brecor: 4 kings are a bitch just for the journey to get to them from the nearest bonfire
[2017-01-15 21:26:52 UTC] jaykirkbride: Am i the only one here who actually likes Phil?
[2017-01-15 21:26:56 UTC] slashingtomcat: HykCraft he's wearing gold serpent ring
[2017-01-15 21:27:01 UTC] hykcraft: that too
[2017-01-15 21:27:01 UTC] dennisktgamergr_: yes @JayKirkbride
[2017-01-15 21:27:05 UTC] redrizla: @Slyvarium, That's just sales talk. You're in control of your wallet.
[2017-01-15 21:27:08 UTC] jonsn0w2015: @jaykirkbride I like Phil
[2017-01-15 21:27:09 UTC] jaykirkbride: hahahaha! :')
[2017-01-15 21:27:13 UTC] seraphic17: Phil should do the 4 kings before Sif
[2017-01-15 21:27:13 UTC] akioartorius: so Phil is only missing the gravelord covenant right?
[2017-01-15 21:27:14 UTC] bbt_2016: i like phil
[2017-01-15 21:27:15 UTC] nazgorg: why ppl force their way of playing games on to others
[2017-01-15 21:27:23 UTC] nazgorg: you either play like me or fuck you
[2017-01-15 21:27:24 UTC] psyoctopi: he do
[2017-01-15 21:27:42 UTC] bulletheadhd: seaphic17, great idea
[2017-01-15 21:27:43 UTC] psyoctopi: did dsp do painted world yet???
[2017-01-15 21:27:45 UTC] jaykirkbride: i like phil, but i also like watching all the haters stuff, like *** and stuff :P
[2017-01-15 21:27:49 UTC] bethe2670: caveman i am
[2017-01-15 21:27:49 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @nazgorg That's dark souls elitists for ya.
[2017-01-15 21:27:51 UTC] xxxnemesisxxx: @Seraphic17, gotta appreciate the freedom of DS1 level design Kappa
[2017-01-15 21:27:52 UTC] bethe2670: :D
[2017-01-15 21:27:52 UTC] 17max93: well the dks community is special, with its special rules
[2017-01-15 21:27:52 UTC] kg1772: @Slyvarium My only input is that he could get a full time job and do YouTube on the side like he did in 2008. He would have health care and no $$$ issues
[2017-01-15 21:27:53 UTC] popsicolo: He has
[2017-01-15 21:28:01 UTC] yugimutopia: No ones forcing anything on phil hes free to play how he wants and im free to insult him for his play style
[2017-01-15 21:28:06 UTC] shotinthedeep: bethecaveman
[2017-01-15 21:28:06 UTC] seraphic17: So meta, Nem Kappa
[2017-01-15 21:28:08 UTC] dennisktgamergr_: @Nazgorg, no body is forcing way to play the game we just want him to drop the weapon
[2017-01-15 21:28:10 UTC] brecor: What!? He hasn't done Sif yet!?
[2017-01-15 21:28:16 UTC] captainplutoo: nobody is forcing him to play a certain way @Nazgorg , just stand by your words of this being a redemption legit run.
[2017-01-15 21:28:17 UTC] xxxnemesisxxx: @Seraphic17, but 4 kings I think will provide the biggest challenge to his BKH crap
[2017-01-15 21:28:21 UTC] bethe2670: no sif
[2017-01-15 21:28:27 UTC] hoodr1ch: its not maxed out
[2017-01-15 21:28:29 UTC] punishedmac: oh man him even getting to 4 kings is going to be an experience
[2017-01-15 21:28:35 UTC] magicmissilemage: @kg1772, implying he already has and is just trying to get some extra shekels
[2017-01-15 21:28:36 UTC] arrolwashere: hawgh
[2017-01-15 21:28:38 UTC] nazgorg: @LemonPlaysGames thats not only in ds
[2017-01-15 21:28:38 UTC] yugimutopia: Forcing him would be putting a gun to his head and sayin"no shield!, i frame and roll like a man!"
[2017-01-15 21:28:39 UTC] slashingtomcat: @JayKirkbride it's good watching the streams but the other people edit and cut the videos for a more enjoyable experience
[2017-01-15 21:28:40 UTC] slyvarium: @redrizla There's no doubt there. But you said he knows his "fans don't have to" yet he still insists that they do with fervor equal to that of a priest.
[2017-01-15 21:28:41 UTC] slurmdrinker: Time to destroy dspHmm
[2017-01-15 21:28:42 UTC] bethe2670: he skipped sif, priscilla
[2017-01-15 21:28:43 UTC] bobbi_ling: dual wield
[2017-01-15 21:28:44 UTC] 17max93: using the bkh for a redemption run is like healing in pvp
[2017-01-15 21:28:52 UTC] khawaja7: skipped sif for now
[2017-01-15 21:28:52 UTC] dantseb: upgrate armor
[2017-01-15 21:28:53 UTC] bethe2670: and he didnt kill gwyndolyn
[2017-01-15 21:28:55 UTC] xxxnemesisxxx: @Seraphic17, I was wondering, if he decided to go online, would you invade him? :D
[2017-01-15 21:28:57 UTC] royal_phalanx91: people don't heal in pvp?
[2017-01-15 21:28:59 UTC] khawaja7: sif is not optional
[2017-01-15 21:29:00 UTC] bbt_2016: even though his play stylee is 100 legit lol ok haters 👌👌👌
[2017-01-15 21:29:05 UTC] dadepths: What's a redemption run?
[2017-01-15 21:29:06 UTC] bobbi_ling: he didnt skip sif he needs to do that later
[2017-01-15 21:29:07 UTC] jaykirkbride: How do you reply to people like that?
[2017-01-15 21:29:09 UTC] brecor: he won't last the journey to 4 kings from the nearest bonfire most times.
[2017-01-15 21:29:10 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Everyone I've pvpd in DS3 has healed
[2017-01-15 21:29:10 UTC] kuroriku: i love listening to him forge weapons. so zen like.
[2017-01-15 21:29:11 UTC] sipuli91: @xxxnemesisxxx if they do the phil truly is an awful player. kings go down so fast with that weapon there will never be 2 at once or even a threat of that
[2017-01-15 21:29:11 UTC] jaykirkbride: or is it a whisper?
[2017-01-15 21:29:13 UTC] bethe2670: and he one shot O&S
[2017-01-15 21:29:15 UTC] 17max93: no you dont heal in pvp DansGame
[2017-01-15 21:29:16 UTC] winderfiend764: One without summons
[2017-01-15 21:29:20 UTC] psyoctopi: all you need is to flush lando water. then its easy yo get to 4kings
[2017-01-15 21:29:22 UTC] hykcraft: theres pvp community rules to never heal
[2017-01-15 21:29:24 UTC] gaylordbutthump: you don't heal in duels*
[2017-01-15 21:29:25 UTC] punishedmac: DS3 is a different pvp experience. everyone heals
[2017-01-15 21:29:26 UTC] bethe2670: bobbi he could'v done that by now
[2017-01-15 21:29:31 UTC] hoodr1ch: did he fight o/s?
[2017-01-15 21:29:32 UTC] slashingtomcat: @JayKirkbride do an @ than start typing the name thenn press tab
[2017-01-15 21:29:33 UTC] gnomusy: Why haven't you upgraded your armor one bit?
[2017-01-15 21:29:36 UTC] magicmissilemage: @Royal_Phalanx91, only in invasions
[2017-01-15 21:29:39 UTC] slyvarium: @redrizla if he could understand that he wouldn't insist they keep or raise pledges and be happy with the support they so faithfully provide
[2017-01-15 21:29:42 UTC] bethe2670: he could've done that before he got to anor londo
[2017-01-15 21:29:42 UTC] winderfiend764: For real? Honorless pricks
[2017-01-15 21:29:48 UTC] baumer_man: healing is for scrubs
[2017-01-15 21:29:49 UTC] kg1772: how does he know about the forrest unless he looked at a guide?
[2017-01-15 21:29:49 UTC] xspheerx: There's item called homeward bone you know lol
[2017-01-15 21:29:52 UTC] yugimutopia: @bbt_2016 what do you mean legit?
[2017-01-15 21:29:56 UTC] bobbi_ling: not optional
[2017-01-15 21:30:01 UTC] gaylordbutthump: ds3 pvp is trash tbh
[2017-01-15 21:30:02 UTC] psyoctopi: do them. you get souls
[2017-01-15 21:30:04 UTC] xgameofpwns: Sif is mandatory
[2017-01-15 21:30:06 UTC] jaykirkbride: @Slashingtomcat oh cool, thanks! Agreed, TIHYDP's are more enjoyable than a 10 hour raw gameplay
[2017-01-15 21:30:07 UTC] iconicmaster1: Star wolf
[2017-01-15 21:30:08 UTC] slurmdrinker: rekt
[2017-01-15 21:30:09 UTC] mc_burnout26: do them
[2017-01-15 21:30:09 UTC] availableusername888: sif will make him cry
[2017-01-15 21:30:11 UTC] xspheerx: Forest optional? That's new
[2017-01-15 21:30:14 UTC] captainplutoo: Someone better subscribe or give some bits or this isn't gonna be streamed tomorrow. Streams have to be profitable
[2017-01-15 21:30:16 UTC] lemonplaysgames: This is a redemption run. The point of this redemption run was to not summon for help. Your version of this redemption run is "Phil must not use summons, must purposefully use a weaker weapon."
[2017-01-15 21:30:17 UTC] jango_fett_boba_fett: @darksydephil Sif isn't optional, you need to kill him for a ring to fight the four kings
[2017-01-15 21:30:19 UTC] brecor: Kill the poochy!
[2017-01-15 21:30:20 UTC] dantseb: there are some good rings there
[2017-01-15 21:30:21 UTC] dennisktgamergr_: nothing wrong with looking at a guide
[2017-01-15 21:30:29 UTC] miroslau: who is this noob who spoils blood in my veins?
[2017-01-15 21:30:30 UTC] winderfiend764: Sif is easy
[2017-01-15 21:30:31 UTC] mc_burnout26: go to the forrest Phil
[2017-01-15 21:30:36 UTC] dadepths: I thought he quit this game cuz he was in blightown and couldn't do anything
[2017-01-15 21:30:38 UTC] yugimutopia: @availableusername888 he will burn through sif like hes nothing this late in the game
[2017-01-15 21:30:38 UTC] jonsn0w2015: Sif isn't optional lol
[2017-01-15 21:30:43 UTC] baumer_man: I want Phil to get memed on by the hydra
[2017-01-15 21:30:43 UTC] khawaja7: yea
[2017-01-15 21:30:44 UTC] ghoullord: forest is optional if you don't want to complete the game
[2017-01-15 21:30:44 UTC] weirdbutt: but this is the no guide redemption run!!
[2017-01-15 21:30:45 UTC] yugimutopia: The damage will be nuts
[2017-01-15 21:30:45 UTC] psyoctopi: butterfly is easiest boss
[2017-01-15 21:30:49 UTC] availableusername888: yeah prob
[2017-01-15 21:30:50 UTC] bethe2670: he couldve killled the butterfly before the capra demon in honesty
[2017-01-15 21:30:52 UTC] punishedmac: In DS1 invaders are locked out of using estus so hosts healing while fighting an invader is generally frowned upon
[2017-01-15 21:30:53 UTC] slashingtomcat: @JayKirkbride id prefer to watch a *** then a 20 min video titled 20 mins of nothing
[2017-01-15 21:30:53 UTC] popsicolo: Sif BibleThump
[2017-01-15 21:30:56 UTC] chocobotamer: okay?
[2017-01-15 21:30:56 UTC] yugimutopia: He should have faced 40 or so levels ago
[2017-01-15 21:30:56 UTC] magicmissilemage: tbh the only "redemption run" phil can do is the old hunters
[2017-01-15 21:31:04 UTC] akioartorius: if you do the dlc before Sif, you get a special cutscene
[2017-01-15 21:31:07 UTC] bbt_2016: @yugimutopia he didn't grind, alter the game, farm for OP gear for an advantage, hasn't summoned etc everything he's leveled/Got has been linear normal character progression
[2017-01-15 21:31:08 UTC] 17max93: leave Sif alone FeelsBadMan
[2017-01-15 21:31:09 UTC] khawaja7: what magic said
[2017-01-15 21:31:09 UTC] bobbi_ling: you and your butterfly beth
[2017-01-15 21:31:16 UTC] gaylordbutthump: @punishedmac invaders can use humanity to heal though
[2017-01-15 21:31:18 UTC] khawaja7: Sif needs to get rekt FeelsGoodMan
[2017-01-15 21:31:20 UTC] mc_burnout26: lobosWolf not poor sif
[2017-01-15 21:31:20 UTC] jaykirkbride: hahaha what? @Slashingtomcat
[2017-01-15 21:31:22 UTC] sokpatreon: Hows the NEW PC FUND going phil CurseLit
[2017-01-15 21:31:29 UTC] bethe2670: that wolf couldve been killed before the iron golem
[2017-01-15 21:31:33 UTC] brecor: butterfly isn't easy if you've no ranged stats
[2017-01-15 21:31:41 UTC] iconicmaster1: Pretty butterfly CoolStoryBob
[2017-01-15 21:31:43 UTC] jango_fett_boba_fett: @darksydephil Sif is mandatory not optional you need to kill him for an item to enter the Abyss and kill four kings
[2017-01-15 21:31:44 UTC] bobbi_ling: costs 10k to fight sif
[2017-01-15 21:31:45 UTC] psyoctopi: the taint lmao
[2017-01-15 21:31:48 UTC] punishedmac: @gaylordbutthump, yup, true, and if they do, hosts are free to heal as much as they'd like, imo
[2017-01-15 21:31:49 UTC] sipuli91: @punishedmac no it's not. Invaders just use humanities. There are no unwritten rules for invasions, do what you must to destroy the target. Duels are different
[2017-01-15 21:31:54 UTC] baumer_man: The butterfly is the only boss where fatrolling is key
[2017-01-15 21:31:56 UTC] popsicolo: Halberd to the gooch WutFace
[2017-01-15 21:31:57 UTC] bethe2670: so yeah he skipped it bobbi
[2017-01-15 21:32:00 UTC] 17max93: dsp need like 4 hits of so for the butterfly
[2017-01-15 21:32:03 UTC] 1buttondash: it's back Kappa
[2017-01-15 21:32:17 UTC] bulletheadhd: lemonplaysgames, the pooint of this run was to prove that he can complete the game with relying on what some would consider cheap tactics, bkh included
[2017-01-15 21:32:19 UTC] gaylordbutthump: now, is he just gonna run past?
[2017-01-15 21:32:22 UTC] bethe2670: pops i beleive you could survive that not sure you would want to
[2017-01-15 21:32:23 UTC] naddodr: tbh, Phil would probably still be stuck at Quelaag if he didn't have this halberd
[2017-01-15 21:32:23 UTC] popsicolo: Lets see how he handles the boar this time.
[2017-01-15 21:32:25 UTC] magicmissilemage: the boars HeyGuys
[2017-01-15 21:32:27 UTC] bartboulderdash: Yeah, if he 2H's that for Moonlight Butterfly, I imagine hilariously quick finish
[2017-01-15 21:32:29 UTC] nerv117: u can fight sif for free from the hydra direction
[2017-01-15 21:32:30 UTC] jonsn0w2015: I know he said it's not an option for him but I still want to see him play through the old hunters more than anything
[2017-01-15 21:32:38 UTC] winderfiend764: Stab it in the asshole
[2017-01-15 21:32:41 UTC] akioartorius: this boar is smaller than the other one
[2017-01-15 21:32:42 UTC] gaylordbutthump: oh nope he's just gonna try to cheese it
[2017-01-15 21:32:42 UTC] hykcraft: backstab the butt Kappa
[2017-01-15 21:32:43 UTC] captainplutoo: Phil would of rage quit the game if he didnt have the BKH
[2017-01-15 21:32:45 UTC] brecor: lol such a broken game
[2017-01-15 21:32:46 UTC] dadepths: ResidentSleeper
[2017-01-15 21:32:48 UTC] slashingtomcat: @JayKirkbride one of the videos in the redemption run playlist is "20 Minutes of Fail. HOW DO YOU GET IT?!"
[2017-01-15 21:32:55 UTC] cosmos35: he still hasn't been to the sunlight altar yet either
[2017-01-15 21:32:56 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @bulletheadhd Again, that is your opinion that it's a cheap tactic. For Phil, he got a good weapon as a random drop.
[2017-01-15 21:33:00 UTC] iconicmaster1: Moonlight from Pokemon
[2017-01-15 21:33:02 UTC] seewad: lol cheese it through the doorway
[2017-01-15 21:33:02 UTC] naddodr: the one enemy in the game that's resistant to slash damage
[2017-01-15 21:33:08 UTC] nerv117: even the boar was cheesed
[2017-01-15 21:33:11 UTC] hykcraft: fucking cheese
[2017-01-15 21:33:12 UTC] jaykirkbride: Oh , haha i haven't seen that @Slashingtomcat
[2017-01-15 21:33:17 UTC] 17max93: just looked it up butterfly has 1,5k hp, so, yeah...
[2017-01-15 21:33:17 UTC] yugimutopia: @bbt_2016 the devs did not design ds1 with tge bkh as a starting weapon in mind, it has not been normal progress since then, besides ive been saying his play style is boring, not illegitimate. It takes no skill as he just holds his shield up and watches his stamina guage.
[2017-01-15 21:33:18 UTC] winderfiend764: Lucky bastard
[2017-01-15 21:33:21 UTC] tepexy: please wear it
[2017-01-15 21:33:22 UTC] captainplutoo: cheesed
[2017-01-15 21:33:25 UTC] brecor: Dark Souls is a cheese game
[2017-01-15 21:33:29 UTC] torosdemon: phil cheesed the boar for the second time. "'REDEMPTION"'"
[2017-01-15 21:33:41 UTC] baumer_man: I wish all the bosses health scaled with your level
[2017-01-15 21:33:42 UTC] winderfiend764: Wear it
[2017-01-15 21:33:44 UTC] 0megaj0ker: :D
[2017-01-15 21:33:46 UTC] magicmissilemage: phil change your fucking trousers why are you cosplaying gwyndolin
[2017-01-15 21:33:48 UTC] bethe2670: lol
[2017-01-15 21:33:49 UTC] bulletheadhd: yes, but its his crutch. he woulnt have gotten half as far as he has without it
[2017-01-15 21:33:51 UTC] wongoli: that actually looks pretty gud
[2017-01-15 21:33:51 UTC] brecor: you can cheese every 2nd boss. Devs did nothing after releasing it.
[2017-01-15 21:33:52 UTC] n0_h3r0: That's the look
[2017-01-15 21:33:53 UTC] availableusername888: very fashionable
[2017-01-15 21:33:54 UTC] dxfreedom: They only way people wont complain is if phil did a naked soul level 1 run. But I quess they would still cry "rolling is OP cheese"
[2017-01-15 21:33:56 UTC] bobbi_ling: fashion souls Kappa
[2017-01-15 21:34:00 UTC] lieutenantlefty: lmao he cheeses the boar
[2017-01-15 21:34:04 UTC] winderfiend764: Now go bare chested
[2017-01-15 21:34:05 UTC] punishedmac: most quality fashion souls I have ever experienced bravo
[2017-01-15 21:34:06 UTC] shotinthedeep: That looks ridiculous
[2017-01-15 21:34:08 UTC] dadepths: why does he always sound upset? "the game gave a helmet? what the hell, are you kidding me?"
[2017-01-15 21:34:10 UTC] hykcraft: boar isnt a boss
[2017-01-15 21:34:11 UTC] slashingtomcat: @JayKirkbride you dont want to it's quite literally him trying to jump to crows nest for 20 minutes un-edited
[2017-01-15 21:34:11 UTC] captainplutoo: cheese'
[2017-01-15 21:34:14 UTC] akioartorius: lol, looks good kappa

[2017-01-15 22:25:23 UTC] lemonplaysgames: From Software claims they're not making any more souls games after this last DLC for 3, right? Then they really should remaster Demon's and DS1 for modern consoles for a farewell.

[2017-01-15 22:29:13 UTC] gaylordbutthump: metroid is definitely mature themes. it's inspired heavily by the alien series
[2017-01-15 22:29:28 UTC] gaylordbutthump: too bad nintendo's basically forgotten about metroid
[2017-01-15 22:29:42 UTC] nerv117: i would have bought a switch for metroid
[2017-01-15 22:29:57 UTC] thewanderer1800: @somone192 We never seen them kiss on camera. I mean isnt that what makes a good relationship? Affection and romance? Cinammontoastken and pewdiepie seem to have more passion in their relationships. Maybe Phil could learn from them
[2017-01-15 22:30:02 UTC] bobbi_ling: violent ken will sell the switch Kappa

[2017-01-15 22:30:43 UTC] somone192: lol I never talked about romance, just them playing the game Thewanderer1800
[2017-01-15 22:30:48 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I need more incentive to fork over 400 dollars for the Switch
[2017-01-15 22:30:50 UTC] nerv117: lol sf2 will sell the switch

[2017-01-15 22:31:53 UTC] naddodr: Leanna and Phil won't have a real relationship until they're fucking on stream, according to the internet
[2017-01-15 22:31:54 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Why 400 you ask when the base is 300? Because the pro controler is 70 dollars and a game is 50. That's a butt load of money for an underpowered tablet that can't even run Zelda at 1080p..
[2017-01-15 22:31:55 UTC] iconicmaster1: What the name of the this music playing

[2017-01-15 22:34:37 UTC] lvlpower: spider Gwen Kreygasm
[2017-01-15 22:34:46 UTC] captainplutoo: thats why the PS4 controllers are cheaper, their build quality isn't premium
[2017-01-15 22:34:47 UTC] iconicmaster1: Eww
[2017-01-15 22:34:53 UTC] thewanderer1800: It would be amazing if Phil came out to esports arena to play in Street fighter. Sadly hes sick of that game

[2017-01-15 22:38:23 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @captainplutoo If they truly have active lifestyles, they're not going outside to play games. They're going out to be "active", lol. That's where Nintendo fails to understand.
[2017-01-15 22:38:26 UTC] captainplutoo: Because its 2017 @DinasaurKing Wifi exist

[2017-01-15 23:15:39 UTC] yacherdy: @Normonaut On Dark Souls? No. Right now I'm playing it through for the first time. I've played multiple games multiple times and I've never gotten the urge to "speed" through it. I like to take my time and explore.
[2017-01-15 23:15:42 UTC] matt_radartechnician: man why didn't From Software give us Metal Wolf Chaos... the game is too American for America

[2017-01-15 23:16:43 UTC] normonaut: YaCherdy, well speedrunning is entirely different. it's the challenge of beating your own time, finding a new route, completing something challenging without slipping up. it's all in the thrill
[2017-01-15 23:16:48 UTC] slickgamble: Huuuuuuuuuug! :D
[2017-01-15 23:16:53 UTC] xxalex2394: speed run are cool to watch

[2017-01-15 23:17:21 UTC] normonaut: Kos isn't that hard tho
[2017-01-15 23:17:22 UTC] romanspartan_: pillars are phil's best friend in this game

[2017-01-15 23:17:27 UTC] debaykin: 5
[2017-01-15 23:17:30 UTC] yacherdy: @Normonaut Fair enough. Kudos to people who enjoy that and the challenge that comes with it. It's just not for me I guess.
