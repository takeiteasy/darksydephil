[2017-01-27 00:15:33 UTC] darksydephil: nobody cares
[2017-01-27 00:15:50 UTC] darksydephil: if he's clowning me it means he's so fucking boring he can't entertain his own audience with actual meaningful content
[2017-01-27 00:15:53 UTC] deliciousmayo: I think 6 will have reminiscence mode that will allow you to watch the cutscenes from previous games
[2017-01-27 00:15:58 UTC] deliciousmayo: Not sure though
[2017-01-27 00:16:01 UTC] kadish88: Lol i agree
[2017-01-27 00:16:08 UTC] darksydephil: and of all people, the spoiled brat fat as fuck douchebag kid who always treats people in the FGC like dirt shouldn't be making fun of ANYONE
[2017-01-27 00:16:09 UTC] kadish88: Hes a fat idiot
[2017-01-27 00:16:26 UTC] kadish88: He was playing your vids on his stream lol
[2017-01-27 00:16:34 UTC] darksydephil: what vids? fighting game stuff???
[2017-01-27 00:16:41 UTC] darksydephil: i haven't even played seriously in ages
[2017-01-27 00:16:45 UTC] kadish88: Yea but he stopped
[2017-01-27 00:17:08 UTC] gtamatte: @Deliciousmayo I hope it does for the newer fans
[2017-01-27 00:17:17 UTC] kadish88: He was playing your fighting ones you talking bout evo and stuff
[2017-01-27 00:17:52 UTC] darksydephil: Floe is seriously one of the worst people EVER in the FGC. almost everyone disliked him for being an elitist douchebag. and he traveled everywhere on his parents' dime, never even paid his own way, mooched off of everyone else too
[2017-01-27 00:18:23 UTC] kadish88: Yea i totally agree i hate that guy
[2017-01-27 00:18:53 UTC] kadish88: Just forget him hes just mad your doing good
[2017-01-27 00:19:05 UTC] darksydephil: for his dumbfuck ass to try and make fun of ME, someone not even in the community for a long ass time, says something. he's a real piece of shit and always was. just because he pretends to be some nice guy on twitch to get donations for doing nothing doesn't mean he's changed. he's just acting
[2017-01-27 00:20:01 UTC] kadish88: Yea just dont even say anything sorry i told you but i thought you would like to know ive ben a fan of yours for 8 years
[2017-01-27 00:20:47 UTC] ingo505: Phil, you gonna makes some videos of fighting games soon?
[2017-01-27 00:20:54 UTC] darksydephil: well truth is, i dont care. im sure tons of FGC people still talk shit about me on the regular. that's what happens when you're a boring no-talent fuck who is desperate to make people laugh
[2017-01-27 00:21:27 UTC] darksydephil: Injustice 2 in may, tekken 7 in june, i'd say yes lol
[2017-01-27 00:21:31 UTC] cornhorlio: lol from what Ive seen of your online matches you dont seem like the most pleasent person yourself
[2017-01-27 00:21:32 UTC] kadish88: Yea he is pathetic dont worry phil just keep doing you
[2017-01-27 00:22:11 UTC] kadish88: @cornhorlio phil is real thats why floe is a fat piece of shit
[2017-01-27 00:22:56 UTC] kadish88: @cornhorlio phil is one of the true real streamers/youtuber
[2017-01-27 00:23:12 UTC] cornhorlio: lol yet floe was worlds more succesfful in fighting games than Phil, thats just a fact. I came in late so idk what exactly is going on between Phil and Floe
[2017-01-27 00:23:29 UTC] darksydephil: um
[2017-01-27 00:23:53 UTC] darksydephil: FLoe played way more than me because he didn't have to hold down a job. his parents were rich and paid his spoiled ass to travel the world and play Street Fighter while i was busting my ass to get through college
[2017-01-27 00:24:01 UTC] kadish88: Nothing floe was just making fun of him on stream and playing his videos and talking shit bout him
[2017-01-27 00:24:27 UTC] darksydephil: to say Floe is more successful than me is like saying someone who plays Basketball all day every day is better than someone who plays once a week
[2017-01-27 00:24:58 UTC] cornhorlio: lol Phil, having a job isnt an excuse as why you werent as succesfful in the FGC, look at HungryBox, dude is an engineer with a career and one of the best smash players in the world
[2017-01-27 00:25:09 UTC] darksydephil: so please, do not pick this fight. you will lose. Floe was always a negative nasty piece of shit and there are tons of people who will corroborate that story
[2017-01-27 00:25:24 UTC] cornhorlio: Viscant has a real career too and he did pretty well too
[2017-01-27 00:25:39 UTC] kadish88: I agree with phil @cornhorlio floe is the worst type of person
[2017-01-27 00:25:41 UTC] cornhorlio: and like I said, I came in late so I dont know exactly whats happening between you too
[2017-01-27 00:26:00 UTC] darksydephil: Viscant sat around playing internet poker to make money. but he is far more naturally talented than FLoe, i'd say, and he's a much nicer person too
[2017-01-27 00:26:20 UTC] kadish88: Phil always minds his buisness but ppl wont leave him alone there always on his nuts
[2017-01-27 00:27:08 UTC] cornhorlio: I undestand that, but your point of having to hold job isnt the main reason you werent successful in fighting games, thats more of the point I was making
[2017-01-27 00:27:28 UTC] darksydephil: actually it really was
[2017-01-27 00:27:40 UTC] kadish88: Anyways phil sorry if i told you hope you aint mad
[2017-01-27 00:27:45 UTC] darksydephil: i never got to practice half as much as the guys who won tournaments. they went to EVERY major, every big event and played about 10 times more than me
[2017-01-27 00:27:59 UTC] darksydephil: every time i went to a tourney it was like trying to play catchup for 3 months of practice i didnt get
[2017-01-27 00:28:24 UTC] darksydephil: but thats just life. some people get it easier than others, i didnt have it easy and didn't have that freedom to actually play all the time
[2017-01-27 00:29:23 UTC] cornhorlio: But Phil, other people dont have it easy and yet still wreck hwever they go, HungryBox again, engineer with career, they dont have alot of free time, but as well as naturally talented and understanding his faults and getting better hes one of the best
[2017-01-27 00:29:41 UTC] darksydephil: what the fuck does that have to do with me and Floe? it's a completely unrelated topic
[2017-01-27 00:29:45 UTC] darksydephil: its not even the same games lol
[2017-01-27 00:30:18 UTC] cornhorlio: again, Im addressing the comment that you having a job is what resulted in you not doing well, I mentioned like 3 times that I dont know whats going on with Floe so I cant really discuss it
[2017-01-27 00:30:48 UTC] darksydephil: listen, if you want to suck Floe's cock, go ahead. if you want to say i'm a bad fighting game player, go ahead. none of that has to do with the topic, which is that Floe is a piece of shit and his talking shit about me on his stream is HILARIOUS. i could roast the fuck out of that guy daily but i actually have meaningful work to do
[2017-01-27 00:30:51 UTC] cornhorlio: Doesnt matter, to do well in smash takes alot of work, its a very mechanic heavy game just like any other
[2017-01-27 00:31:01 UTC] darksydephil: dude
[2017-01-27 00:31:07 UTC] darksydephil: you're the only person here talking about his
[2017-01-27 00:31:20 UTC] darksydephil: you have nothing to say pertinent to what was being discussed lol
[2017-01-27 00:31:31 UTC] cornhorlio: Lol we are like the only people talking.....
[2017-01-27 00:31:47 UTC] cornhorlio: unless a disucssion is happening elsewhere that I dont know about
[2017-01-27 00:31:51 UTC] cornhorlio: than thats different
[2017-01-27 00:32:23 UTC] kadish88: Bro @cornhorlio who cars about this shit phil is a great person and has good content
[2017-01-27 00:32:36 UTC] cornhorlio: Did I ever say he wasnt?
[2017-01-27 00:32:59 UTC] kadish88: No but your arguing with him when you should have his back
[2017-01-27 00:33:20 UTC] kadish88: And yes you did your first comment
[2017-01-27 00:34:02 UTC] cornhorlio: lol I dont think I can say it more that I dont know whats floe said or whats going on
[2017-01-27 00:34:05 UTC] cornhorlio: its been 4 times now lol
[2017-01-27 00:34:23 UTC] cornhorlio: is there a VOD
[2017-01-27 00:34:26 UTC] cornhorlio: link that
[2017-01-27 00:34:31 UTC] cornhorlio: of what he said
[2017-01-27 00:34:37 UTC] ingo505: Kadish, why are you sucking up to him like that? I understand you are a fan and like him, but no need to go this far man. He can talk fo himself.
[2017-01-27 00:36:02 UTC] kadish88: Im not sucking up to him but at one point it gets old poor guy is just playing games and tryna do better then assholes like floe talk shit about him and make him seem like a bad person we need to stick up for him
[2017-01-27 00:36:20 UTC] kadish88: As his fans
[2017-01-27 00:36:40 UTC] cornhorlio: what did he say exactly
[2017-01-27 00:36:43 UTC] cornhorlio: is there a vod
[2017-01-27 00:37:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the bit I seen Cornhorlio he was talking about some evo story between Phil and a dude named Jaha
[2017-01-27 00:38:09 UTC] cornhorlio: whats the TL;DR of the story
[2017-01-27 00:38:46 UTC] kadish88: But he was playing his vids to and calling him names
[2017-01-27 00:39:30 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Sorry Cornhorlio I dunno he was referencing it in his chat,someone in his chat quoted what Phil said here and he was responding to it.
[2017-01-27 00:39:48 UTC] cornhorlio: How recent was this
[2017-01-27 00:39:55 UTC] darksydephil: it's like I said. when you have nothing whatsoever to offer the world, you shit on others to create "entertainment." it's pathetic
[2017-01-27 00:40:18 UTC] kadish88: Like 20 min ago
[2017-01-27 00:40:20 UTC] darksydephil: he's literally the last person on Earth who should be talking shit about anyone, but because it's the internet, he hides behind it lol
[2017-01-27 00:40:40 UTC] kadish88: Hes such a nasty person omg
[2017-01-27 00:40:54 UTC] kadish88: Always talking bout dicks and shit
[2017-01-27 00:41:22 UTC] cornhorlio: lol Phil, it wasnt cool for him to talk shit, thats never acceptable. But to say he offered nothing to the world is no better, especially when he has come up with good tech in the past. Im not defending him cause again, idk what he said, but to go out and just name call again doesnt make you look like the bigger person
[2017-01-27 00:42:29 UTC] darksydephil: "just name call"
[2017-01-27 00:42:31 UTC] darksydephil: are you daft?
[2017-01-27 00:42:39 UTC] darksydephil: i just gave you a million reasons why the guy is a piece of shit
[2017-01-27 00:43:07 UTC] cornhorlio: All I heard was that he talked shit about you on stream, i dont know if he has dont anyhting in the past
[2017-01-27 00:43:13 UTC] darksydephil: the only reason we're talking about this is because he decided to insult me on his stream when i never, ever, EVER mention the guy and i'm not part of the FGC for how many years now? lol
[2017-01-27 00:43:18 UTC] cornhorlio: Phil again like I said, I dont know whats going on between you guys

[2017-01-27 19:42:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil's commentary and observations should negate the boring gameplay (if the game is boring up to Chap 3)
[2017-01-27 19:43:04 UTC] neonbornspartan9: You cant always get what you want you know. At least I had fun with Re7 playthrough before something like Yakuza came up, and Phil likes it. Its all good.
[2017-01-27 19:44:00 UTC] bethe2670: phil likes yakuza though i dont so i find it boring and he finds it fun
[2017-01-27 19:44:14 UTC] bethe2670: resi 7 was fun to watch though
[2017-01-27 19:44:24 UTC] ornightz: Yakuza 0 picks up, you won't be disappointed

[2017-01-27 19:49:02 UTC] bethe2670: NotLikeThis
[2017-01-27 19:49:14 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :D you don't like that either

[2017-01-27 19:51:56 UTC] bethe2670: and i think you just started chap 2
[2017-01-27 19:52:54 UTC] darksydephil: well ok, let's hope chapter 2 is short then lol
[2017-01-27 19:53:03 UTC] darksydephil: the disco dancing was at least something silly/different
[2017-01-27 19:53:03 UTC] bethe2670: yep
[2017-01-27 19:53:31 UTC] bethe2670: that was weird as fuck especially the random guy dance battle
[2017-01-27 19:53:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the next DS3 dlc is released at the end of March,hope there is more of a challenge to this one as Phil blitzed the last dlc.
[2017-01-27 19:54:38 UTC] darksydephil: I blitzed it bc I'm way better at the game now lol
[2017-01-27 19:54:48 UTC] darksydephil: that final boss was very challenging but i was able to adapt quickly

[2017-01-27 20:00:53 UTC] bethe2670: under 30 i can tell cause its shit lol
[2017-01-27 20:00:55 UTC] darksydephil: yeah vsevolodeliseev i can say i'm very pleased with teh direct capture vids, doing them at 720p/60fps was the way to go. they look great on youtbe

[2017-01-27 20:06:37 UTC] bejeezus89: right he barely reacts to jumps cares lol
