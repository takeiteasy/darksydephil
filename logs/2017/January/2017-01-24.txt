[2017-01-24 07:07:18 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: @Argylegroove Yes
[2017-01-24 07:07:53 UTC] argylegroove: he must not have played for very long?
[2017-01-24 07:08:15 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: He has played for 2 hours
[2017-01-24 13:57:48 UTC] arrasa100: why he is salty :/
[2017-01-24 13:57:52 UTC] arrasa100: this is sad
[2017-01-24 19:05:11 UTC] kingjadvcmp: ahoy hoy, I missed RE7 last night - is it any good?
[2017-01-24 19:08:12 UTC] bethe2670: well the whole chat enjoyed it and phil enjoyed it so i'd say its good
[2017-01-24 19:08:28 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: Hi
[2017-01-24 19:09:08 UTC] bethe2670: crazy psycho girl like in evil dead chopping off arms and trying to kill phil with a chainsaw
[2017-01-24 19:09:49 UTC] bethe2670: then a crazy family stitches his arm back together and tries to infect him :D
[2017-01-24 19:10:50 UTC] kingjadvcmp: is the GAME any good, I was asking
[2017-01-24 19:10:54 UTC] bethe2670: then a epic garage fight with the daddy where daddy gets put on fire, car explodes near him and he gets shot in the face and the daddy is still alive
[2017-01-24 19:11:16 UTC] bethe2670: kingjad i just said what phil did yesterday
[2017-01-24 19:11:29 UTC] bethe2670: and if that isnt good then i dont know what is
[2017-01-24 19:11:32 UTC] kingjadvcmp: yeah I was asking about the game lol, I should have been specific my bad
[2017-01-24 19:11:45 UTC] bethe2670: THAT IS THE GAME
[2017-01-24 19:12:05 UTC] bethe2670: everything i said was about resident evil 7 lol
[2017-01-24 19:12:17 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well I read your first thing before commenting - again, my bad
[2017-01-24 19:12:37 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I responded to the first thing and typed without acknowledging the rest lol
[2017-01-24 19:12:48 UTC] bethe2670: ok
[2017-01-24 19:13:01 UTC] kingjadvcmp: so calm yer ham, ya bam
[2017-01-24 19:13:06 UTC] kingjadvcmp: all caps lock and stuff
[2017-01-24 19:13:07 UTC] bethe2670: i did say it was good in the first thing at the end though
[2017-01-24 19:13:26 UTC] bethe2670: hey i am calm
[2017-01-24 19:14:23 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I wasn't aware YouTube had a bugged views thing where they'd over-inflated people's views, they apparently fixed it last night or this morning
[2017-01-24 19:14:46 UTC] kingjadvcmp: it's weird how that kind of bug happens in the first place
[2017-01-24 19:15:22 UTC] bethe2670: i didnt know either but then i dont really check for that
[2017-01-24 19:15:44 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I only know cos socialblade mentioned it
[2017-01-24 19:15:53 UTC] bethe2670: ok
[2017-01-24 19:17:00 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Hitman escalation levels are fucking tricky lol
[2017-01-24 19:17:09 UTC] kingjadvcmp: nearly finished the Hokkaido one, on 5 of 5
[2017-01-24 19:17:12 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: The game is weird as hell
[2017-01-24 19:17:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you stayed up for the stream bethe?
[2017-01-24 19:17:45 UTC] bethe2670: yes it was a fun stream
[2017-01-24 19:18:01 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn that's dedication what time did it start 5am?
[2017-01-24 19:18:04 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: I took a sick day from work.
[2017-01-24 19:18:13 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob you watched the vids, yes 5am
[2017-01-24 19:19:02 UTC] kingjadvcmp: food for thought: would the European Phil viewers like Phil to stream earlier sometimes? Maybe at 10am Seattle time? It'd be 6pm in UK, not too late as you move further East in Europe etc
[2017-01-24 19:19:04 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you took a sick day to play the game or to watch Phil :P
[2017-01-24 19:19:22 UTC] bethe2670: i stayed up and watched wrestling till 4am and then killed a hour on youtube with music lol
[2017-01-24 19:19:37 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: Both, (I actually have the flu, so its valid)
[2017-01-24 19:20:12 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: Right after the stream ended at 3 AM from here, I went straight to bed
[2017-01-24 19:20:12 UTC] bethe2670: well at least you didnt lie
[2017-01-24 19:20:24 UTC] theycallmejimbob: for me the stream starts at 8pm and finishes at midnight KingjadVCMP so it isn't too bad.
[2017-01-24 19:20:28 UTC] bethe2670: 7am sleep time for me :P
[2017-01-24 19:20:36 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob same
[2017-01-24 19:20:48 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: I've only slept for 5 hours
[2017-01-24 19:21:06 UTC] bethe2670: :)
[2017-01-24 19:21:57 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: I'm currently trying to save up to move from here
[2017-01-24 19:22:59 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I gotta admire the stories of people who somehow move somewhere with like $5 to their name, and turn themselves into millionaires cos of an idea or something
[2017-01-24 19:23:07 UTC] bethe2670: phil still be fighting daddy :D
[2017-01-24 19:23:32 UTC] bethe2670: wish that could happen to me kingjad
[2017-01-24 19:24:01 UTC] kingjadvcmp: could happen to anyone IMO
[2017-01-24 19:24:13 UTC] kingjadvcmp: they just need a good idea and the willpower to pursue it
[2017-01-24 19:24:31 UTC] kingjadvcmp: most people struggle to have a good idea though haha
[2017-01-24 19:26:27 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: I really want Phil to replay Heavy Rain or Beyond before Detroit: Become Human comes out, but that possibly won't happened
[2017-01-24 19:31:13 UTC] kingjadvcmp: dunno what he'd gain replaying Heavy Rain, he knows story already so no element of surprise
[2017-01-24 19:31:49 UTC] senf0: any idea on the ETA?
[2017-01-24 19:31:56 UTC] kingjadvcmp: for whom?
[2017-01-24 19:32:10 UTC] senf0: for the stream
[2017-01-24 19:32:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: around half an hour
[2017-01-24 19:32:24 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well it supposedly goes 'live' in 28 minutes' time
[2017-01-24 19:32:41 UTC] clubsbabyseals: hello
[2017-01-24 19:32:42 UTC] kingjadvcmp: but gameplay could be another hour away at least
[2017-01-24 19:32:50 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey clubs
[2017-01-24 19:33:02 UTC] kingjadvcmp: it depends how much time Phil gives stream attendance to pick up and if he wants to vent on pre-stream about specific things
[2017-01-24 19:33:16 UTC] clubsbabyseals: what happens if phil beats the game today?
[2017-01-24 19:33:37 UTC] kingjadvcmp: smart play would be to experiment with VR mode if that happens, IMO
[2017-01-24 19:34:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: game is 11 hrs long according to HTLB so probably take 2 more streams to beat,think he is moving onto Yakuza 0 then
[2017-01-24 19:34:55 UTC] clubsbabyseals: didn't @DarksydePhil hate Yakuza?
[2017-01-24 19:34:57 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: @clubsbabyseals He won't, the game is 11 1/2 hours long. Trust me
[2017-01-24 19:35:12 UTC] bethe2670: i was playing kingdom hearts 2.8 final chapter prologue :D
[2017-01-24 19:35:34 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: @bethe2670 Is it good? I plan on getting it
[2017-01-24 19:36:07 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I laugh at the fact Square is charging full retail price for the prologue.
[2017-01-24 19:36:22 UTC] bethe2670: well is has a full game, a movie and a special episode for aqua set in cinderellas world
[2017-01-24 19:36:27 UTC] lemonplaysgames: SOrry, but a shitty back cover for an online game and a 5 year old 3DS game isn't going to cut it.
[2017-01-24 19:36:54 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: yikes
[2017-01-24 19:36:54 UTC] bethe2670: for 50 pounds that is a good deal
[2017-01-24 19:37:12 UTC] bethe2670: especially if you havent seen or played them
[2017-01-24 19:37:36 UTC] lemonplaysgames: bethe, they're basically telling you this prologue is worth just as much as the final release.
[2017-01-24 19:37:39 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Nuh uh.
[2017-01-24 19:37:41 UTC] bethe2670: i mean resident evil 7 is 50 pounds too
[2017-01-24 19:37:50 UTC] lemonplaysgames: RE7 isn't a fucking prologue.
[2017-01-24 19:37:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: did you get the limited edition bethe?
[2017-01-24 19:38:07 UTC] bethe2670: lol this technically isnt even a prologue
[2017-01-24 19:38:11 UTC] bethe2670: lol
[2017-01-24 19:38:14 UTC] lemonplaysgames: It is....
[2017-01-24 19:38:25 UTC] lemonplaysgames: the Aqua story takes place right after birth by sleep
[2017-01-24 19:38:42 UTC] bethe2670: yeah that is the prologue
[2017-01-24 19:38:50 UTC] bethe2670: not the 3ds game
[2017-01-24 19:39:01 UTC] theycallmejimbob: did you get the limited edition of kingdom hearts 2.8 bethe?
[2017-01-24 19:39:03 UTC] bethe2670: the movie also ties in
[2017-01-24 19:39:10 UTC] bethe2670: so its worth it
[2017-01-24 19:39:16 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Are you trying to tell me a cutscene filled back cover and a 5 year old 3DS game makes it worth 60?
[2017-01-24 19:39:24 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Fuck that.
[2017-01-24 19:39:45 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob no i got the normal edition or both kingdom hearts and resident evil
[2017-01-24 19:40:17 UTC] bethe2670: back cover is a MOVIE not a game so of course its going to be 'cutscenes'
[2017-01-24 19:40:28 UTC] bethe2670: its sort of the point
[2017-01-24 19:40:36 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I don't care what it is, it adds no value to what you're paying.
[2017-01-24 19:41:08 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I'm a huge kingdom hearts fanboy, and even I see this as a shitty practice.
[2017-01-24 19:41:37 UTC] bethe2670: i never played the 3ds game or saw the movie and i wanna bridge the gap of aqua story so its worth my 50 pounds especially when i usually play 60 - 70 pounds for FULL RETAIL
[2017-01-24 19:41:56 UTC] bethe2670: pay*
[2017-01-24 19:41:59 UTC] theycallmejimbob: its 35 pounds at base bethe did you shop around?
[2017-01-24 19:42:03 UTC] jackwhite2000: Hello everyone

[2017-01-24 19:42:27 UTC] bethe2670: yes
[2017-01-24 19:42:37 UTC] jackwhite2000: @clubsbabyseals its capcom what did you expect?
[2017-01-24 19:42:38 UTC] bethe2670: actually there is already dlc
[2017-01-24 19:42:40 UTC] bethe2670: i think
[2017-01-24 19:42:41 UTC] clubsbabyseals: did dsp get a season pass?
[2017-01-24 19:42:47 UTC] bethe2670: dont know
[2017-01-24 19:43:37 UTC] jackwhite2000: in 20 minutes there will be an injustice 2 stream

[2017-01-24 19:44:48 UTC] bethe2670: injustice 2?
[2017-01-24 19:44:54 UTC] jackwhite2000: no resident evil 7
[2017-01-24 19:45:01 UTC] bethe2670: of course it is
[2017-01-24 19:45:02 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: of course it is jack
[2017-01-24 19:45:10 UTC] rickgrimesfan123: thats normal for anygame
[2017-01-24 19:45:10 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @jackwhite2000, Resident Evil has never been known for its super complex, amazing plot, so it's not surprising.
[2017-01-24 19:45:12 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: duhh
[2017-01-24 19:45:18 UTC] clubsbabyseals: Hey did @DarksydePhil sign up for the Injustice 2 beta?

[2017-01-24 19:48:06 UTC] deltaforce355: kinda risky move

[2017-01-24 19:50:20 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: @theycallmejimbob To me, they are okay, but so repetitive
[2017-01-24 19:50:21 UTC] bethe2670: how does one spoil i never heard of this term

[2017-01-24 19:54:06 UTC] jackwhite2000: and lets not forget the ocasional paid reviews
[2017-01-24 19:54:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I thought it was good DeltaForce355 really enjoyed the jackbox game as well as choice chamber.He should do it more often
[2017-01-24 19:54:08 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: (Probably going to start a flamewar) Tf2 is still a classic to me
[2017-01-24 19:54:23 UTC] bethe2670: team fortress?
[2017-01-24 19:54:26 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: Yes

[2017-01-24 19:55:01 UTC] blue_blur64: Although it's usually either deathrun, jailbreak, or freak fortress :/
[2017-01-24 19:55:10 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: But TF2 inspired Overwatch
[2017-01-24 19:55:24 UTC] jackwhite2000: though everyone is playing as either scout or sniper
[2017-01-24 19:55:31 UTC] jackwhite2000: or engineer

[2017-01-24 19:56:27 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: @bethe2670 Overwatch is a great game! But TF2 is the successor and the classic
[2017-01-24 19:56:29 UTC] bethe2670: hey injustice 2 is great

[2017-01-24 20:21:36 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: HYPE
[2017-01-24 20:21:38 UTC] manyperegrine81: Is it a glitch from Twitch?
[2017-01-24 20:21:42 UTC] smward87: tank controls are when up is always the way you move forward despite direction you are facing. the other movement controls just spin you
[2017-01-24 20:21:51 UTC] lemonplaysgames: The people wanting fixed camera angles and tank controls are living in the past w/ their nostalgic glasses on. We do not live in the 90's anymore.
[2017-01-24 20:21:57 UTC] lemonplaysgames: We are not going backwards, lol
[2017-01-24 20:22:01 UTC] wingmaster19: @alexaponteftw now that was the name of the controls in the original
[2017-01-24 20:22:09 UTC] yacherdy: @LemonPlaysGames I agree.
[2017-01-24 20:22:12 UTC] jackwhite2000: no tank controls mean you rotate the character and then only after you rotate the character you can move
[2017-01-24 20:22:12 UTC] shotinthedeep: Lol. People still want tank controls?
[2017-01-24 20:22:13 UTC] wingmaster19: @alexaponteftw no*
[2017-01-24 20:22:17 UTC] yacherdy: Tank controls should stay dead.
[2017-01-24 20:22:22 UTC] 0megaj0ker: RE7 BOIS!!!

[2017-01-24 20:23:15 UTC] wingmaster19: @johnoshea22 i used tank controls on all they games of resi
[2017-01-24 20:23:22 UTC] alex_dragonul: What is happening i can't watch anything , there is no connection for me , only a whit blank screen
[2017-01-24 20:23:28 UTC] wingmaster19: @johnoshea22 that has tank controls that is
[2017-01-24 20:23:29 UTC] johnoshea22: if its fixed camera the tank controls hold up
[2017-01-24 20:23:31 UTC] lvlpower: resident evil hard difficulty should be automatically tank controls
[2017-01-24 20:23:35 UTC] jackwhite2000: @alex_dragonul refresh

[2017-01-24 20:24:08 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Yay :D
[2017-01-24 20:24:14 UTC] shotinthedeep: ....but without tank controls how do I get my character to walk backwards?
[2017-01-24 20:24:18 UTC] jackwhite2000: @Wingmaster19 oh god
[2017-01-24 20:24:18 UTC] lemonplaysgames: When I saw the first save room in this game, I leaped w/ tears of nostalgia.
[2017-01-24 20:24:20 UTC] alex_dragonul: I did multiple times , i will try to exit completely and start again
[2017-01-24 20:24:23 UTC] alexaponteftw: My overwatch update about to be done Kreygasm

[2017-01-24 20:25:05 UTC] blue_blur64: I found the best character for capture the flag so far is Sombra because of her teleporter
[2017-01-24 20:25:08 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I forgot about that refrence @Popsicolo
[2017-01-24 20:25:09 UTC] jackwhite2000: @Wingmaster19 silent hill is dead though :(
[2017-01-24 20:25:16 UTC] wingmaster19: btw wasn't there a rumor that the resident evil 2 remake demo was included with this
[2017-01-24 20:25:17 UTC] doctorzzz: i liked dva for capture

[2017-01-24 20:25:39 UTC] wingmaster19: @lemonplaysgames the classic save room music will always be the best
[2017-01-24 20:25:40 UTC] yacherdy: This score is great.
[2017-01-24 20:25:46 UTC] lemonplaysgames: That wasn't the question.
[2017-01-24 20:25:51 UTC] lemonplaysgames: The question was who else likes it?
