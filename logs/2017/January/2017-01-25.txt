[2017-01-25 03:05:11 UTC] goldencolts: why does a linear first person game need to be long? hl2 is one of the best games ever and people can speedrun it in like 20 minutes or something crazy
[2017-01-25 03:05:33 UTC] darksydephil: because this is 2017
[2017-01-25 03:05:53 UTC] oznolasenyah91: Because its 60 bucks lol
[2017-01-25 03:05:55 UTC] darksydephil: and when you can buy games that provide 20-40 hours of great content for $60, you need to provide an equivalent experience
[2017-01-25 03:06:05 UTC] suckasurprise: @DarksydePhil Did you see the Evo lineup that just got announced?
[2017-01-25 03:06:06 UTC] oznolasenyah91: I think the length of this game will be just right though
[2017-01-25 03:06:09 UTC] darksydephil: thats like saying a 20 minute movie is just as good as a 2 hour one despite paying the same amount of money to see them lol
[2017-01-25 03:06:26 UTC] trueandrrick: 1 st
[2017-01-25 03:06:33 UTC] darksydephil: Suckasurprise : i haven't cared about EVO for over 8 years. So the answer would be no, because I still do not care lol
[2017-01-25 03:06:47 UTC] shotinthedeep: People have done an emily dishonored 2 speedrun in under half an hour lol

[2017-01-25 03:10:14 UTC] darksydephil: i bet once you know where everything is, you can beat htis game in under 2 hours lol
[2017-01-25 03:10:20 UTC] goldencolts: eh it was a completely different dev, they probably just weren't as competent, mafia 2 was 2k czech and 3 was a california new corp
[2017-01-25 03:10:26 UTC] bkraft1993: They should have gotten better acting if it is a short game
[2017-01-25 03:10:50 UTC] jonsnow23456: the acting is fine
[2017-01-25 03:10:52 UTC] jkramer131313: Do you like this game Phil?
[2017-01-25 03:10:52 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Not even bothering w/ Mafia III, the grinding looked so boring.
[2017-01-25 03:10:56 UTC] bwt56: Did he kill that woman earlier I had to leave early last stream
[2017-01-25 03:10:59 UTC] darksydephil: RE1 had some crazy speedruns where you never fire a bullet until you absolutely have to, which is basically most of the game
[2017-01-25 03:11:00 UTC] carltonjunior: for what its worth this game is exactly like the oldschool REs but first person
[2017-01-25 03:11:28 UTC] popsicolo: There are people on twitter that think I'm trying to hide the fact that the fanart I made is literally ripped from a cartoon LUL

[2017-01-25 03:12:16 UTC] carltonjunior: the inventory management, the puzzles, the bosses, the level design, all of it is oldschool RE

[2017-01-25 04:11:28 UTC] shotinthedeep: He left because he couldn't record in high quality

[2017-01-25 04:48:54 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @Wingmaster19, Zombies would not fit story wise this far in the time line. They were originally supposed to be killed off in Raccoon City. Then Code Veronica happened, and then 6 happened w/ the forced "Oh, another virus has spread through the air."

[2017-01-25 04:49:59 UTC] oscargarza95: The thing is, resident evil was never really about zombies per se, it was about creating the perfect bio weapon, zombies were just the start

[2017-01-25 19:50:05 UTC] tenpiece32: is 60 dollars for a game you beat in 3 days a good game

[2017-01-25 19:50:14 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: @jackwhite2000 I didn't sign up
[2017-01-25 19:50:19 UTC] bethe2670: for resident evil it is a good game
[2017-01-25 19:50:21 UTC] jackwhite2000: i did
[2017-01-25 19:50:23 UTC] jackwhite2000: still no code
[2017-01-25 19:50:29 UTC] bethe2670: nope jack
[2017-01-25 19:50:34 UTC] jackwhite2000: but the beta is NA only
[2017-01-25 19:50:36 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: Its a close beta?
[2017-01-25 19:50:44 UTC] bethe2670: didnt sign up anyway
[2017-01-25 19:50:50 UTC] triolit: You are must know about Linkin_Simpson
[2017-01-25 19:50:53 UTC] jackwhite2000: so anyone from europe cant play it
[2017-01-25 19:51:20 UTC] tenpiece32: @neonbornspartan9 would seem like a rental or something I agree
[2017-01-25 19:51:23 UTC] neonbornspartan9: for res 6 yea, for this I doubt. no real point. only replayability portion would probably be choosing zoe or mia
[2017-01-25 19:51:25 UTC] triolit: He is a thirty year old virgin from Russia. Without a job for 10 years.
[2017-01-25 19:51:32 UTC] jackwhite2000: @bethe2670 were are you in RE7?
[2017-01-25 19:51:48 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: I signed up for the Mirror's Edge Catalyst beta, but I didn't get a code D:
[2017-01-25 19:52:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I think you dodged a bullet there Tyler :P
[2017-01-25 19:52:04 UTC] jackwhite2000: i think that beta too was NA only
[2017-01-25 19:52:08 UTC] triolit: And Linkin_Simpson was flirting with a twelve year old girl from Lithuania
[2017-01-25 19:52:08 UTC] bethe2670: im on the chainsaw daddy fight
[2017-01-25 19:52:19 UTC] jackwhite2000: cool
[2017-01-25 19:52:21 UTC] bethe2670: WHAT
[2017-01-25 19:52:28 UTC] theycallmejimbob: huh
[2017-01-25 19:52:28 UTC] jackwhite2000: im at the mia zoe choice
[2017-01-25 19:52:31 UTC] triolit: That Right
[2017-01-25 19:52:42 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: @theycallmejimbob I still got the game though, but it was a real disappointment
[2017-01-25 19:52:47 UTC] bethe2670: jack who to pick though
[2017-01-25 19:52:48 UTC] jackwhite2000: i chose mia
[2017-01-25 19:52:57 UTC] bethe2670: jack be getting the good ending
[2017-01-25 19:53:10 UTC] jackwhite2000: i mean shes the reason the events of the game happened
[2017-01-25 19:53:12 UTC] bethe2670: im not saying nothing other than that
[2017-01-25 19:53:12 UTC] iceyfletch: Kick both of them into the water and sell the serum to the highest bid
[2017-01-25 19:53:17 UTC] jackwhite2000: makes sense to cure her
[2017-01-25 19:53:31 UTC] neonbornspartan9: 60 dollars for a game under 10 hours is not worth imo.
[2017-01-25 19:53:43 UTC] bethe2670: choosing the wife or a daughter of a crazy fucked up family is a no brainer
[2017-01-25 19:53:45 UTC] bethe2670: lol
[2017-01-25 19:53:49 UTC] iceyfletch: That seems to be the way games are swinging these days.
[2017-01-25 19:53:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you can sign up to origin access for a month for 5 bucks Tyler_The_Drawer and play the game along with 20 others. Mustn't of sold well at all.
[2017-01-25 19:53:56 UTC] iceyfletch: remember the order?
[2017-01-25 19:53:59 UTC] jackwhite2000: back in the day games were 50 dollars and they were 1 hour long
[2017-01-25 19:54:15 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: @theycallmejimbob It sold well... Just didnt do good
[2017-01-25 19:54:19 UTC] jackwhite2000: so i dont see the problem
[2017-01-25 19:54:44 UTC] tenpiece32: well it seems they made it short so people would pay for the dlc
[2017-01-25 19:54:46 UTC] triolit: Are you hear me?
[2017-01-25 19:54:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yes TrioLit
[2017-01-25 19:54:56 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: @theycallmejimbob In fact, it was the 2nd best selling game in Europe
[2017-01-25 19:55:14 UTC] bethe2670: to me most games are in between 13-17 hours long, except for certain game like resident evil 7 but the reason for that is because of the VR
[2017-01-25 19:55:30 UTC] bethe2670: they think more than 10 hours in vr will fuck you up
[2017-01-25 19:55:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: wow Tyler_The_Drawer I didn't think it was too bad watching Phil playing it,just nothing remarkable.Strange EA added it to Origin Access so soon.
[2017-01-25 19:55:40 UTC] jackwhite2000: id rather have a 9-10 hour long awesome game than a 30-40 hour long boring game
[2017-01-25 19:55:43 UTC] triolit: It hunted in the real world. Hung fliers in the entrance.
[2017-01-25 19:56:07 UTC] iceyfletch: I think games like fallout are the perfect length
[2017-01-25 19:56:11 UTC] bethe2670: jack but witcher 3 and resident evil 7 are both epic games
[2017-01-25 19:56:14 UTC] bethe2670: :D
[2017-01-25 19:56:38 UTC] jackwhite2000: well there are some exceptions like the witcher 3
[2017-01-25 19:56:51 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: @theycallmejimbob The game was better then the first one by all means! It just was so disappointing
[2017-01-25 19:56:53 UTC] tenpiece32: @jack when you pay 60 bucks and finish it in 3 days how is that worth it
[2017-01-25 19:56:58 UTC] bethe2670: and fallout and the elder scrolls
[2017-01-25 19:57:02 UTC] bethe2670: and assassins creed
[2017-01-25 19:57:06 UTC] jackwhite2000: @tenpiece32 if i had a good time it was worth it
[2017-01-25 19:57:07 UTC] bethe2670: :D
