[2017-01-09 00:44:28 UTC] kodykarls: That's good news BloodTrail
[2017-01-09 00:44:28 UTC] darksydephil: and im coming up to some good stuff...pretty sure everyone wants to see the rematch of me vs blighttown lol
[2017-01-09 00:44:30 UTC] califlower: well i mean by fun, not views tbh
[2017-01-09 00:44:45 UTC] califlower: because capra demon is the most bitch boss in the game. it was to me
[2017-01-09 00:45:10 UTC] darksydephil: once i pass blighttown, everything will be new bc i never beat any of it legit before
[2017-01-09 00:45:14 UTC] darksydephil: so it's gonna be a wild ride
[2017-01-09 00:45:25 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: no death bligthtown
[2017-01-09 00:45:28 UTC] califlower: well, i will join to see anyways
[2017-01-09 00:45:37 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I believe in you
[2017-01-09 00:45:37 UTC] kodykarls: I'm very interested in seeing what your build/gear will be like by the end of the game
[2017-01-09 00:45:40 UTC] kodykarls: should be pretty fun
[2017-01-09 00:45:54 UTC] truth_commision: pretty chill stream, thanks Phil
[2017-01-09 00:45:55 UTC] darksydephil: im liking the spear a lot more honestly
[2017-01-09 00:45:58 UTC] darksydephil: allows me to play more defensively
[2017-01-09 00:46:21 UTC] kodykarls: that's true, lets you stay back so you can heal, if need be
[2017-01-09 00:46:27 UTC] darksydephil: i pretty much only used swords for most of dark souls except for II, which was very different lol
[2017-01-09 00:46:31 UTC] naddodr: remember, there's no respecing
[2017-01-09 00:46:40 UTC] naddodr: so every level matters
[2017-01-09 00:46:43 UTC] darksydephil: ive never really respeced anyway lol
[2017-01-09 00:47:11 UTC] kodykarls: It was the only one not rated M, and I still don't understand why they did that dspWowdude
[2017-01-09 00:47:16 UTC] califlower: well the spear isnt as awesome looking as the sword for sure
[2017-01-09 00:47:24 UTC] aleandspirits: BKUGS
[2017-01-09 00:47:37 UTC] naddodr: I'll admit, i'm a spear fanboy
[2017-01-09 00:48:00 UTC] darksydephil: so much to do tonight
[2017-01-09 00:48:14 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: ok?
[2017-01-09 00:48:16 UTC] darksydephil: the week in preview, messaging all patrons to get them their perks, then i have to film a q&a vid for a patron
[2017-01-09 00:48:23 UTC] darksydephil: then i have to do some personal shit
[2017-01-09 00:48:33 UTC] darksydephil: mostly bc i was gonna do some of that last night but...nope
[2017-01-09 00:48:43 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: ok well good luck with that!
[2017-01-09 00:48:54 UTC] kodykarls: being sick sucks :/
[2017-01-09 00:49:04 UTC] darksydephil: btw
[2017-01-09 00:49:17 UTC] darksydephil: IMO dark souls is far better than i even thought. i mean, weapon selection is totally changing the gameplay style
[2017-01-09 00:49:26 UTC] darksydephil: i had no idea you could block AND attack with a spear at the same time lol
[2017-01-09 00:49:44 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I dodn't know that either
[2017-01-09 00:49:47 UTC] kodykarls: it's pretty cool what you can find on your own
[2017-01-09 00:49:51 UTC] kodykarls: just by experimenting
[2017-01-09 00:49:52 UTC] califlower: i dont think it does as much damage though
[2017-01-09 00:49:55 UTC] kodykarls: and being open-minded :)
[2017-01-09 00:49:56 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: and I have played the game 93 hours or something
[2017-01-09 00:49:56 UTC] pel27: when is the next stream?
[2017-01-09 00:49:57 UTC] califlower: and stamina recovery is slow
[2017-01-09 00:50:31 UTC] darksydephil: just updated the title pel27
[2017-01-09 00:50:35 UTC] darksydephil: so now you know!
[2017-01-09 00:50:40 UTC] califlower: you should try switching in-battle to 2-hands and back to 1-hand, depending on the situation
[2017-01-09 00:50:41 UTC] naddodr: worth keeping in mind that a lot of weapons have a stagger animation if you miss
[2017-01-09 00:50:45 UTC] califlower: can be more effective
[2017-01-09 00:50:51 UTC] naddodr: but if you connect, it's fine
[2017-01-09 00:51:05 UTC] pel27: how come there are no night time streams?
[2017-01-09 00:51:22 UTC] califlower: people sleep at night?
[2017-01-09 00:51:35 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: phil has things to do also.
[2017-01-09 00:51:47 UTC] pel27: lmao okay
[2017-01-09 00:51:50 UTC] pel27: things to do
[2017-01-09 00:51:52 UTC] darksydephil: sometimes i do night streams
[2017-01-09 00:52:07 UTC] darksydephil: tonight i have too much to do, and for the next several weeks im working on edited series at night for my KOGaming channel]
[2017-01-09 00:52:09 UTC] darksydephil: !kogaming
[2017-01-09 00:52:10 UTC] nightbot: Be sure to check out my channel for game reviews, countdowns and more! https://www.youtube.com/KOGaming1
[2017-01-09 00:52:25 UTC] pel27: kogaming? I've heard about that before, what is it?
[2017-01-09 00:52:25 UTC] califlower: tbh if i were you i would only do 1 stream a day
[2017-01-09 00:52:26 UTC] darksydephil: nighttime streams will return later this month for sure
[2017-01-09 00:52:39 UTC] califlower: keeps people wantin gmore
[2017-01-09 00:53:09 UTC] kodykarls: double streams of hot playthroughs/new releases could work
[2017-01-09 00:53:43 UTC] califlower: then I would do 1 long stream
[2017-01-09 00:53:51 UTC] marcusdoesgaming: hmm
[2017-01-09 00:54:11 UTC] kodykarls: I think then it feels like a marathon for him, and he needs to eat/upload in the middle
[2017-01-09 00:54:24 UTC] darksydephil: ok folks, off to upload the new vids. thanks for a great stream, dont miss the week in preview tonight and see you all tomorrow!
[2017-01-09 00:54:24 UTC] califlower: 4-5 hours max isnt a marathon
[2017-01-09 00:54:34 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: right see you phil!
[2017-01-09 00:54:35 UTC] califlower: but yea dont know, it would be how i would do
[2017-01-09 00:54:36 UTC] darksydephil: im personally loving these DS streams so far, lots of funa nd people are not being horrendous dicks to me lol
[2017-01-09 00:54:49 UTC] kodykarls: sounds good, and yeah, what a surprise lol
[2017-01-09 00:54:54 UTC] califlower: well they are being dicks sometimes, including me, but in the end you provide fun
[2017-01-09 00:54:59 UTC] kodykarls: peace out, Phil & chat
[2017-01-09 00:55:16 UTC] califlower: end of the stream it is all for good fun
[2017-01-09 00:55:18 UTC] pel27: my friend got banned from chat today and I don't know why :(
