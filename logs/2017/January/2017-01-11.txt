[2017-01-11 19:45:32 UTC] bethe2670: he plays for 3 hours and a half but stream is 4 hours because of pre stream
[2017-01-11 19:46:56 UTC] deltaforce355: hi there bethe
[2017-01-11 19:47:02 UTC] deltaforce355: how are you doing?

[2017-01-11 19:48:14 UTC] bethe2670: yeah :(
[2017-01-11 19:48:39 UTC] theycallmejimbob: cahman bethe this redemption run has been great
[2017-01-11 19:49:09 UTC] bethe2670: only cause he died nearly 80 times already
[2017-01-11 19:49:15 UTC] aleandspirits: i hope todays stream is as good as yesterdays
[2017-01-11 19:49:49 UTC] bethe2670: i hope his weapon isnt OP cause i want more deaths
[2017-01-11 19:50:18 UTC] bethe2670: redemption my ass btw
[2017-01-11 19:50:27 UTC] richard_putt: Hello all.
[2017-01-11 19:50:31 UTC] theycallmejimbob: around 60 of them were beginners traps,slippery branches and due to columns bethe2670
[2017-01-11 19:50:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey richard
[2017-01-11 19:51:00 UTC] bethe2670: 60 hell no more like 45-50 were
[2017-01-11 19:51:03 UTC] deltaforce355: so 20 was legit deaths jimbob?
[2017-01-11 19:51:09 UTC] bethe2670: the rest were to bosses
[2017-01-11 19:51:18 UTC] aleandspirits: there will be plenty of deaths during this stream
[2017-01-11 19:51:19 UTC] deltaforce355: *were
[2017-01-11 19:51:19 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: All BK weapons in DaS1 are insanely stupid good and can be gotten at the start almost. So yeah but he will probably get rekt by alot of bosses regardless
[2017-01-11 19:51:20 UTC] dankedan: Stream plays dark souls?
[2017-01-11 19:51:34 UTC] bethe2670: yep lol
[2017-01-11 19:51:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: wrong channel dankedan this is the redemption run stream
[2017-01-11 19:51:48 UTC] dankedan: Lol ok
[2017-01-11 19:51:49 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: the BKS itself gets like 500 AR and more with 40str in one hand let alone two hand
[2017-01-11 19:51:59 UTC] deltaforce355: how so jimbob?
[2017-01-11 19:52:07 UTC] aleandspirits: BKUGS <3
[2017-01-11 19:52:12 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: Compare that to a plus 15 Battle Axe that is like 320 at max
[2017-01-11 19:52:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: is the sword he got from the dragon's tail OP too?
[2017-01-11 19:52:33 UTC] aleandspirits: they're supposed to be end game weapons
[2017-01-11 19:52:36 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: The gaping dragon?
[2017-01-11 19:52:43 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: Or the covenant dragon?
[2017-01-11 19:52:44 UTC] clesstheangel: the dragon greatsword or w/e
[2017-01-11 19:52:57 UTC] bethe2670: i just wish he didnt have a OP weapon i want him to struggle
[2017-01-11 19:52:59 UTC] aleandspirits: the likelihood ofgetting one at the beginning of NG is insanely low
[2017-01-11 19:52:59 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: I dunno probably most dragon weapons are besides drake which is just good for first half
[2017-01-11 19:53:03 UTC] aleandspirits: you have to be so so lucky
[2017-01-11 19:53:19 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: But he has probably the best one imo the halberd is insanely dumb because it has speed/fast recovery and damage
[2017-01-11 19:53:30 UTC] aleandspirits: it has whiff stagger
[2017-01-11 19:53:31 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he is still adjusting to not using a shield bethe2670
[2017-01-11 19:53:36 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: Atleast BKS is alittle less and stubbier and Axe/UGS have alot of recovery
[2017-01-11 19:53:40 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I got the Black Knight Sword at the beginning of my playthrough on NG as well.
[2017-01-11 19:53:40 UTC] deltaforce355: if this isnt a "legit" run, then what run is this called then?
[2017-01-11 19:53:47 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: Nah
[2017-01-11 19:53:59 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: Just have 5 humanity and you should get one DSP did get lucky with 0 though
[2017-01-11 19:54:02 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I just hate how you have to force yourself to use weaker weapons in order to have a fair battle sometimes.
[2017-01-11 19:54:04 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: So he had like a 10% chance
[2017-01-11 19:54:05 UTC] lemonplaysgames: On NG anyway.
[2017-01-11 19:54:09 UTC] bethe2670: delta its a redemption run not a legit run for starters lol
[2017-01-11 19:54:15 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I miss the spear he had :(
[2017-01-11 19:54:28 UTC] bethe2670: fuck the spear :P
[2017-01-11 19:54:32 UTC] aleandspirits: lol, humanity isn't that good
[2017-01-11 19:54:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: but the redemption run could be originally classed as a legit run bethe
[2017-01-11 19:54:36 UTC] aleandspirits: 1 humanity is good
[2017-01-11 19:54:38 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: Humanity raises drop odds
[2017-01-11 19:54:44 UTC] aleandspirits: but after that the benefits diminish by a lot
[2017-01-11 19:54:45 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: 5 humanity makes it like 35-40%
[2017-01-11 19:54:47 UTC] darksydephil: hello all
[2017-01-11 19:54:54 UTC] heigouxjustinwong: 4 makes it 30%

[2017-01-11 19:57:18 UTC] lemonplaysgames: You'll get better soon, just keep hanging in there.
[2017-01-11 19:57:59 UTC] ukyo9: Hello phil, Sorry to hear that about your throat :(
[2017-01-11 19:58:28 UTC] aleandspirits: i love gdq but twitch always craps out when its on
[2017-01-11 19:59:48 UTC] lemonplaysgames: The one thing I like more about Dark SOuls 2 than the original is that covenants won't punish you for leaving to level up other ones.
[2017-01-11 20:00:24 UTC] bethe2670: TIME TO PLAY THE GAME
[2017-01-11 20:00:27 UTC] aglet57: good evening
[2017-01-11 20:00:28 UTC] bethe2670: mwhahahhaha
[2017-01-11 20:00:38 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Like, sorry Quelana, but I have other ones that need progress!
[2017-01-11 20:00:45 UTC] deltaforce355: *plays cripple H theme*
[2017-01-11 20:00:57 UTC] bethe2670: :P
[2017-01-11 20:01:49 UTC] bethe2670: /me plays HBK theme
[2017-01-11 20:01:54 UTC] bethe2670: :P
[2017-01-11 20:01:57 UTC] deltaforce355: so i got timed out last stream for some reason
[2017-01-11 20:02:02 UTC] deltaforce355: 600 seconds
[2017-01-11 20:02:12 UTC] bethe2670: lol 10 mins
[2017-01-11 20:02:13 UTC] ukyo9: All caps, DeltaForce?
[2017-01-11 20:02:17 UTC] deltaforce355: nope
[2017-01-11 20:02:23 UTC] ukyo9: It's a mystery
[2017-01-11 20:02:40 UTC] ukyo9: When tons of haters are all writing crap, maybe you got caught in the storm?
[2017-01-11 20:02:44 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :( poor Delta
[2017-01-11 20:02:46 UTC] ukyo9: Yesterday was particularly bad
[2017-01-11 20:02:52 UTC] deltaforce355: maybe cuz i said "dont see the stream chat phil"?
[2017-01-11 20:03:02 UTC] aleandspirits: only phil tends to ban people
[2017-01-11 20:03:12 UTC] aleandspirits: so at least that wont happen!
[2017-01-11 20:03:15 UTC] bethe2670: im just a sexy boy, im not yo boy toy...
[2017-01-11 20:03:37 UTC] torosdemon: maybe the game won't be bugged today; it's so inconsistent so you never know
[2017-01-11 20:03:39 UTC] bethe2670: the mods ban the trolls too
[2017-01-11 20:03:49 UTC] theycallmejimbob: how you still here then bethe
[2017-01-11 20:03:51 UTC] deltaforce355: then im a troll too :p
[2017-01-11 20:04:02 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I only find it hilarious that people complain about him not interacting enough w/ the chat, and then people quickly try to defend themselves by telling him not to look at the chat if a spoiler happens.
[2017-01-11 20:04:02 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob because im not a troll
[2017-01-11 20:04:03 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: Nothing I can do
[2017-01-11 20:04:04 UTC] gergc5: where is dsp
[2017-01-11 20:04:06 UTC] wicked__clown: is he paying his "redemption run today?
[2017-01-11 20:04:10 UTC] gergc5: !soap
[2017-01-11 20:04:10 UTC] nightbot: Handmade glycerin soaps and wax tart melts from DSP's girlfriend, Leanna! http://www.etsy.com/shop/theblackcurrant
[2017-01-11 20:04:35 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: I've been experiencing some bugged banning mechanics tho, forrela
[2017-01-11 20:04:41 UTC] wicked__clown: more like stream tell's me what to do run
[2017-01-11 20:04:42 UTC] wicked__clown: again
[2017-01-11 20:04:43 UTC] deltaforce355: cuz its a "legit" run lemon
[2017-01-11 20:04:48 UTC] kuroriku: Well he said this was gonna be a no assist run so he should just minimize the chat to remove the temptation to look.
[2017-01-11 20:04:49 UTC] deltaforce355: anything else is fine
[2017-01-11 20:04:58 UTC] lemonplaysgames: What do you exactly mean by that though, Delta?
[2017-01-11 20:05:02 UTC] bethe2670: its not a LEGIT run
[2017-01-11 20:05:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: excuse you bethe2670
[2017-01-11 20:05:10 UTC] bethe2670: its a REDEMPTION run
[2017-01-11 20:05:18 UTC] deltaforce355: ok ok
[2017-01-11 20:05:24 UTC] gergc5: lol
[2017-01-11 20:05:29 UTC] deltaforce355: a REDEMPTION run it is
[2017-01-11 20:05:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the redemption run is a legit run bethe2670
[2017-01-11 20:05:36 UTC] torosdemon: ''''''REDEMPTION'''''' run
[2017-01-11 20:05:36 UTC] nightbot: torosdemon -> Please do not spam symbols, thanks. [warning]
[2017-01-11 20:05:42 UTC] lemonplaysgames: A spoiler is a spoiler, so if he can't look at the chat by playing a game (whether it's new or a redone playthrough of a game he hardly remembers), how is he supposed to interact w/ it then?
[2017-01-11 20:05:43 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob legit HA
[2017-01-11 20:05:50 UTC] bethe2670: this has been anything but

[2017-01-11 20:05:55 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Honestly, I have to defend Phil here, but he can't really win w/ these people.
[2017-01-11 20:06:04 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: lmao damn bethe is bringing the heat on
[2017-01-11 20:06:24 UTC] bethe2670: the only legit thing is no summons jimbob
[2017-01-11 20:06:43 UTC] deltaforce355: i agree with bethe here atleast
[2017-01-11 20:06:43 UTC] gergc5: $3750 dollars goal :D
[2017-01-11 20:06:55 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: True that though, all the other rules he made were broken before he left the tutorial
[2017-01-11 20:07:08 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no excuses bethe2670
[2017-01-11 20:07:13 UTC] jackwhite2000: Hello everyone
[2017-01-11 20:07:14 UTC] aglet57: I don't care if he asks for help. I don't need to see him wander around for 4 hours looking for stuff and raging.
[2017-01-11 20:07:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey jack
[2017-01-11 20:07:18 UTC] deltaforce355: hi there
[2017-01-11 20:07:54 UTC] gergc5: !goal
[2017-01-11 20:07:58 UTC] jackwhite2000: so hows it going?
[2017-01-11 20:08:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: good thanks and yourself jack?
[2017-01-11 20:08:14 UTC] deltaforce355: good. how's your day jack?
[2017-01-11 20:08:17 UTC] jackwhite2000: good too
[2017-01-11 20:08:34 UTC] aglet57: Think about it. If he just gets pissed for 4 hours looking for the next place to go, he's more likely to rage and want to quit. Then the walkthrough is over.
[2017-01-11 20:08:49 UTC] podusmonens: uh-oh
[2017-01-11 20:08:53 UTC] deltaforce355: walkthrough?
[2017-01-11 20:08:58 UTC] jackwhite2000: man i cant wait for may 16th
[2017-01-11 20:09:02 UTC] lokizarro: Yo
[2017-01-11 20:09:03 UTC] aglet57: playthough. Sorry
[2017-01-11 20:09:08 UTC] podusmonens: is the PT going south already?"
[2017-01-11 20:09:26 UTC] deltaforce355: hi there drain
[2017-01-11 20:09:26 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no podusmonens the redemption run has been a success so far
[2017-01-11 20:09:31 UTC] deltaforce355: *dragin
[2017-01-11 20:09:31 UTC] torosdemon: no it pretty much is a walkthrough
[2017-01-11 20:09:57 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: He's been backtracking a lot though. He could've taken Qualeeq or whatever as soon as he got to her, he just feels he needs to level more. Before he started backtracking he was making great progress
[2017-01-11 20:09:59 UTC] podusmonens: hey jimmy, delta
[2017-01-11 20:10:06 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey dragin how are you
[2017-01-11 20:10:28 UTC] darksydephil: nothing has gone south, lol
[2017-01-11 20:10:29 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: Time for more Dank Soup today. De Geso~
[2017-01-11 20:10:48 UTC] podusmonens: I'm good jim
[2017-01-11 20:10:49 UTC] darksydephil: the playthrough is doing fine. IMO it's a lot of fun to just explore in this game, regardless if i'm doing stuff "out of proper sequence" for peopel who have played hte game a million times
[2017-01-11 20:11:04 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i don't think he should be needing to interact with chat or pay attention to chat at all this run because chat's going to have a ton of spoilers and hints
[2017-01-11 20:11:07 UTC] ukyo9: The playthrough is pretty solid I'd say. Phil is doing tons of exploration and the lucky drop of the halberd that has everyone whining won't really change much, it's not like the game stops killing you in two hits
[2017-01-11 20:11:08 UTC] tofty1996: I've been enjoying it Phil, though as a souls vet it can be painful sometimes as I'm sure you expect, keep it up haha
[2017-01-11 20:11:08 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: Keep using them polearms bruh, represent
[2017-01-11 20:11:11 UTC] podusmonens: Phil someone was saying you're gonna quit
[2017-01-11 20:11:12 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: Also, Phil, the title is wrong.
[2017-01-11 20:11:22 UTC] radicaldreamer1: due what happened to the Zelda Playthrough? PogChamp
[2017-01-11 20:11:23 UTC] lokizarro: Do what you want man, only reason I've been trying to guide you a bit is because I want to see you try certain areas, but you'll get to them soon
[2017-01-11 20:11:23 UTC] podusmonens: I don't know enough about DS to judge
[2017-01-11 20:11:24 UTC] akioartorius: Today is Weds not tues
[2017-01-11 20:11:30 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: Today is WEDNESDAY, not Tuesday. Just letting you know.
[2017-01-11 20:11:32 UTC] radicaldreamer1: dude*
[2017-01-11 20:11:34 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @Ukyo9, Very true.
[2017-01-11 20:11:34 UTC] darksydephil: why would i quit? lol
[2017-01-11 20:11:40 UTC] gergc5: i did pledge $1 dollar to reach the $3750 patreon goal
[2017-01-11 20:11:42 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @Ukyo9, You still have to be good to not die, lol.
[2017-01-11 20:11:48 UTC] aglet57: he's not going to quit. this has been the best playthrough in forever
[2017-01-11 20:11:49 UTC] gergc5: R)
[2017-01-11 20:11:53 UTC] lokizarro: So Phil, how is Dark Souls 1 ranking for you so far in the From Soft games?
[2017-01-11 20:12:00 UTC] podusmonens: Twitch Prime AGLET57 : Think about it. If he just gets pissed for 4 hours looking for the next place to go, he's more likely to rage and want to quit. Then the walkthrough is over.
[2017-01-11 20:12:14 UTC] darksydephil: Lokizarro ask me that again when im done lol
[2017-01-11 20:12:19 UTC] lokizarro: You've been expressing a LOT of positives about it on twitter, even dreamt about Queelag lol
[2017-01-11 20:12:21 UTC] podusmonens: not my words
[2017-01-11 20:12:23 UTC] mrhuth: #FakeNews
[2017-01-11 20:12:27 UTC] solidnemesis97: Hey phil have you really had a dream about a creepy spider from dark souls?
[2017-01-11 20:12:29 UTC] aglet57: I was saying I people shouldn't care about the chat helping every now and then, Phil.
[2017-01-11 20:12:35 UTC] lokizarro: Will do @DarksydePhil
[2017-01-11 20:12:37 UTC] darksydephil: not a spider from dark souls, just a spider in general
[2017-01-11 20:12:43 UTC] akioartorius: "Beware of Chest"
[2017-01-11 20:12:49 UTC] bethe2670: hello dragin ugh
[2017-01-11 20:12:50 UTC] lokizarro: Ohh, right lol
[2017-01-11 20:12:53 UTC] bethe2670: LOL
[2017-01-11 20:12:54 UTC] solidnemesis97: oh ok lol
[2017-01-11 20:12:55 UTC] podusmonens: hello bethe
[2017-01-11 20:12:59 UTC] yacherdy: it seems everyone fails to mention Demon's Souls
[2017-01-11 20:13:07 UTC] bethe2670: ITS LIVE WOOO
[2017-01-11 20:13:13 UTC] gaylordbutthump: demon's souls is by and far my favorite of the series
[2017-01-11 20:13:20 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: Lmao we've been talking about DeS more than any other game, where have you been
[2017-01-11 20:13:25 UTC] gaylordbutthump: it's a shame it gets ignored so much
[2017-01-11 20:13:33 UTC] podusmonens: aglet I think people complaining about chat are mostly trolls. I dont mind
[2017-01-11 20:13:36 UTC] vokunkrahsil: hey phil how many times will you blow your nose today?
[2017-01-11 20:13:38 UTC] the_inkvader_squid_girl: @DarksydePhil I sent you some PMs on the Forums. When you have the time, I'd like an answer please. Thank you.
[2017-01-11 20:13:43 UTC] clesstheangel: according to BrightSydeViking, someone with gout is a goutist. LUL
[2017-01-11 20:13:44 UTC] nightbot: ClessTheAngel -> Now now now, that isn't nice! [warning]
[2017-01-11 20:13:46 UTC] yacherdy: @buffetcrayfish3 I just got here. I'm talking generally people never seem to mention Demon's Souls.
[2017-01-11 20:13:50 UTC] aglet57: @podusmonens I don't mind either
[2017-01-11 20:14:12 UTC] aglet57: @podusmonens I was saying that people complaining are wrong
[2017-01-11 20:14:13 UTC] gaylordbutthump: it's probably because DeS is a PS3 exclusive that not many people have played it
[2017-01-11 20:14:17 UTC] deltaforce355: poor cless
[2017-01-11 20:14:27 UTC] clesstheangel: lol stupid bot
[2017-01-11 20:14:31 UTC] yacherdy: I swear casual fans think DS is the first Souls game.
[2017-01-11 20:14:31 UTC] gaylordbutthump: plus atlus being in charge of NA localization probably didn't help. atlus doesn't have nearly the reach that Bamco does
[2017-01-11 20:14:35 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: @YaCherdy We seem to talk about it here a lot. Personally its the first one I've played and I ucking loved it. Beat DaS or the first time last week and I have to admit compared to DeS its a -10.
[2017-01-11 20:14:38 UTC] humpiershaggy: Hey guys!
[2017-01-11 20:14:46 UTC] bethe2670: demon souls sucks, dark souls 1 sucks, dark souls 2 sucks, dark souls 3 sucks, bloodborne sucks and nioh is going to suck ass
[2017-01-11 20:14:51 UTC] kellogs121: I thought the stream started at 3pm EST? is this a break?
[2017-01-11 20:14:56 UTC] deltaforce355: you were lucky cless

[2017-01-11 20:15:01 UTC] gaylordbutthump: no need to be so negative man
[2017-01-11 20:15:01 UTC] yacherdy: @bethe wow d00d
[2017-01-11 20:15:01 UTC] amocoru: Bloodborne is still he best game on PS4 IMO
[2017-01-11 20:15:05 UTC] bethe2670: thats my thoughts on all of them
[2017-01-11 20:15:06 UTC] thermocrius: just late, I think?

[2017-01-11 20:15:22 UTC] bethe2670: cless because of the deaths

[2017-01-11 20:15:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: we know your thoughts on the Souls games bethe2670 you have repeatedly said every stream you don't like em, we get it now :P
[2017-01-11 20:15:40 UTC] clesstheangel: let's be honest, we're all here to see the deaths bethe, lol

[2017-01-11 20:16:05 UTC] yacherdy: Guys I think BeThe hates the Souls series. Just a guess.
[2017-01-11 20:16:10 UTC] humpiershaggy: In your opinion, which is fine. Theres no need to go on about how much you hate them every single god damn stream. We get the message.
[2017-01-11 20:16:11 UTC] bethe2670: i like RAAGE and him dying a lot
[2017-01-11 20:16:12 UTC] stalkerstein: the souls games don't suck
[2017-01-11 20:16:14 UTC] akioartorius: The deaths and to see how phil does compare to his first run
[2017-01-11 20:16:16 UTC] nazgorg: hey who is this bethe2670? that some sort of an inside joke?>
[2017-01-11 20:16:17 UTC] stalkerstein: the community does though at times
[2017-01-11 20:16:20 UTC] kidsolano: Heyyyy
[2017-01-11 20:16:42 UTC] bethe2670: im no joke
[2017-01-11 20:16:44 UTC] khawaja7: i dont like 2d games because i suck at them
[2017-01-11 20:16:45 UTC] gaylordbutthump: the first run was great to watch, the one he did back in 2011
[2017-01-11 20:16:49 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bethe2670, is beth she is one of Phil's biggest fans Nazgorg

[2017-01-11 20:24:12 UTC] rayabusa: 1 is the ebst
[2017-01-11 20:24:15 UTC] rayabusa: best
[2017-01-11 20:24:16 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @kellogs121, the 60 fps mod is a great fix, don't get me wrong, but it's far from perfect. It definitely doesn't stay at 60 the entire game. I've had issues with it chugging in places like Demon Ruins and such.
[2017-01-11 20:24:20 UTC] podusmonens: he is currently at the restroom

[2017-01-11 20:26:00 UTC] kuroriku: the only drawback to the 60fps fix is weapons degrade faster and jumps are weird / hard to make.
[2017-01-11 20:26:01 UTC] deltaforce355: just piss it on dragin
[2017-01-11 20:26:19 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @kuroriku, Right, because the game wasn't coded around that framerate.
[2017-01-11 20:26:23 UTC] kuroriku: but for jumps, you just turn it off, jump, and back again.
[2017-01-11 20:26:24 UTC] podusmonens: ?

But w/o a good CPU to help chug it through, it's almost pointless. You start experiencing bottlenecking, which isn't good. A good CPU is just as needed as a good GPU./
