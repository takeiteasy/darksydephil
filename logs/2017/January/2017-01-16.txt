[2017-01-16 00:05:36 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @sipuli91 Lol, quit your lying. DSfix isn't perfect and no where near runs this game in perfect 60 fps the entire game.

[2017-01-16 00:05:52 UTC] bethe2670: bobbi it still counts as a boss though

[2017-01-16 00:06:01 UTC] gaylordbutthump: that's if he can dodge the attacks
[2017-01-16 00:06:05 UTC] bobbi_ling: this is harder than bed of chaos imo
[2017-01-16 00:06:08 UTC] quadlockz: still keep it to yourself jesus. Ok we get it you know how to play the game, but this is a redmtion run, not @akioartorius personal hand holding runthrough

[2017-01-16 00:06:14 UTC] nalfylatino87: @Sipuli91 I never dropped frames at this part on PC with DSfix although I turned on fullscreen instead of windowed as it was making the game stutter at times
[2017-01-16 00:06:15 UTC] sigrseli: @LemonPlaysGames, not full truth, game is choppy but like 5% instead of 70% on console

[2017-01-16 00:07:11 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @nalfylatino87 When he does his curse crystal attack that floods the entire area, the game drops heavily in frames. You'd have to be lying to deny that.

[2017-01-16 00:09:01 UTC] nalfylatino87: @LemonPlaysGames Yeah it might have dropped a few frames although I couldn't tell as I was trying to kill the boss. I did overclock my 6700K to like 4.9ghz so maybe that helped. Also I noticed the game kept dropping more frames in fullscreen windowed but fullscreen fixed it for me with the stutter

[2017-01-16 20:17:21 UTC] nerv117: who gives a fuck if i told him about the ring gwyndolyn is optional anyway.

[2017-01-16 20:23:28 UTC] beanie5181: !uptime
[2017-01-16 20:23:29 UTC] tengu_stoner: new londo sucks cause of no bonfire and the shitty ghosts that attack you through the walls
[2017-01-16 20:23:30 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Four Kings might give you a challenge Phil, but who knows :p New Londo is pretty annoying w/ the ghosts though.
[2017-01-16 20:23:32 UTC] darkcookie2809: who complains all the time?
[2017-01-16 20:23:41 UTC] bethe2670: wait actually i think gwyndolyn is before the demon ruins, lol i can remember what phil said haha
[2017-01-16 20:23:41 UTC] lemonplaysgames: They can go through anything, and once they gang up, they become a pain to kill.
[2017-01-16 20:24:07 UTC] wubegg: new subscriber badges? PogChamp

[2017-01-16 20:24:15 UTC] raptorbread: I became really good at soul's games, but the bed of chaos made me quit dark souls for about year. I only beat it after I'd beaten Dark souls 2
[2017-01-16 20:24:27 UTC] bethe2670: lol
[2017-01-16 20:24:28 UTC] taurusoxford: The ghosts have a good chance to drop transient curses though

[2017-01-16 22:21:05 UTC] eternalrains: How does not wanting a laggy stream make people entitled?
[2017-01-16 22:21:08 UTC] raptorbread: RIP
[2017-01-16 22:21:09 UTC] coldkiller86: but you wen ahead and went straight to insulting your fans for helping you
[2017-01-16 22:21:10 UTC] lucasmical: floeFail
[2017-01-16 22:21:14 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil is this a good use of your break? I assume you are aware that the video was laggy towards the end, I trust you're talking to twitch to rectify this.
[2017-01-16 22:21:14 UTC] bammbino: @mr_vidar_viking, find a dark souls blacksmith and upgrade your hammer to a +9 so you can start the banning
[2017-01-16 22:21:16 UTC] bethe2670: hmm
[2017-01-16 22:21:18 UTC] darksydephil: Cless is an idiot. anyone who spends time with a group that solely hates on a single person is an idiot
[2017-01-16 22:21:20 UTC] retrocerberus: dspGlitch time to.. take out.. THE TRASH!
[2017-01-16 22:21:25 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: haha

[2017-01-16 22:21:36 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @Reflegacy, Where can I find this information? The game says otherwise.
[2017-01-16 22:21:39 UTC] raptorbread: I have a strong hatred for Kevin James.
[2017-01-16 22:21:40 UTC] darksydephil: KingjadVCMP , um, i have no clout with twitch. sorry, if it's f'ed up, it's f'ed up and it's their fault
[2017-01-16 22:22:02 UTC] wakeupbreakfast: instead of calling your fans idiots shouldnt you be finishing scarface
[2017-01-16 22:22:11 UTC] kinggoken: he didn't call fans idiots...
[2017-01-16 22:22:11 UTC] encelor: alright phil take your break :)
[2017-01-16 22:22:12 UTC] winderfiend764: Clout... rarely hear that word
[2017-01-16 22:22:14 UTC] hodge__podge: lol
[2017-01-16 22:22:18 UTC] raptorbread: CLOD
[2017-01-16 22:22:19 UTC] darksydephil: more than likely, twitch has some big event or something going on and it's killing the site's bandwidth
[2017-01-16 22:22:26 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @raptorbread Ricky Gervais is worse
[2017-01-16 22:22:31 UTC] retrocerberus: he got deleteded dspGlitch
[2017-01-16 22:22:32 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil - would you ever do a redemption run of GTA San Andreas, without cheats to finish it? Can argue it was not legit.
[2017-01-16 22:22:38 UTC] xxalex2394: GO EAT SOMETHING PHIL IGNORE THEM
[2017-01-16 22:22:42 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: do they throttle their less desirables or somethihng?
[2017-01-16 22:22:43 UTC] somefatguysarm: AGDQ just ended so probably not
[2017-01-16 22:22:47 UTC] shotinthedeep: The stream seemed to work good once you restarted it. It's only right before you ended it that it started acting up again. Don't know what it is though
[2017-01-16 22:22:51 UTC] darksydephil: didn't i only cheat during the final mission of san andreas? i honestly dont remember
[2017-01-16 22:22:51 UTC] winderfiend764: Don't cheats make it impossible to finish?
[2017-01-16 22:22:51 UTC] raptorbread: Restarting the stream actually seemed to help
[2017-01-16 22:22:53 UTC] lightweightbro: GTA SA is boring
[2017-01-16 22:22:53 UTC] raptorbread: Yeh
[2017-01-16 22:22:57 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Bridge Esports show going on on twitch front page
[2017-01-16 22:22:59 UTC] lonewolfwarrior93x: Like when there's an LoL stream, all of Twitch's servers are redirected so its flawless.
[2017-01-16 22:23:12 UTC] soulrider95: Wait you cheat in a GTA game? LUL
[2017-01-16 22:23:12 UTC] darksydephil: oh, a promoted esports show. thats exactly what it is thenf olks
[2017-01-16 22:23:13 UTC] retrocerberus: Phil you should tell them.. "Boy.. you outta time!" DansGame and BAM
[2017-01-16 22:23:18 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, i noticed that retention in viewership has been better for you when you play one game to beat it and move on.. (this game is an example right now) any chance you may adopt this method ? i think it will be a success
[2017-01-16 22:23:19 UTC] naddodr: these morons will now return to their caves, complain to their friends and then those friends will come here, like "why are people banned for criticism"
[2017-01-16 22:23:25 UTC] darksydephil: that's the problem with twitch, they give all the priority to their promoted events and screw the little guys
[2017-01-16 22:23:26 UTC] reflegacy: @LemonPlaysGames Quelana will tell you that the bug is her after ascending your flame to max
[2017-01-16 22:23:36 UTC] superslygaming: PogChamp bridge exports I gtg
[2017-01-16 22:23:37 UTC] darksydephil: Bammbino its because of what game this is, lol

[2017-01-16 22:23:44 UTC] wan_ki_moon: I think he's only doing redempttion runs of games that he was really bad at
[2017-01-16 22:23:54 UTC] lonewolfwarrior93x: eSports, League of Legends, Overwatch (maybe) b/c that's where the money is apparently.
[2017-01-16 22:23:57 UTC] raptorbread: League of Legends is fucking dumb
[2017-01-16 22:23:57 UTC] royal_phalanx91: There's 6 promoted streams right now on the front page
[2017-01-16 22:24:00 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @Reflegacy, Ah okay, I was always lead to believe the girl was the Witch. Interesting.
[2017-01-16 22:24:10 UTC] raptorbread: Overwatch is a trash game.
[2017-01-16 22:24:11 UTC] lightweightbro: dude did someone just fart
[2017-01-16 22:24:14 UTC] punishedmac: There's always promoted streams on the front page, doesn't make a difference
[2017-01-16 22:24:16 UTC] retrocerberus: phil you should attempt a speedrun
[2017-01-16 22:24:21 UTC] n0_h3r0: @raptorbread, TRIGGERED

[2017-01-16 22:24:49 UTC] kinggoken: i'd watch that too
[2017-01-16 22:24:51 UTC] lergen1: @DarksydePhil fuck what the haters say. You're bad at videogames, and sometimes an ass but I genuinely find you amusing.
[2017-01-16 22:24:51 UTC] encelor: i love and hate demon souls
[2017-01-16 22:24:53 UTC] bammbino: that game was a nightmare for me
[2017-01-16 22:25:08 UTC] kinggoken: dsps haters have way to much time on their hands
[2017-01-16 22:25:11 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Get me a job with Twitch so I can fix their website Kappa
[2017-01-16 22:25:15 UTC] ado17x: Chat what made him comeback to twitch?

[2017-01-16 22:25:19 UTC] retrocerberus: If I may be so bold to ask.. a MGR redemption run?
[2017-01-16 22:25:21 UTC] bethe2670: good one royal
[2017-01-16 22:25:21 UTC] bbt_2016: phils not bad at games smh...
[2017-01-16 22:25:24 UTC] indicansent: @lergen1 Well he's certainly bad at a certain Street Fighter game ;)
[2017-01-16 22:25:26 UTC] encelor: the grind for demons ouls is just ridiculous
[2017-01-16 22:25:33 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: his fans told him to come back to twitch
[2017-01-16 22:25:35 UTC] bammbino: @Ado17x, alot of us bothered him aqbout it for 2 years
[2017-01-16 22:25:36 UTC] coldkiller86: im not a hater im just Enetertained buy the lack sommon sence somtimes
[2017-01-16 22:25:41 UTC] bethe2670: phil is good at games when he wants to be
[2017-01-16 22:25:54 UTC] bethe2670: otherwise he is either bad or ok
[2017-01-16 22:25:54 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well I'm trying to establish what else could be deemed 'fake' or 'not legit', since Phil considered this playthrough not legit before returning to it. What other games has Phil not 'legit' beat, in his own opinion anyway? There's been games he's used some cheats to finish with (GTA 3, San Andreas?) for a start, but who knows if there'd be high demand for that. There's also the S-word game which had a huge amount of cheating lol but Phil's kinda sworn off that
[2017-01-16 22:25:55 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Phil was good at Titanfall
[2017-01-16 22:25:59 UTC] lightweightbro: Phils not bad at games, the games just don't do well when he plays Kappa
[2017-01-16 22:25:59 UTC] wan_ki_moon: his worst playthroughs are MGS3 RE4 and black mesa
[2017-01-16 22:26:00 UTC] bulletheadhd: @bbt_2016 you're right. bad is an understatement
[2017-01-16 22:26:01 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I have a feeling Philly is going to steam roll Artorias, Kalameet & Manus.
[2017-01-16 22:26:03 UTC] weirdbutt: and by certain street fighter game you mean all of them AMIRITE?!
[2017-01-16 22:26:06 UTC] fattyboy067: I'd like to see a W101 playthrough but knowing him, he'll trash it pretty hard
[2017-01-16 22:26:11 UTC] lergen1: @indiacansent hes bad at everything but doesn't mean dude can't be entertaining
[2017-01-16 22:26:13 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: TLDR kingjad
[2017-01-16 22:26:18 UTC] encelor: is it true that phil is pupulair at 4chan?
[2017-01-16 22:26:18 UTC] redrizla: @wan_ki_moon, Don't forget Jak 2
[2017-01-16 22:26:18 UTC] bethe2670: WALL OF TEXT WutFace
[2017-01-16 22:26:20 UTC] bammbino: @Ado17x, i respected his choice to have his own chat and what not.. but ive been part of twitch since early JTV days so i and many fans wont give up on this site
[2017-01-16 22:26:20 UTC] retrocerberus: I thought RE4 was all right
[2017-01-16 22:26:21 UTC] ado17x: For income purposes twitch is where it's at imo
[2017-01-16 22:26:24 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it was actually a good post tbf
[2017-01-16 22:26:25 UTC] kinggoken: dsp are you getting the Nintendo switch?
[2017-01-16 22:26:26 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @re
[2017-01-16 22:26:26 UTC] bulletheadhd: @lemonplaysgames remember it's phil you're talking about here
[2017-01-16 22:26:28 UTC] kingjadvcmp: sorry if your attention spans are too short
[2017-01-16 22:26:29 UTC] kinggoken: I bet he is afk now lol

[2017-01-16 22:26:45 UTC] the_mother: So where is he up to?
[2017-01-16 22:26:48 UTC] retrocerberus: out of all the playthroughs New vegas is Phil's best original pt
[2017-01-16 22:26:52 UTC] indicansent: wall of text isn't popular on stream chats
[2017-01-16 22:26:54 UTC] bethe2670: so he is getting it
[2017-01-16 22:26:55 UTC] bbt_2016: phil is good at games tbh youtubers like game grumps/ radbrad are bad
[2017-01-16 22:26:55 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @RetroCerberus he was shit at most of it and got the chat to tell him secret locations
[2017-01-16 22:26:58 UTC] kinggoken: did he say what games he was getting for switch?
[2017-01-16 22:27:00 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I honestly don't know what a turbobadge is and means
[2017-01-16 22:27:01 UTC] encelor: @bethe2670 switch is 300 $ right?
[2017-01-16 22:27:02 UTC] winderfiend764: But he killed Cass
[2017-01-16 22:27:02 UTC] indicansent: i did read it all tho

[2017-01-16 22:27:07 UTC] weirdbutt: 4chan could care less about phil
[2017-01-16 22:27:11 UTC] bammbino: @Ado17x, i agree, i know tons of YTubers that flat out make more money on twitch cause of YT fucking with CPM and ad revenue for their gains
[2017-01-16 22:27:13 UTC] kinggoken: switch is 300
[2017-01-16 22:27:15 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well the short version is, what other games has Phil not legit beat? Aside from GTA3, San Andreas and the S-word game?
[2017-01-16 22:27:16 UTC] bethe2670: zelda and mario late rin the year
[2017-01-16 22:27:21 UTC] bethe2670: encelor yes
[2017-01-16 22:27:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Zelda is the only one I seen him mention Kinggoken
[2017-01-16 22:27:24 UTC] lightweightbro: the best playthrough phil ever did is the first silent hill :)
[2017-01-16 22:27:24 UTC] encelor: nice i might get one for zelda then
[2017-01-16 22:27:25 UTC] retrocerberus: Ok, i don't remember RE4 that good, Heavy Rain is all right

[2017-01-16 22:27:43 UTC] kinggoken: hmm Zelda. That should be fun.
[2017-01-16 22:27:51 UTC] royal_phalanx91: During his last playthrough of Dark souls he was pretty bad, got fans to do all the fighting for him using summons
[2017-01-16 22:27:51 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Not sure if the S-word game is a banned word or not in chat....
[2017-01-16 22:27:54 UTC] ziibrah: lost izalith or whatever
[2017-01-16 22:27:54 UTC] encelor: @Snipertheladiesman lava area

[2017-01-16 22:28:04 UTC] lightweightbro: bed of chaos @Snipertheladiesman
[2017-01-16 22:28:04 UTC] indicansent: nah best playthrogh of DSP was either MGS, Jak 1 or Crash 2
[2017-01-16 22:28:08 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I mean I have seen the badge, but never question what it stands for

[2017-01-16 22:28:26 UTC] redrizla: I think it no ads or something
[2017-01-16 22:28:26 UTC] coldkiller86: Phil Should do a redemption run of Hitman cuz i have seen his vids and wow he didnt do great
[2017-01-16 22:28:27 UTC] lightweightbro: kill you old style? what does that mean
[2017-01-16 22:28:28 UTC] kinggoken: exactly. Just like yt red.

[2017-01-16 22:28:33 UTC] xxalex2394: phil please dont use vr for resident evil 7
[2017-01-16 22:28:35 UTC] gamerzim: @mr_vidar_viking, Paying for turbo gives you the badge, some emotes, and no ads basically.
[2017-01-16 22:28:38 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @mr_vidar_viking if you click on it it tells you. Its the same as subbing you just pay more
[2017-01-16 22:28:41 UTC] lergen1: @winderfiend764 what is it
[2017-01-16 22:28:45 UTC] retrocerberus: I think alan wake had potentional to be great but the story gets boring halfway for Phil's playthrough, I could never finish it all
[2017-01-16 22:28:47 UTC] indicansent: DSP is at his best when he plays old-school retro grames
[2017-01-16 22:29:01 UTC] bethe2670: subbing gives you a badge, no ads and emotes
[2017-01-16 22:29:03 UTC] kinggoken: I would like to see dsp return to street fighter

[2017-01-16 22:29:36 UTC] theycallmejimbob: 360 Hodge__Podge
[2017-01-16 22:29:40 UTC] indicansent: @LightWeightBro Plenty people watch them. Crash 2 got lots of stream viewers.
[2017-01-16 22:29:40 UTC] encelor: @Hodge__Podge its on console
[2017-01-16 22:29:42 UTC] hodge__podge: ok thanks
[2017-01-16 22:29:47 UTC] redrizla: @Hodge__Podge, 360 version so fps is what you would expect
[2017-01-16 22:29:53 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Phil should play XCOM 2
[2017-01-16 22:29:53 UTC] lightweightbro: only because of the rage @indicansent
[2017-01-16 22:29:54 UTC] gamerzim: @mr_vidar_viking, It's a Twitch benefits you could say.
[2017-01-16 22:29:57 UTC] yacherdy: They tweaked Turkish Royals

[2017-01-16 22:30:08 UTC] winderfiend764: Xcom yes please
[2017-01-16 22:30:09 UTC] indicansent: @LightWeightBro Yeah but that's part of the fun.
[2017-01-16 22:30:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: okey
[2017-01-16 22:30:10 UTC] encelor: turkish royals?
[2017-01-16 22:30:13 UTC] bbt_2016: i cant wait til phil plays SF2 on the switch a game hes badass at haters gonna be salty lol
[2017-01-16 22:30:14 UTC] lightweightbro: if he plays a normal easy old school game he doesnt get many viewers
[2017-01-16 22:30:15 UTC] encelor: airplain?
[2017-01-16 22:30:19 UTC] lightweightbro: its only the rage type games
[2017-01-16 22:30:21 UTC] rbreezay: What happened?
[2017-01-16 22:30:22 UTC] bethe2670: you get more emotes and another badge lol
[2017-01-16 22:30:23 UTC] yacherdy: Ciggy
[2017-01-16 22:30:24 UTC] rbreezay: Break?
[2017-01-16 22:30:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: is there a release date for that bbt_2016?
[2017-01-16 22:30:31 UTC] kinggoken: he is on break
[2017-01-16 22:30:37 UTC] kingjadvcmp: isn't the switch in excess of $600 or something if you buy everything for it?
[2017-01-16 22:30:39 UTC] indicansent: @LightWeightBro Exactly. Look at Dead Rising 4
[2017-01-16 22:30:41 UTC] kinggoken: he was actually chatting in the chat for a bit then vanished lol
[2017-01-16 22:30:43 UTC] bbt_2016: no jimbob
[2017-01-16 22:30:43 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I thought it was superfast people or something.
[2017-01-16 22:30:44 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob later this year lol
[2017-01-16 22:30:52 UTC] shotinthedeep: You can also choose the color of your name if you have turbo twitch
[2017-01-16 22:30:57 UTC] encelor: @KingjadVCMP switch cost 300 $
[2017-01-16 22:31:04 UTC] kingjadvcmp: but there's peripherals and shit
[2017-01-16 22:31:07 UTC] kingjadvcmp: which are pricey
[2017-01-16 22:31:08 UTC] bethe2670: yeah you can get more colours
[2017-01-16 22:31:11 UTC] bammbino: @encelor, he means with parts and accessories
[2017-01-16 22:31:15 UTC] encelor: ooh
[2017-01-16 22:31:19 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @kingjadvcmp Just buying the Switch, a normal controller and a video game to use the switch is well over 400...
[2017-01-16 22:31:19 UTC] indicansent: I hope DSP knows he has to pay for online on Switch too
[2017-01-16 22:31:23 UTC] encelor: don't know about the parts sorry
[2017-01-16 22:31:41 UTC] yacherdy: I haven't been sold on a Nintendo console since N64
[2017-01-16 22:31:43 UTC] bethe2670: you might get some bits for going turbo for free i dont know lol
[2017-01-16 22:31:49 UTC] kinggoken: online on switch will be free for a few months
[2017-01-16 22:31:54 UTC] snipertheladiesman: anyone know how many deaths he's at?
[2017-01-16 22:31:56 UTC] bammbino: i will ONLY buy a switch for pokemon and thats it! im 28 y/o and still wish for a full RPG experience in pokemon
[2017-01-16 22:32:01 UTC] redrizla: 146 I think?
[2017-01-16 22:32:02 UTC] kingjadvcmp: yeah I read that somewhere, it'll be free at first online
[2017-01-16 22:32:21 UTC] lemonplaysgames: lol, oh yeah, and pay to play online. Free for a few months...what a joke.
[2017-01-16 22:32:21 UTC] winderfiend764: 100+ maybe around 140s
[2017-01-16 22:32:23 UTC] wan_ki_moon: the way his channel has gone people now prefer to watch him rage then watch the gameplay thats why the *** videos get more views than his playthroughs that he uploas
[2017-01-16 22:32:24 UTC] encelor: @Bammbino pokemon series is going on to switch?
[2017-01-16 22:32:24 UTC] indicansent: @Kinggoken I heard it's just for the first month, the release month. Then you pay for it afterwards
[2017-01-16 22:32:26 UTC] lergen1: @bethe2670 "FREE"
[2017-01-16 22:32:30 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i just want mario, smt and metroid pretty much. maybe if there's some good exclusives from third party devs i'll want more
[2017-01-16 22:32:42 UTC] macmargera12: where is he
[2017-01-16 22:32:43 UTC] lemonplaysgames: They have noting to offer for an online experience that compares to other platforms.
[2017-01-16 22:32:43 UTC] gaylordbutthump: never paying for online though, fuck that
[2017-01-16 22:32:45 UTC] iconicmaster1: Smash 52
[2017-01-16 22:32:47 UTC] indicansent: Plus for SF2 he has to get the Pro Controller at least so that's $70
[2017-01-16 22:32:48 UTC] bbt_2016: bammbino switch is a 3ds replacement too so Pok√©mon has to be on it
[2017-01-16 22:32:52 UTC] iconicmaster1: 5
[2017-01-16 22:32:57 UTC] shotinthedeep: It's ad free, custom emotes, more colors, increased video storage, and turbo badge
[2017-01-16 22:33:03 UTC] lukeyrocks221: is this the guy that gets rekt in mortal kombat?
[2017-01-16 22:33:09 UTC] kinggoken: do you guys consider the Nintendo Switch to be a console or a portable?
[2017-01-16 22:33:10 UTC] bammbino: @encelor, i dont follow alot of pokemon news nor nintendo news.. but there is a rumor that pokemon sun / moon have been in developement for the switch
[2017-01-16 22:33:13 UTC] iconicmaster1: EleGiggle
[2017-01-16 22:33:24 UTC] iconicmaster1: Both
[2017-01-16 22:33:33 UTC] indicansent: $480 for it all if he gets Zelda on top of that
[2017-01-16 22:33:44 UTC] encelor: @Bammbino if its true that would be awesome i was tired of buying new handhelds all the time
[2017-01-16 22:33:46 UTC] indicansent: Assuming the games are $50
[2017-01-16 22:33:47 UTC] punishedmac: Beat Poniff Sulyvahn on third attempt on my SL1 character lets go boys PogChamp
[2017-01-16 22:33:49 UTC] bammbino: @encelor, if you look at the early videos pokemon released on their YT channel, you can see models in wireframes that dont look like 3ds quality
[2017-01-16 22:33:51 UTC] snipertheladiesman: @lukeyrocks221 yes lol
[2017-01-16 22:33:54 UTC] bbt_2016: switch is a portable
[2017-01-16 22:34:04 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @indicansent I love how they're calling it a "Pro controller" There's nothing Pro about it, it's a normal controller that gets included in every other system.
[2017-01-16 22:34:20 UTC] bammbino: can be portable, its still a weak home system which is still better than 3ds
[2017-01-16 22:34:38 UTC] indicansent: @LemonPlaysGames Lol yep; for me no Nintendo controller beats the wireless Wavebird anyway
[2017-01-16 22:34:46 UTC] encelor: i see switch as a gamecube dunno why
[2017-01-16 22:34:53 UTC] bammbino: my only concern for the switch is that they will be dickheads and make a XL, lite and all kinds of versions to milk their fans
[2017-01-16 22:34:54 UTC] cte900: i always buy consoles right when they come out and then wait for games. i think i'll buy it a year late this time so i don't have to wait for a library i want to play
[2017-01-16 22:34:57 UTC] yacherdy: I'll just stick to my PC
[2017-01-16 22:35:09 UTC] iconicmaster1: Joy stick looks like a cellphone with button and analog stick
[2017-01-16 22:35:15 UTC] lightweightbro: Poniff Sulyvahn is easy @punishedmac
[2017-01-16 22:35:31 UTC] indicansent: Pro Controller is overpriced; PS4 and XBO controllers are $60; Smash controller was $30 and has most of the same functionality as Pro Controller
[2017-01-16 22:35:40 UTC] bbt_2016: pontiff destroyed phil
[2017-01-16 22:35:50 UTC] lightweightbro: how many people are on stream right now?
[2017-01-16 22:35:52 UTC] gaylordbutthump: gundyr really destroyed phil
[2017-01-16 22:35:57 UTC] gaylordbutthump: 575
[2017-01-16 22:36:00 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I do feel this is Nintendo's swan song for a hardware company. My prediction, they're going full software after this.
[2017-01-16 22:36:05 UTC] encelor: pontiff ?
[2017-01-16 22:36:08 UTC] encelor: the pope?
[2017-01-16 22:36:08 UTC] bammbino: @indicansent, ps4 controllers are usually $45 or less on amazon! sometimes 50
[2017-01-16 22:36:09 UTC] sonicsanchez: 69
[2017-01-16 22:36:09 UTC] encelor: wut
[2017-01-16 22:36:10 UTC] iconicmaster1: Is Phil about to fight the boss

[2017-01-16 22:36:19 UTC] yacherdy: Kurt Angle in the HOF
[2017-01-16 22:36:23 UTC] yacherdy: my all time fav
[2017-01-16 22:36:24 UTC] bbt_2016: pro controller is only $10 more than a ps4 1
[2017-01-16 22:36:29 UTC] punishedmac: @LightWeightBro, Level 1, bro.
[2017-01-16 22:36:30 UTC] indicansent: I hope Switch does okay but it might do only about 45-55 million in sales, if they do everything right
[2017-01-16 22:36:33 UTC] bammbino: @LemonPlaysGames, i wished for that since ps2 days
[2017-01-16 22:36:35 UTC] kinggoken: Kurt Angle in wwe hall of fame?
[2017-01-16 22:36:38 UTC] indicansent: Which they won't
[2017-01-16 22:36:40 UTC] yacherdy: @Kinggoken Yah
[2017-01-16 22:36:41 UTC] kingjadvcmp: the breaks hurt Phil's numbers quite a bit I feel. I noticed it steadily climb more and more, but there's a huge drop-off for breaks. Shame Phil can't do much shorter breaks or something.
[2017-01-16 22:36:42 UTC] snipertheladiesman: @bbt_2016 that it did, i just beat lord wolner in DS3, really cool fun boss, phil calls him cheap and the worst boss in any souls game lol
[2017-01-16 22:36:51 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @bbt_2016 And yet, it's not included with the system -_-
[2017-01-16 22:37:00 UTC] gaylordbutthump: wolnir is easy as hell
[2017-01-16 22:37:03 UTC] lucasmical: lud and zallen are the worst souls boss
[2017-01-16 22:37:05 UTC] encelor: he shouldhave sold the wiiu instead of throwing it away
[2017-01-16 22:37:06 UTC] coldkiller86: @posicolo what is he throwing in the trash is it a wii?
[2017-01-16 22:37:10 UTC] popsicolo: Phil should do stuff with the greenscreen again now that he can.
[2017-01-16 22:37:12 UTC] kinggoken: I think the switch needs a better launch lineup
[2017-01-16 22:37:18 UTC] indicansent: @LemonPlaysGames It could be, but I hope not. I still want Nintendo to stick around. Already sucked when Sega got out of hardware, can't have Nintendo leave too.
[2017-01-16 22:37:25 UTC] bammbino: @LemonPlaysGames, it boggles my mind how nintendo thinks pokemon selling a bit under 10% of the 3ds userbase is a success
[2017-01-16 22:37:30 UTC] redrizla: @KingjadVCMP, I think Phil is the only streamer I've seen who does breaks like this. Others will just say "be right back guys" if they need to go the bathroom or something
[2017-01-16 22:37:32 UTC] indicansent: They're the last 100% videogame company left
[2017-01-16 22:37:33 UTC] lightweightbro: he probably wont @Popsicolo :/
[2017-01-16 22:37:38 UTC] iconicmaster1: Sonic went in the trash to
[2017-01-16 22:37:41 UTC] popsicolo: Eh, you never know.
[2017-01-16 22:37:45 UTC] snipertheladiesman: i havent died to a boss yet in DS3 and finding most of them either really easy and fun or enough of a challenge and still fun lol
[2017-01-16 22:37:55 UTC] bammbino: @LemonPlaysGames, release zelda, pokemon, mario and other first IPs to pc, ps4, and xbox for more income
[2017-01-16 22:38:00 UTC] matt_radartechnician: hellos
[2017-01-16 22:38:01 UTC] darksydephil: ok back
[2017-01-16 22:38:07 UTC] iconicmaster1: SeemsGood

[2017-01-16 22:38:17 UTC] lightweightbro: Phil would you ever do anything with the green screen again?
[2017-01-16 22:38:17 UTC] kingjadvcmp: viking don't piss yer little panties now
[2017-01-16 22:38:19 UTC] encelor: @Kinggoken pretty sure nintendo is gonna pull off a low quantity launch for switch so people will feel the exclusivity of it and buy it for 400-500$
[2017-01-16 22:38:20 UTC] shotinthedeep: wb Phil
[2017-01-16 22:38:22 UTC] psyoctopi: 30 min break
[2017-01-16 22:38:23 UTC] indicansent: @iconicmaster1 Eh; Sonic had its dark age but it's looking better now b/c of Sonic Mania
[2017-01-16 22:38:26 UTC] saintanti: is phil starting late today?
[2017-01-16 22:38:27 UTC] coldkiller86: please phil do Hitman Elusive Targets i want so se you do them
[2017-01-16 22:38:29 UTC] wan_ki_moon: Phil ilove you
[2017-01-16 22:38:31 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: you either kingjad
[2017-01-16 22:38:36 UTC] kinggoken: you are probably right @encelor
[2017-01-16 22:38:42 UTC] clesstheangel: Wanna explain why I was timed out for just saying the truth @DarksydePhil
[2017-01-16 22:38:48 UTC] popsicolo: ASMR PogChamp
[2017-01-16 22:38:49 UTC] matt_radartechnician: i wish i had money, love to make my chest smaller
[2017-01-16 22:38:50 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh boy
[2017-01-16 22:38:53 UTC] indicansent: @encelor They're not in a position to try and do that. They need all the sales they can get.
[2017-01-16 22:38:53 UTC] lemonplaysgames: They did that with the NES classic, wouldn't surprise me.
[2017-01-16 22:38:55 UTC] darksydephil: cless, keep it up and you'll be worse than timed out
[2017-01-16 22:38:58 UTC] akioartorius: Phil did do some of the hitman elusive target i think
[2017-01-16 22:38:58 UTC] bammbino: @Coldkiller86, idk if he will ever play it again after hearing his last words
[2017-01-16 22:38:59 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @ClessTheAngel what did you say
[2017-01-16 22:39:03 UTC] bethe2670: lol you are lucky you were only timed out
[2017-01-16 22:39:07 UTC] bethe2670: cless
[2017-01-16 22:39:09 UTC] iconicmaster1: @indicansent looking for to sonic mania SeemsGood
[2017-01-16 22:39:09 UTC] kinggoken: DSP laying down the law!
[2017-01-16 22:39:14 UTC] kingjadvcmp: poor Cless
[2017-01-16 22:39:14 UTC] encelor: @indicansent they did it with NES classic
[2017-01-16 22:39:15 UTC] lemonplaysgames: But @indicansent makes a good point, they can't do it.
[2017-01-16 22:39:15 UTC] clesstheangel: I just said that he was treating his fans like shit
[2017-01-16 22:39:16 UTC] lightweightbro: lol
[2017-01-16 22:39:16 UTC] skulljack17: Hey Phil. You have a chance to read that Email ever?
[2017-01-16 22:39:21 UTC] bethe2670: meh
[2017-01-16 22:39:23 UTC] indicansent: But it's Nintendo so they'll probably mess it up
[2017-01-16 22:39:24 UTC] humpiershaggy: Cless is still here?
[2017-01-16 22:39:27 UTC] kinggoken: how does he treat the fans like crap? explain
[2017-01-16 22:39:28 UTC] kingjadvcmp: observations are not allowed Cless, you know this
[2017-01-16 22:39:33 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @ClessTheAngel he does though
[2017-01-16 22:39:37 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Cless is not going to be in the corner
[2017-01-16 22:39:40 UTC] matt_radartechnician: if my boobs were DD i would be happy, but no, I have G-cups and my back is always in pain
[2017-01-16 22:39:41 UTC] zilthemill: True fans aren't being treated like shit.
[2017-01-16 22:39:46 UTC] snipertheladiesman: Favourite boss in DS3 go!
[2017-01-16 22:39:47 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: that isn't very nice cless. I don't agree with that
[2017-01-16 22:39:48 UTC] redrizla: Are you really that offended that he disgareed with you?
[2017-01-16 22:39:51 UTC] humpiershaggy: Flush the miserable douche
[2017-01-16 22:39:52 UTC] indicansent: @encelor True, but their entire business wasn't dependent on NES Classic. Their future depends on how well Switch does
[2017-01-16 22:39:55 UTC] bammbino: @ClessTheAngel, no need to try and white knight any of us fans.. we know when he his talking about us and when hes not
[2017-01-16 22:39:55 UTC] fattyboy067: final boss
[2017-01-16 22:39:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: lets do this
[2017-01-16 22:39:57 UTC] akioartorius: yes ready
[2017-01-16 22:39:57 UTC] skulljack17: What's a 'true' fan?
[2017-01-16 22:39:58 UTC] kingjadvcmp: viking, it's an opinion, you do not have to agree with it
[2017-01-16 22:39:58 UTC] bethe2670: he calls us idiots which i agree he shouldnt do cause thats not nice to hear from someone you are a fan of
[2017-01-16 22:40:01 UTC] humpiershaggy: atpToiler
[2017-01-16 22:40:01 UTC] gaylordbutthump: nameless king
[2017-01-16 22:40:06 UTC] clesstheangel: Hold on
[2017-01-16 22:40:09 UTC] bammbino: @ClessTheAngel, he has constant haters and he address them the most
[2017-01-16 22:40:10 UTC] iconicmaster1: We need a dark souls on the nes
[2017-01-16 22:40:24 UTC] skulljack17: I mean, what makes a fan a 'true' one?
[2017-01-16 22:40:35 UTC] yacherdy: Wait he called you all idiots? MingLee

[2017-01-16 23:34:01 UTC] nalfylatino87: @LemonPlaysGames True but the fact you can also change the internal resolution is amazing. Makes the game so much better. I played it my first time without DSfix though and was okay, but the 60fps fix with my 1080 was nice. How bad are the drops on your hardware?
[2017-01-16 23:34:04 UTC] popsicolo: What would that look like?

[2017-01-16 23:34:34 UTC] lemonplaysgames: All I've seen as far as facts go is this boss was originally supposed to be a full on boss, but due to issues/time constraints, they just wipped it up like this just to get it working. In short, it wasn't a finished boss.

The answer should come as no surprise to fans of the series ‚Äì it‚Äôs the lava/dinosaur nightmare known as Lost Izalith in Dark Souls. Miyazaki comments ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want to elaborate on this very much. There was a different person assigned to this area, and although I was involved, I don‚Äôt want to pose very many negative comments for his sake. It can be a learning experience for all of us.‚Äù
