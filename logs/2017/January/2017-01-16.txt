[2017-01-16 00:05:36 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @sipuli91 Lol, quit your lying. DSfix isn't perfect and no where near runs this game in perfect 60 fps the entire game.

[2017-01-16 00:05:52 UTC] bethe2670: bobbi it still counts as a boss though

[2017-01-16 00:06:01 UTC] gaylordbutthump: that's if he can dodge the attacks
[2017-01-16 00:06:05 UTC] bobbi_ling: this is harder than bed of chaos imo
[2017-01-16 00:06:08 UTC] quadlockz: still keep it to yourself jesus. Ok we get it you know how to play the game, but this is a redmtion run, not @akioartorius personal hand holding runthrough

[2017-01-16 00:06:14 UTC] nalfylatino87: @Sipuli91 I never dropped frames at this part on PC with DSfix although I turned on fullscreen instead of windowed as it was making the game stutter at times
[2017-01-16 00:06:15 UTC] sigrseli: @LemonPlaysGames, not full truth, game is choppy but like 5% instead of 70% on console

[2017-01-16 00:07:11 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @nalfylatino87 When he does his curse crystal attack that floods the entire area, the game drops heavily in frames. You'd have to be lying to deny that.

[2017-01-16 00:09:01 UTC] nalfylatino87: @LemonPlaysGames Yeah it might have dropped a few frames although I couldn't tell as I was trying to kill the boss. I did overclock my 6700K to like 4.9ghz so maybe that helped. Also I noticed the game kept dropping more frames in fullscreen windowed but fullscreen fixed it for me with the stutter

[2017-01-16 20:02:47 UTC] soulrider95: man these sub badges are kinda ugly at twitch size, probably shoulda had a transparant background
[2017-01-16 20:03:02 UTC] popsicolo: Yeah, I need to tweak them at some point.
[2017-01-16 20:03:04 UTC] soulrider95: at a glance they just look like smudges LUL
[2017-01-16 20:03:16 UTC] kg1772: yea the colors are kinda odd
[2017-01-16 20:03:18 UTC] auxitius: it's ironic
[2017-01-16 20:03:21 UTC] bethe2670: lol a shit smudge Kappa
[2017-01-16 20:03:23 UTC] soulrider95: They'd be fine without the background tbh
[2017-01-16 20:03:33 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: in any case they are a upgrade from the old one
[2017-01-16 20:03:35 UTC] nerv117: Kappa
[2017-01-16 20:04:01 UTC] popsicolo: The glow looks a little wonky scaled down. Looked better at size 72 and 36
[2017-01-16 20:04:15 UTC] akioartorius: So Phil is wearing some sort of strap while playing this game? Read his twitter...
[2017-01-16 20:04:20 UTC] kg1772: the background is an ugly color
[2017-01-16 20:04:21 UTC] popsicolo: Now that I know this, I can make corrections moving forward.
[2017-01-16 20:04:39 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: As I understand it he bought one to sleep with

[2017-01-16 20:08:25 UTC] bbt_2016: 👌👌👌
[2017-01-16 20:09:04 UTC] darksydephil: yeah the badge changes appearance depending on how big you have the chat set up on your device
[2017-01-16 20:09:18 UTC] darksydephil: on my desktop, its smaller, so it has the bigger glow. on my laptop i'm zoomed in and theres less glow
[2017-01-16 20:09:38 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: did you just change it?
[2017-01-16 20:09:49 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: now it looks much better

[2017-01-16 20:13:14 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @DarksydePhil, Just a note w/ killing Gwyndolin w/ your darkmoon seance ring, it'ss going to make the firekepper agressive towards you, the woman who stands by the bonfire in anor londo.

[2017-01-16 20:14:26 UTC] lemonplaysgames: It is indeed crpytic, even reading the description doesn't tell you anything relevant to hints towarsd it.

[2017-01-16 20:15:41 UTC] inthedarkarcade: Phil - could you unblock me @inthedarkarcade on Twitter - I have literally no idea why I'm blocked. I've never spoken to you or about - and it makes keeping up with your stuff on Twitch and Youtube hard :(

[2017-01-16 20:17:19 UTC] darksydephil: you could have been blocked if you were part of one of those retweeting storms from another YTer or something. if my twitter is getting mass spammed sometimes i have to take action
[2017-01-16 20:17:21 UTC] nerv117: who gives a fuck if i told him about the ring gwyndolyn is optional anyway.
[2017-01-16 20:17:44 UTC] bbt_2016: Just realized i only watch Phil on twitch so i'll never get my "Max Bandwidth" cheevo 4 watching 8 hrs straight 😢😢

[2017-01-16 20:17:48 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @nerv117, You know the trolls are going to make a big deal out of it, even though there's no absolute way to know unless you read messages on the ground or look it up.

[2017-01-16 20:23:30 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Four Kings might give you a challenge Phil, but who knows :p New Londo is pretty annoying w/ the ghosts though.
[2017-01-16 20:23:32 UTC] darkcookie2809: who complains all the time?

[2017-01-16 21:50:42 UTC] pr34ch: Royal_Phalanx91 how could call it lucky since he has got two of the damn things
[2017-01-16 21:50:48 UTC] winderfiend764: Yep his very own Sun. I usually save him so he can Burn himself in his own ending lighting the Fire assuming he gets the same choices we get in his world

[2017-01-16 21:51:47 UTC] bbt_2016: yes shot cuz hes good at DS
[2017-01-16 21:51:48 UTC] trigunrk: nope he didn't play sotfs

[2017-01-16 21:53:16 UTC] winderfiend764: Did he get the DLC ending?

[2017-01-16 21:53:47 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well let's be honest, Phil was one of the first to jump on the 'fake news' bandwagon. Anything presented, even with proof, he shoots down as fake. Credit to Phil fro being ahead of the curve there
[2017-01-16 21:53:48 UTC] winderfiend764: If he still has his DS2 data all he'd have to do would download then Backtrack

[2017-01-16 21:56:02 UTC] trigunrk: @DarksydePhil havel's ring boosts equip load by 50%
[2017-01-16 21:56:03 UTC] mobiuslaw: phil 1v1 me
[2017-01-16 21:56:05 UTC] royal_phalanx91: he said hes doing it

[2017-01-16 22:23:18 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, i noticed that retention in viewership has been better for you when you play one game to beat it and move on.. (this game is an example right now) any chance you may adopt this method ? i think it will be a success
[2017-01-16 22:23:19 UTC] naddodr: these morons will now return to their caves, complain to their friends and then those friends will come here, like "why are people banned for criticism"

[2017-01-16 22:25:54 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well I'm trying to establish what else could be deemed 'fake' or 'not legit', since Phil considered this playthrough not legit before returning to it. What other games has Phil not 'legit' beat, in his own opinion anyway? There's been games he's used some cheats to finish with (GTA 3, San Andreas?) for a start, but who knows if there'd be high demand for that. There's also the S-word game which had a huge amount of cheating lol but Phil's kinda sworn off that
[2017-01-16 22:25:55 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Phil was good at Titanfall
[2017-01-16 22:25:59 UTC] lightweightbro: Phils not bad at games, the games just don't do well when he plays Kappa

[2017-01-16 22:26:18 UTC] encelor: is it true that phil is pupulair at 4chan?

[2017-01-16 22:26:18 UTC] bethe2670: WALL OF TEXT WutFace
[2017-01-16 22:26:20 UTC] bammbino: @Ado17x, i respected his choice to have his own chat and what not.. but ive been part of twitch since early JTV days so i and many fans wont give up on this site
[2017-01-16 22:26:20 UTC] retrocerberus: I thought RE4 was all right
[2017-01-16 22:26:21 UTC] ado17x: For income purposes twitch is where it's at imo

[2017-01-16 22:26:44 UTC] snipertheladiesman: in the game*
[2017-01-16 22:26:44 UTC] beanie5181: @mr_vidar_viking wheres your twitch turbo badge youre slacking :/
[2017-01-16 22:26:44 UTC] winderfiend764: Break
[2017-01-16 22:26:44 UTC] bethe2670: phil pre ordered the switch already
[2017-01-16 22:26:45 UTC] the_mother: So where is he up to?
[2017-01-16 22:26:48 UTC] retrocerberus: out of all the playthroughs New vegas is Phil's best original pt
[2017-01-16 22:26:52 UTC] indicansent: wall of text isn't popular on stream chats
[2017-01-16 22:26:54 UTC] bethe2670: so he is getting it
[2017-01-16 22:26:55 UTC] bbt_2016: phil is good at games tbh youtubers like game grumps/ radbrad are bad
[2017-01-16 22:26:55 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @RetroCerberus he was shit at most of it and got the chat to tell him secret locations
[2017-01-16 22:26:58 UTC] kinggoken: did he say what games he was getting for switch?
[2017-01-16 22:27:00 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I honestly don't know what a turbobadge is and means
[2017-01-16 22:27:01 UTC] encelor: @bethe2670 switch is 300 $ right?
[2017-01-16 22:27:02 UTC] winderfiend764: But he killed Cass
[2017-01-16 22:27:02 UTC] indicansent: i did read it all tho
[2017-01-16 22:27:05 UTC] ziibrah: RetroCerberus, heavy rain would like to have a talk with you
[2017-01-16 22:27:07 UTC] weirdbutt: 4chan could care less about phil
[2017-01-16 22:27:11 UTC] bammbino: @Ado17x, i agree, i know tons of YTubers that flat out make more money on twitch cause of YT fucking with CPM and ad revenue for their gains
[2017-01-16 22:27:13 UTC] kinggoken: switch is 300
[2017-01-16 22:27:15 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well the short version is, what other games has Phil not legit beat? Aside from GTA3, San Andreas and the S-word game?
[2017-01-16 22:27:16 UTC] bethe2670: zelda and mario late rin the year
[2017-01-16 22:27:21 UTC] bethe2670: encelor yes
[2017-01-16 22:27:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Zelda is the only one I seen him mention Kinggoken
[2017-01-16 22:27:24 UTC] lightweightbro: the best playthrough phil ever did is the first silent hill :)
[2017-01-16 22:27:24 UTC] encelor: nice i might get one for zelda then
[2017-01-16 22:27:25 UTC] retrocerberus: Ok, i don't remember RE4 that good, Heavy Rain is all right
[2017-01-16 22:27:31 UTC] beanie5181: @mr_vidar_viking its another badge you get for being turboed on twitch :P
[2017-01-16 22:27:33 UTC] lightweightbro: go back and watch it if you havent
[2017-01-16 22:27:37 UTC] lergen1: @KingjadVCMP whats the s-word game
[2017-01-16 22:27:41 UTC] snipertheladiesman: WHERE IS phil in DARK SOULS?
[2017-01-16 22:27:43 UTC] kinggoken: hmm Zelda. That should be fun.
[2017-01-16 22:27:51 UTC] royal_phalanx91: During his last playthrough of Dark souls he was pretty bad, got fans to do all the fighting for him using summons
[2017-01-16 22:27:51 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Not sure if the S-word game is a banned word or not in chat....
[2017-01-16 22:27:54 UTC] ziibrah: lost izalith or whatever
[2017-01-16 22:27:54 UTC] encelor: @Snipertheladiesman lava area

[2017-01-16 22:27:57 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I don't honestly know what being turboed on twitch does
[2017-01-16 22:28:04 UTC] lightweightbro: bed of chaos @Snipertheladiesman
[2017-01-16 22:28:04 UTC] indicansent: nah best playthrogh of DSP was either MGS, Jak 1 or Crash 2
[2017-01-16 22:28:08 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I mean I have seen the badge, but never question what it stands for
[2017-01-16 22:28:11 UTC] bpcbrrnfacrw: some fresh grill t.co/jnHkmFRMnF
[2017-01-16 22:28:11 UTC] nightbot: bpcbrrnfacrw -> I'm going to kill you old style. [stop posting links] [warning]
[2017-01-16 22:28:11 UTC] winderfiend764: Oh I know what the s word is now
[2017-01-16 22:28:14 UTC] lergen1: @mr_vidar_viking removes ads
[2017-01-16 22:28:15 UTC] beanie5181: @Snipertheladiesman idk he beat a lava scoprion like a hour ago if that helps im kinda tired
[2017-01-16 22:28:20 UTC] somefatguysarm: its like YT red
[2017-01-16 22:28:26 UTC] redrizla: I think it no ads or something
[2017-01-16 22:28:26 UTC] coldkiller86: Phil Should do a redemption run of Hitman cuz i have seen his vids and wow he didnt do great
[2017-01-16 22:28:27 UTC] lightweightbro: kill you old style? what does that mean
[2017-01-16 22:28:28 UTC] kinggoken: exactly. Just like yt red.
[2017-01-16 22:28:29 UTC] bethe2670: i dont want full price nintendo switch
[2017-01-16 22:28:33 UTC] xxalex2394: phil please dont use vr for resident evil 7
[2017-01-16 22:28:35 UTC] gamerzim: @mr_vidar_viking, Paying for turbo gives you the badge, some emotes, and no ads basically.
[2017-01-16 22:28:38 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @mr_vidar_viking if you click on it it tells you. Its the same as subbing you just pay more
[2017-01-16 22:28:41 UTC] lergen1: @winderfiend764 what is it
[2017-01-16 22:28:45 UTC] retrocerberus: I think alan wake had potentional to be great but the story gets boring halfway for Phil's playthrough, I could never finish it all
[2017-01-16 22:28:47 UTC] indicansent: DSP is at his best when he plays old-school retro grames
[2017-01-16 22:29:01 UTC] bethe2670: subbing gives you a badge, no ads and emotes
[2017-01-16 22:29:03 UTC] kinggoken: I would like to see dsp return to street fighter
[2017-01-16 22:29:08 UTC] lightweightbro: except nobody watches them @indicansent
[2017-01-16 22:29:11 UTC] lightweightbro: so screw that
[2017-01-16 22:29:15 UTC] indicansent: @Kinggoken Same here
[2017-01-16 22:29:17 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: it's like a twitch subsription for all channels or something ??
[2017-01-16 22:29:21 UTC] snipertheladiesman: @encelor @LightWeightBro @Beanie5181 ok thanks
[2017-01-16 22:29:21 UTC] bammbino: @Royal_Phalanx91, i dont blame him ONE BIT!! ds1 had me and a friend in tears of laughter and frustration in less than 45min of playing the game! my friend traded it in less the 1 hour of playing and i went to buy a guide
[2017-01-16 22:29:29 UTC] hodge__podge: is this pc or console? and if its pc is he using DSfix?
[2017-01-16 22:29:31 UTC] xrydisx: ban me please
[2017-01-16 22:29:34 UTC] bethe2670: vidar lol no
[2017-01-16 22:29:36 UTC] theycallmejimbob: 360 Hodge__Podge
[2017-01-16 22:29:40 UTC] indicansent: @LightWeightBro Plenty people watch them. Crash 2 got lots of stream viewers.
[2017-01-16 22:29:40 UTC] encelor: @Hodge__Podge its on console
[2017-01-16 22:29:42 UTC] hodge__podge: ok thanks
[2017-01-16 22:29:47 UTC] redrizla: @Hodge__Podge, 360 version so fps is what you would expect
[2017-01-16 22:29:53 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Phil should play XCOM 2
[2017-01-16 22:29:53 UTC] lightweightbro: only because of the rage @indicansent
[2017-01-16 22:29:54 UTC] gamerzim: @mr_vidar_viking, It's a Twitch benefits you could say.
[2017-01-16 22:29:57 UTC] yacherdy: They tweaked Turkish Royals
[2017-01-16 22:29:59 UTC] yacherdy: guys
[2017-01-16 22:30:08 UTC] winderfiend764: Xcom yes please
[2017-01-16 22:30:09 UTC] indicansent: @LightWeightBro Yeah but that's part of the fun.
[2017-01-16 22:30:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: okey
[2017-01-16 22:30:10 UTC] encelor: turkish royals?
[2017-01-16 22:30:13 UTC] bbt_2016: i cant wait til phil plays SF2 on the switch a game hes badass at haters gonna be salty lol
[2017-01-16 22:30:14 UTC] lightweightbro: if he plays a normal easy old school game he doesnt get many viewers
[2017-01-16 22:30:15 UTC] encelor: airplain?
[2017-01-16 22:30:19 UTC] lightweightbro: its only the rage type games
[2017-01-16 22:30:21 UTC] rbreezay: What happened?
[2017-01-16 22:30:22 UTC] bethe2670: you get more emotes and another badge lol
[2017-01-16 22:30:23 UTC] yacherdy: Ciggy
[2017-01-16 22:30:24 UTC] rbreezay: Break?
[2017-01-16 22:30:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: is there a release date for that bbt_2016?
[2017-01-16 22:30:31 UTC] kinggoken: he is on break
[2017-01-16 22:30:37 UTC] kingjadvcmp: isn't the switch in excess of $600 or something if you buy everything for it?
[2017-01-16 22:30:39 UTC] indicansent: @LightWeightBro Exactly. Look at Dead Rising 4
[2017-01-16 22:30:41 UTC] kinggoken: he was actually chatting in the chat for a bit then vanished lol
[2017-01-16 22:30:43 UTC] bbt_2016: no jimbob
[2017-01-16 22:30:43 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I thought it was superfast people or something.
[2017-01-16 22:30:44 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob later this year lol
[2017-01-16 22:30:52 UTC] shotinthedeep: You can also choose the color of your name if you have turbo twitch
[2017-01-16 22:30:57 UTC] encelor: @KingjadVCMP switch cost 300 $
[2017-01-16 22:31:04 UTC] kingjadvcmp: but there's peripherals and shit
[2017-01-16 22:31:07 UTC] kingjadvcmp: which are pricey
[2017-01-16 22:31:08 UTC] bethe2670: yeah you can get more colours
[2017-01-16 22:31:11 UTC] bammbino: @encelor, he means with parts and accessories
[2017-01-16 22:31:15 UTC] encelor: ooh
[2017-01-16 22:31:19 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @kingjadvcmp Just buying the Switch, a normal controller and a video game to use the switch is well over 400...
[2017-01-16 22:31:19 UTC] indicansent: I hope DSP knows he has to pay for online on Switch too
[2017-01-16 22:31:23 UTC] encelor: don't know about the parts sorry
[2017-01-16 22:31:41 UTC] yacherdy: I haven't been sold on a Nintendo console since N64
[2017-01-16 22:31:43 UTC] bethe2670: you might get some bits for going turbo for free i dont know lol
[2017-01-16 22:31:49 UTC] kinggoken: online on switch will be free for a few months
[2017-01-16 22:31:54 UTC] snipertheladiesman: anyone know how many deaths he's at?
[2017-01-16 22:31:56 UTC] bammbino: i will ONLY buy a switch for pokemon and thats it! im 28 y/o and still wish for a full RPG experience in pokemon
[2017-01-16 22:32:01 UTC] redrizla: 146 I think?
[2017-01-16 22:32:02 UTC] kingjadvcmp: yeah I read that somewhere, it'll be free at first online
[2017-01-16 22:32:21 UTC] lemonplaysgames: lol, oh yeah, and pay to play online. Free for a few months...what a joke.
[2017-01-16 22:32:21 UTC] winderfiend764: 100+ maybe around 140s
[2017-01-16 22:32:23 UTC] wan_ki_moon: the way his channel has gone people now prefer to watch him rage then watch the gameplay thats why the *** videos get more views than his playthroughs that he uploas
[2017-01-16 22:32:24 UTC] encelor: @Bammbino pokemon series is going on to switch?
[2017-01-16 22:32:24 UTC] indicansent: @Kinggoken I heard it's just for the first month, the release month. Then you pay for it afterwards
[2017-01-16 22:32:26 UTC] lergen1: @bethe2670 "FREE"
[2017-01-16 22:32:30 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i just want mario, smt and metroid pretty much. maybe if there's some good exclusives from third party devs i'll want more
[2017-01-16 22:32:42 UTC] macmargera12: where is he
[2017-01-16 22:32:43 UTC] lemonplaysgames: They have noting to offer for an online experience that compares to other platforms.
[2017-01-16 22:32:43 UTC] gaylordbutthump: never paying for online though, fuck that
[2017-01-16 22:32:45 UTC] iconicmaster1: Smash 52
[2017-01-16 22:32:47 UTC] indicansent: Plus for SF2 he has to get the Pro Controller at least so that's $70
[2017-01-16 22:32:48 UTC] bbt_2016: bammbino switch is a 3ds replacement too so Pokémon has to be on it
[2017-01-16 22:32:52 UTC] iconicmaster1: 5
[2017-01-16 22:32:57 UTC] shotinthedeep: It's ad free, custom emotes, more colors, increased video storage, and turbo badge
[2017-01-16 22:33:03 UTC] lukeyrocks221: is this the guy that gets rekt in mortal kombat?
[2017-01-16 22:33:09 UTC] kinggoken: do you guys consider the Nintendo Switch to be a console or a portable?
[2017-01-16 22:33:10 UTC] bammbino: @encelor, i dont follow alot of pokemon news nor nintendo news.. but there is a rumor that pokemon sun / moon have been in developement for the switch
[2017-01-16 22:33:13 UTC] iconicmaster1: EleGiggle
[2017-01-16 22:33:24 UTC] iconicmaster1: Both
[2017-01-16 22:33:33 UTC] indicansent: $480 for it all if he gets Zelda on top of that
[2017-01-16 22:33:44 UTC] encelor: @Bammbino if its true that would be awesome i was tired of buying new handhelds all the time
[2017-01-16 22:33:46 UTC] indicansent: Assuming the games are $50
[2017-01-16 22:33:47 UTC] punishedmac: Beat Poniff Sulyvahn on third attempt on my SL1 character lets go boys PogChamp
[2017-01-16 22:33:49 UTC] bammbino: @encelor, if you look at the early videos pokemon released on their YT channel, you can see models in wireframes that dont look like 3ds quality
[2017-01-16 22:33:51 UTC] snipertheladiesman: @lukeyrocks221 yes lol
[2017-01-16 22:33:54 UTC] bbt_2016: switch is a portable
[2017-01-16 22:34:04 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @indicansent I love how they're calling it a "Pro controller" There's nothing Pro about it, it's a normal controller that gets included in every other system.
[2017-01-16 22:34:20 UTC] bammbino: can be portable, its still a weak home system which is still better than 3ds
[2017-01-16 22:34:38 UTC] indicansent: @LemonPlaysGames Lol yep; for me no Nintendo controller beats the wireless Wavebird anyway
[2017-01-16 22:34:46 UTC] encelor: i see switch as a gamecube dunno why
[2017-01-16 22:34:53 UTC] bammbino: my only concern for the switch is that they will be dickheads and make a XL, lite and all kinds of versions to milk their fans
[2017-01-16 22:34:54 UTC] cte900: i always buy consoles right when they come out and then wait for games. i think i'll buy it a year late this time so i don't have to wait for a library i want to play
[2017-01-16 22:34:57 UTC] yacherdy: I'll just stick to my PC
[2017-01-16 22:35:09 UTC] iconicmaster1: Joy stick looks like a cellphone with button and analog stick
[2017-01-16 22:35:15 UTC] lightweightbro: Poniff Sulyvahn is easy @punishedmac
[2017-01-16 22:35:31 UTC] indicansent: Pro Controller is overpriced; PS4 and XBO controllers are $60; Smash controller was $30 and has most of the same functionality as Pro Controller
[2017-01-16 22:35:40 UTC] bbt_2016: pontiff destroyed phil
[2017-01-16 22:35:50 UTC] lightweightbro: how many people are on stream right now?
[2017-01-16 22:35:52 UTC] gaylordbutthump: gundyr really destroyed phil
[2017-01-16 22:35:57 UTC] gaylordbutthump: 575
[2017-01-16 22:36:00 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I do feel this is Nintendo's swan song for a hardware company. My prediction, they're going full software after this.
[2017-01-16 22:36:05 UTC] encelor: pontiff ?
[2017-01-16 22:36:08 UTC] encelor: the pope?
[2017-01-16 22:36:08 UTC] bammbino: @indicansent, ps4 controllers are usually $45 or less on amazon! sometimes 50
[2017-01-16 22:36:09 UTC] sonicsanchez: 69
[2017-01-16 22:36:09 UTC] encelor: wut
[2017-01-16 22:36:10 UTC] iconicmaster1: Is Phil about to fight the boss

[2017-01-16 22:36:24 UTC] bbt_2016: pro controller is only $10 more than a ps4 1
[2017-01-16 22:36:29 UTC] punishedmac: @LightWeightBro, Level 1, bro.
[2017-01-16 22:36:30 UTC] indicansent: I hope Switch does okay but it might do only about 45-55 million in sales, if they do everything right
[2017-01-16 22:36:33 UTC] bammbino: @LemonPlaysGames, i wished for that since ps2 days
[2017-01-16 22:36:35 UTC] kinggoken: Kurt Angle in wwe hall of fame?
[2017-01-16 22:36:38 UTC] indicansent: Which they won't
[2017-01-16 22:36:40 UTC] yacherdy: @Kinggoken Yah
[2017-01-16 22:36:41 UTC] kingjadvcmp: the breaks hurt Phil's numbers quite a bit I feel. I noticed it steadily climb more and more, but there's a huge drop-off for breaks. Shame Phil can't do much shorter breaks or something.
[2017-01-16 22:36:42 UTC] snipertheladiesman: @bbt_2016 that it did, i just beat lord wolner in DS3, really cool fun boss, phil calls him cheap and the worst boss in any souls game lol
[2017-01-16 22:36:51 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @bbt_2016 And yet, it's not included with the system -_-
[2017-01-16 22:37:00 UTC] gaylordbutthump: wolnir is easy as hell

[2017-01-16 22:37:06 UTC] coldkiller86: @posicolo what is he throwing in the trash is it a wii?
[2017-01-16 22:37:10 UTC] popsicolo: Phil should do stuff with the greenscreen again now that he can.
[2017-01-16 22:37:12 UTC] kinggoken: I think the switch needs a better launch lineup
[2017-01-16 22:37:18 UTC] indicansent: @LemonPlaysGames It could be, but I hope not. I still want Nintendo to stick around. Already sucked when Sega got out of hardware, can't have Nintendo leave too.
[2017-01-16 22:37:25 UTC] bammbino: @LemonPlaysGames, it boggles my mind how nintendo thinks pokemon selling a bit under 10% of the 3ds userbase is a success
[2017-01-16 22:37:30 UTC] redrizla: @KingjadVCMP, I think Phil is the only streamer I've seen who does breaks like this. Others will just say "be right back guys" if they need to go the bathroom or something

[2017-01-16 22:38:19 UTC] encelor: @Kinggoken pretty sure nintendo is gonna pull off a low quantity launch for switch so people will feel the exclusivity of it and buy it for 400-500$

[2017-01-16 22:38:58 UTC] akioartorius: Phil did do some of the hitman elusive target i think

[2017-01-16 22:39:15 UTC] clesstheangel: I just said that he was treating his fans like shit

[2017-01-16 22:39:33 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @ClessTheAngel he does though
[2017-01-16 22:39:37 UTC] 0megaj0ker: Cless is not going to be in the corner
[2017-01-16 22:39:40 UTC] matt_radartechnician: if my boobs were DD i would be happy, but no, I have G-cups and my back is always in pain

[2017-01-16 22:39:51 UTC] humpiershaggy: Flush the miserable douche
[2017-01-16 22:39:52 UTC] indicansent: @encelor True, but their entire business wasn't dependent on NES Classic. Their future depends on how well Switch does
[2017-01-16 22:39:55 UTC] bammbino: @ClessTheAngel, no need to try and white knight any of us fans.. we know when he his talking about us and when hes not

[2017-01-16 22:41:22 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I'm in both chats too. Big deal. Not breaking any rules, actively engaging in chat and not trying to disturb shit. Talking to some of you guys is fun
[2017-01-16 22:41:25 UTC] weirdbutt: no, no DLC
[2017-01-16 22:41:25 UTC] clesstheangel: So you're telling me him saying: "you're all whiny children" isn't treating his fans like shit? Come now, don't be stupid
[2017-01-16 22:41:26 UTC] akioartorius: why deacons?

[2017-01-16 22:41:33 UTC] skulljack17: But sometimes to be a fan you need to call out things that are wrong.
[2017-01-16 22:41:35 UTC] bethe2670: i assumed phil meant the trolls
[2017-01-16 22:41:41 UTC] bethe2670: but i dont know
[2017-01-16 22:41:46 UTC] trigunrk: i guess phil's not doing the 4 kings?
[2017-01-16 22:41:49 UTC] kinggoken: he probably meant the trolls/haters/detractors lol
[2017-01-16 22:41:50 UTC] shotinthedeep: He was referencing the trolls
[2017-01-16 22:41:52 UTC] skulljack17: I mean, what's the point of trying to support someone otherwise?

[2017-01-16 22:42:12 UTC] fattyboy067: but then you're not really fanatical about the series, you're just fanatical about one or two games of the series
[2017-01-16 22:42:14 UTC] humpiershaggy: He was talking to the spamming morons.

[2017-01-16 22:42:37 UTC] snipertheladiesman: @akioartorius although they were easy it was really cool to jump in the middle of them and cut through to get to the main guy to damage
[2017-01-16 22:42:47 UTC] encelor: @HumpierShaggy they say this to trigger phil fanbase to get reactions

[2017-01-16 22:46:04 UTC] kingjadvcmp: well viking is the sort of person Phil does not like - he associates on twitter a lot with detractors. Which is ironic, because viking does not seem to mind Phil hating him for this

[2017-01-16 23:13:02 UTC] raptorbread: Bloodborne was a great game because it's combat style was different from dark souls. I had to actively get used to it and felt the same rewarding feeling that I got when I first killed bosses in DS1. DS3 was way too easy for me.

I played it my first time without DSfix though and was okay, but the 60fps fix with my 1080 was nice. How bad are the drops on your hardware?
[2017-01-16 23:34:04 UTC] popsicolo: What would that look like?

[2017-01-16 23:34:34 UTC] lemonplaysgames: All I've seen as far as facts go is this boss was originally supposed to be a full on boss, but due to issues/time constraints, they just wipped it up like this just to get it working. In short, it wasn't a finished boss.

[2017-01-16 23:41:35 UTC] raptorbread: "Since I had the opportunity, I had to ask what Miyazaki’s least favorite zone from the franchise is as well. The answer should come as no surprise to fans of the series – it’s the lava/dinosaur nightmare known as Lost Izalith in Dark Souls. Miyazaki comments “Don’t want to elaborate on this very much. There was a different person assigned to this area, and although I was involved, I don’t want to pose very many negative comments for his sake. It can be a learning experience for all of us.”
