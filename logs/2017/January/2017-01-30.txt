[2017-01-30 20:28:46 UTC] shotinthedeep: If they don't want to see it they don't have to watch the videos

[2017-01-30 20:29:12 UTC] bethe2670: DUUUUH
[2017-01-30 20:29:14 UTC] alex_dragonul: Yea if Phil will go with that political vlog thing , i think it is for the better to be a separate channel , but on the poll a lot of votes were to remain on his vlog channel
[2017-01-30 20:29:19 UTC] derichloveslemur: how is everyone doing today?
[2017-01-30 20:29:21 UTC] theycallmejimbob: doctor walterrolh health is wealth and all that
[2017-01-30 20:29:22 UTC] fensthespook: Do twitch subs get to do Ask the King? or just Patreon?

[2017-01-30 20:29:56 UTC] tedicotuckz: Eh
[2017-01-30 20:30:00 UTC] blue_blur64: HeyGuys
[2017-01-30 20:30:05 UTC] oddy555: Doing a playthrough with vr would be amazing because of the fact that we will se actual reactions from the game and not someone being distracted by streamchat
[2017-01-30 20:30:05 UTC] shotinthedeep: Hi silent!
[2017-01-30 20:30:08 UTC] tedicotuckz: Nah Phil I'm not gonna watch it
[2017-01-30 20:30:10 UTC] retrocerberus: phil u have a lot of content already with your playthroughs you can repackage them as 25 min montage of all the best parts and put them on KOgaming
[2017-01-30 20:30:19 UTC] ginosaji48: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuyvBmlUpug
[2017-01-30 20:30:19 UTC] tedicotuckz: Lmao people
[2017-01-30 20:30:32 UTC] xgameofpwns: Phil you might want to consider doing some games off stream as well as on stream and post both to YT. If we watch a stream, we're less likely to watch on YT so having an offstream game will supplement thatless likely
[2017-01-30 20:30:34 UTC] tedicotuckz: Just watch his damn vr playthrough when he does it
[2017-01-30 20:30:37 UTC] alex_dragonul: Phil imo , i think you should just put it on Ko Gaming as the montage but yet again i would still watch it on DSPG
[2017-01-30 20:30:42 UTC] istherefity: is it true you're keeping patreon but wont make any ore youtube videos?
[2017-01-30 20:30:47 UTC] shotinthedeep: Yeah at least make a montage of the VR vids if you don't upload them
[2017-01-30 20:30:49 UTC] fensthespook: Subbed to help support you man, hope things get better.
