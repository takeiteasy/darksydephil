[2017-01-03 20:04:04 UTC] yacherdy: McCree is not a character I ever worry about unless I'm Tracer or a healer.
[2017-01-03 20:04:10 UTC] yacherdy: Sometimes Pharah.
[2017-01-03 20:04:37 UTC] yacherdy: It's Symmetra who is currently overpowered.
[2017-01-03 20:04:38 UTC] marleve_lynen: update's done for me!

[2017-01-03 20:06:27 UTC] clesstheangel: of course, it was the initial hype that made those first dudes sub right away
[2017-01-03 20:06:53 UTC] marleve_lynen: it's automatic unless you don't renew
[2017-01-03 20:07:08 UTC] gergc5: :D
[2017-01-03 20:07:22 UTC] retrocerberus: dat sucks
[2017-01-03 20:07:23 UTC] bethe2670: that makes no sense to me marle cause if you gotta renew how is that automatic

[2017-01-03 20:07:35 UTC] bobbi_ling: is he playing overwatch 1st?
[2017-01-03 20:07:38 UTC] bethe2670: yes
[2017-01-03 20:07:40 UTC] clesstheangel: it gives you like 3 days or so to renew if you pass the month without renewing
[2017-01-03 20:07:45 UTC] marleve_lynen: it renews a month after you subbed
[2017-01-03 20:07:55 UTC] marleve_lynen: so like if you subbed on jan 1st, it would renew on feb 1st
[2017-01-03 20:08:06 UTC] gergc5: :D lol
[2017-01-03 20:08:09 UTC] bethe2670: an you dont have to do anything

[2017-01-03 20:09:48 UTC] yacherdy: @jackwhite2000 I'd say Zenyatta and maybe Winston.
[2017-01-03 20:09:53 UTC] deltaforce355: he didnt played it, right?
[2017-01-03 20:09:54 UTC] bethe2670: bobbi it does i think
