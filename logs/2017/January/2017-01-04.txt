[2017-01-04 19:27:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: well the first red flag was marle was a "grill" second red flag was marle was a weeb and third red flag "she" didn't reject Bethe's advances
[2017-01-04 19:27:39 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I just find it really ironic that the Eddy guy who kept spamming his stream link tot hat freedom chat crap was actually a thing that Marle was apart of.
[2017-01-04 19:27:39 UTC] deltaforce355: how weeb jimbob?
[2017-01-04 19:27:54 UTC] bethe2670: i knew gino before marle jimbob and gino was the one who modded him in the first place
[2017-01-04 19:27:58 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @theycallmejimbob, That last one LUL
[2017-01-04 19:28:02 UTC] bethe2670: not my fault
[2017-01-04 19:28:13 UTC] n0_h3r0: @LemonPlaysGames, Dood that's how I found it lmao. Eddy was the traitor all along tbh.
[2017-01-04 19:28:17 UTC] deltaforce355: and its not gino's fault too
[2017-01-04 19:28:17 UTC] theycallmejimbob: maybe if eddy didn't spam his links their dastardly plan might of came off LemonPlaysGames
[2017-01-04 19:28:19 UTC] bethe2670: and he even played overwatch with phil
[2017-01-04 19:28:21 UTC] bethe2670: woooow
[2017-01-04 19:28:36 UTC] deltaforce355: troll of the year i guess
[2017-01-04 19:28:54 UTC] n0_h3r0: Tfw when your mod is a troll and a trap dspGlitch
[2017-01-04 19:28:54 UTC] bethe2670: i didnt even know wtf happened until i woke up this morning
[2017-01-04 19:28:57 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn don't think there will be as big of a heel turn in 2017
[2017-01-04 19:29:15 UTC] bethe2670: and my jaw dropped
[2017-01-04 19:29:23 UTC] deltaforce355: 2017 is getting interesting
[2017-01-04 19:29:26 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @theycallmejimbob, But now Phil has to be overly cautious now before he even thinks about modding anyone or giving anyone special privileges.
[2017-01-04 19:29:32 UTC] bethe2670: i thought if anybody would betray phil it would be dragin or bobbi
[2017-01-04 19:29:40 UTC] bethe2670: no marle but ah well
[2017-01-04 19:30:09 UTC] deltaforce355: phil is gonna rant about it in the prestream
[2017-01-04 19:30:13 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I thought I seen in the bigger channels you can have global moderators and "normal" moderators,couldn't he make mods that can't change Nightbots commands LemonPlaysGames ?
[2017-01-04 19:30:23 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Bobbi was right bethe2670 we all owe her an apology
[2017-01-04 19:30:28 UTC] n0_h3r0: @bethe2670, Dragin and Bobbi are secretly working together to bring about an insurrection. %1000 Cannon
[2017-01-04 19:30:29 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @theycallmejimbob, Yeah, I think so.
[2017-01-04 19:30:31 UTC] bethe2670: i'm 100% trustworthy and loyal to phil jimbob, bobbi and dragin would say otherwise but oh well
[2017-01-04 19:30:59 UTC] bethe2670: hey i will say sorry to bobbi
[2017-01-04 19:31:02 UTC] n0_h3r0: I'm not trustworthy. I'm a dirty rotten scoundrel tbh
[2017-01-04 19:31:06 UTC] bethe2670: im not afraid of that
[2017-01-04 19:31:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bethe please there's enough going on without the you vs the world tirade

[2017-01-04 19:32:29 UTC] aglet57: hope DSP just puts it behind him. Got it out last night, but then there's games to be played.
[2017-01-04 19:32:31 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Mods can't ban other mods LUL
[2017-01-04 19:32:40 UTC] n0_h3r0: It's the only to insure a trol free environment
[2017-01-04 19:32:41 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob stop that
[2017-01-04 19:32:42 UTC] aglet57: drama sucks. period.
[2017-01-04 19:32:52 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @AGLET57, Agreed.
[2017-01-04 19:33:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: they were gonna pin it on Gino too :(
[2017-01-04 19:33:20 UTC] deltaforce355: wasnt there a chat called freedom chat?
[2017-01-04 19:33:28 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob really?
[2017-01-04 19:33:31 UTC] deltaforce355: they are shitting on phil on that one
[2017-01-04 19:33:34 UTC] bethe2670: what the fuck

[2017-01-04 19:34:21 UTC] bethe2670: i knew gino well before marle
[2017-01-04 19:34:38 UTC] deltaforce355: why dont you be a mod Bethe in replace of "marle"
[2017-01-04 19:34:40 UTC] bethe2670: or carl or asshole
[2017-01-04 19:34:58 UTC] thecowboyboyfromhell213: hello Kappa

[2017-01-04 19:35:01 UTC] bethe2670: tbh
[2017-01-04 19:35:02 UTC] bethe2670: lol
[2017-01-04 19:35:15 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I love how they call us blind fanboys, yet they're doing mental gymnastics themselves thinking a 28 year old weeb pretending to be a chick for 6 months is normal and planning on releasing personal info about phil. All because Phil said some mean things about games they like....
[2017-01-04 19:35:16 UTC] bethe2670: except i could try to get trolls quick
[2017-01-04 19:35:18 UTC] bethe2670: hmmm
[2017-01-04 19:35:29 UTC] aglet57: no offense, but why do we need mods? Nightbot (when not fucked up) can handle kicks and bans, right?
[2017-01-04 19:35:39 UTC] aglet57: it's not like IRC, which was like the wild west
[2017-01-04 19:35:42 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @AGLET57, Not when it's personal attacks, no.
[2017-01-04 19:35:46 UTC] lemonplaysgames: They don't have a mind of their own.
[2017-01-04 19:35:47 UTC] bethe2670: mods control nightbot
[2017-01-04 19:35:53 UTC] lemonplaysgames: They can only time out specific key words and such.
[2017-01-04 19:36:01 UTC] aglet57: oh. nm then
[2017-01-04 19:36:13 UTC] n0_h3r0: Bro the only reason I even went out of my way is because I got permed by marle lmao. If that didn't happen I woulda just went on with my day and nightbot woulda been in Terminator mode lmao.
[2017-01-04 19:36:13 UTC] bethe2670: true jimbob
[2017-01-04 19:36:25 UTC] bethe2670: i think these assholes should be locked up
[2017-01-04 19:36:36 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @theycallmejimbob, Yeah, that's pretty petty and sad. I wonder what his social life looks like LUL
[2017-01-04 19:36:40 UTC] n0_h3r0: Everyone woulda been getting T-100's lol
[2017-01-04 19:36:44 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Probably doesn't socialize well other than the keyboard.
[2017-01-04 19:37:07 UTC] bethe2670: what social life lemon
[2017-01-04 19:37:12 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Exactly.
[2017-01-04 19:37:43 UTC] aglet57: So...finally finishing Pokemon then. That's been going on for awhile
[2017-01-04 19:37:47 UTC] deltaforce355: maybe they are checking out chat right now...
[2017-01-04 19:37:54 UTC] thecowboyboyfromhell213: yep
[2017-01-04 19:37:57 UTC] n0_h3r0: Pokemon high LETS GOOOOOO

[2017-01-04 19:38:28 UTC] parkfiction: Review when?
[2017-01-04 19:38:37 UTC] n0_h3r0: HAS THE CAPS BAN HAS BEEN LIFTED?
[2017-01-04 19:38:37 UTC] nightbot: N0_H3R0 -> Please do not abuse capital letters, thank you. [warning]
[2017-01-04 19:38:38 UTC] thecowboyboyfromhell213: sub only mode hype? Kappa
[2017-01-04 19:38:40 UTC] aglet57: I'm not a big Pokemon fan, so I'm glad it's over. Can't wait for RE7 though. Should be fun.
[2017-01-04 19:38:45 UTC] n0_h3r0: nope rekt lol
[2017-01-04 19:39:17 UTC] n0_h3r0: @thecowboyboyfromhell213, That'd be like 10 people lmao
[2017-01-04 19:39:18 UTC] deltaforce355: maybe they are checking this chat now and laughing at us...
[2017-01-04 19:39:22 UTC] deltaforce355: just saying
[2017-01-04 19:39:27 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @AGLET57, How high are your expectations for RE7?
[2017-01-04 19:39:31 UTC] deltaforce355: im not sure though
[2017-01-04 19:39:31 UTC] kingjadvcmp: lol
[2017-01-04 19:40:00 UTC] aglet57: @LemonPlaysGames I think it will make for a good playthrough here. Not sure about how it will play in the comfort of my own living room
[2017-01-04 19:40:05 UTC] n0_h3r0: @KingjadVCMP, Same
[2017-01-04 19:40:15 UTC] bethe2670: now nightbot has cracked down on repeats and caps
[2017-01-04 19:40:17 UTC] bethe2670: :(
[2017-01-04 19:40:21 UTC] bethe2670: oh well
[2017-01-04 19:40:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yeah delta, they truly are masterminds divulging their plan on an open chat room. Phil really has some tough opposition on his hands :D.
[2017-01-04 19:40:36 UTC] mylthazz: what if nightbot became self aware and Merle didn't do it
[2017-01-04 19:40:42 UTC] bethe2670: gotta get used to it again
[2017-01-04 19:40:42 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I can't believe people are losing their minds over...nightbot.
[2017-01-04 19:40:44 UTC] n0_h3r0: I miss the old nightbot :( That's the worst thing to come out of this. No more all caps :(
[2017-01-04 19:40:59 UTC] bethe2670: yeah no hero
[2017-01-04 19:41:14 UTC] bethe2670: it wasnt nightbot
[2017-01-04 19:41:16 UTC] n0_h3r0: @KingjadVCMP, First world problems at its finest tbh dspGlitch
[2017-01-04 19:41:25 UTC] bethe2670: is was the motherfucker behind that bot
[2017-01-04 19:41:40 UTC] mylthazz: right now i'm not trusting anyone, especially nightbot
[2017-01-04 19:41:43 UTC] aglet57: Marle was the Higher Power. It was me, Austin!
[2017-01-04 19:41:53 UTC] theycallmejimbob: aw son of a bitch
[2017-01-04 19:41:57 UTC] n0_h3r0: ITS WAS ME ALL ALONG

[2017-01-04 19:42:24 UTC] bethe2670: you just made the list!!
[2017-01-04 19:42:48 UTC] theycallmejimbob: wow hating on Phil's gameplay is one thing but to try and alter nightbot commands to reveal info about his personal life and family.Lowest of the low.
[2017-01-04 19:42:54 UTC] bethe2670: /me writes asshole/carl/marle/he-she on the list
[2017-01-04 19:43:02 UTC] kingjadvcmp: yeah altering nightbot, it's like murder
[2017-01-04 19:43:22 UTC] bethe2670: hey i gotta cover all the bases
[2017-01-04 19:43:24 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @KingjadVCMP, Well, I mean people have tried killing Phil by swatting him, so...
[2017-01-04 19:43:27 UTC] mylthazz: if i worked for the FBI i would bring nightbot in for questioning just to cover all my bases
[2017-01-04 19:43:30 UTC] aglet57: wait they were revealing personal info? I thought it was just derailing and spamming the chat, no?
[2017-01-04 19:43:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: to reveal info about his personal life and family isn't bad KingjadVCMP ?
[2017-01-04 19:43:43 UTC] thecowboyboyfromhell213: @Mylthazz good thing he called the cops beforehand huh
[2017-01-04 19:43:43 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @AGLET57, There were photos of his family in some of the commands.
[2017-01-04 19:43:51 UTC] nerv117: revealing info could have killed him dspWowdude dspSurpriseddsp
[2017-01-04 19:43:53 UTC] aglet57: that's messed up

[2017-01-04 19:44:23 UTC] n0_h3r0: dspWowdude dspNothing
[2017-01-04 19:44:27 UTC] kingjadvcmp: personal info about Phil's life? The information is already out there dude.
[2017-01-04 19:44:29 UTC] bethe2670: they were posting it online
[2017-01-04 19:44:36 UTC] bethe2670: it was a load of fucking shit

[2017-01-04 19:44:46 UTC] thecowboyboyfromhell213: remember phil's recent house tour?
[2017-01-04 19:44:50 UTC] mylthazz: they tried to kill him because he only got 5 hours of sleep and what if he crashes his car because he is so tired
[2017-01-04 19:44:52 UTC] thecowboyboyfromhell213: yeah
[2017-01-04 19:45:02 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @KingjadVCMP, Please don't tell me you're trying to defend the actions of sociopaths...
[2017-01-04 19:45:04 UTC] bethe2670: he isnt going out today i think
[2017-01-04 19:45:04 UTC] aglet57: I think we need to stop talking about this. If Phil comes in and we're going on an on, he's going to trigger and it's going to be a long prestream.
[2017-01-04 19:45:05 UTC] soulrider95: Mylthazz, he never leaves his house LUL
[2017-01-04 19:45:09 UTC] bethe2670: so no worries about that
[2017-01-04 19:45:11 UTC] n0_h3r0: "Its trash. It's all fucking trash!"-Bethe2670
[2017-01-04 19:45:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: didn't he say something about them having pics of his dad that weren't available online or something a long those lines
[2017-01-04 19:45:15 UTC] kingjadvcmp: all I said was I cannot believe this much fuss over nightbot.
[2017-01-04 19:45:18 UTC] bethe2670: yep no hero

[2017-01-04 19:45:31 UTC] thecowboyboyfromhell213: lol
[2017-01-04 19:45:50 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: Night bot sucks I just got here and he's trying to silence me
[2017-01-04 19:46:05 UTC] mylthazz: buffetcrayfish3 he's trying to keep the truth from coming out
[2017-01-04 19:46:05 UTC] kingjadvcmp: did you just assume Nightbot's gender?
[2017-01-04 19:46:06 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: How will anyone know about bugged mechanics if I can't tell them?
[2017-01-04 19:46:13 UTC] bethe2670: i am 100% loyal cause i wouldn't waste 6 pounds on a sub if i wasnt and you can believe that
[2017-01-04 19:46:16 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: Bugged nightbot mechanics...

[2017-01-04 19:46:56 UTC] aglet57: Wait, Marle PAID Phil to troll him?
[2017-01-04 19:46:56 UTC] thecowboyboyfromhell213: !LiquidMK
[2017-01-04 19:46:56 UTC] nightbot: The jackass who tried to overthrow DSP's stream chat by impersonating a woman for over 6 months. I think he really likes being a woman!

[2017-01-04 19:47:05 UTC] kingjadvcmp: has this turned into some sort of amusing Mexican standoff, people trying to justify how big a fan they are? calm down bethe
[2017-01-04 19:47:12 UTC] mylthazz: lets support phil by not cheering any bits today because if we do that sends a message that we support these terrorists

[2017-01-04 20:27:05 UTC] bethe2670: this is messed up on a huge scale
[2017-01-04 20:27:10 UTC] darksydephil: i guess they had a grudge against Gino for some reason lol
[2017-01-04 20:27:11 UTC] alldaythreeam: a year lol
[2017-01-04 20:27:12 UTC] wilkie1992: whats this about?
[2017-01-04 20:27:14 UTC] darksydephil: probably for kicking them from the chat
[2017-01-04 20:27:16 UTC] blue_blur64: If they were going to blame anyone you'd think they would try to blame me seeing as I'm a lead mod on the forums O_o

[2017-01-04 20:27:18 UTC] butter__my__bread: how do u know it took a year? it coukd of taken far less to plan simple commands
[2017-01-04 20:27:19 UTC] yacherdy: It couldn't have been a year because Phil has only been on Twitch for a month.
[2017-01-04 20:27:22 UTC] derichloveslemur: So Someone hacked the commands Phil
[2017-01-04 20:27:25 UTC] freshjiivetv: Phil said a uear

[2017-01-04 20:27:35 UTC] alldaythreeam: nobody here and the detractors had no idea he was going back on twitch though
[2017-01-04 20:27:42 UTC] aglet57: Gino should become a mod in their chat somehow. That would be EPICCC
[2017-01-04 20:27:48 UTC] n0_h3r0: Trying to frame my nigga gino smh
[2017-01-04 20:27:53 UTC] ginosaji48: lol
[2017-01-04 20:27:54 UTC] bethe2670: i feel really fucking bad for gino because he modded marle in the first place and had no clue what 'she' would eventually do

[2017-01-04 20:27:57 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it's not your fault Gino
[2017-01-04 20:27:59 UTC] bethe2670: messed up
[2017-01-04 20:28:02 UTC] drilbit777: Look lesson of the day is that don't ever trust girls on the internet
[2017-01-04 20:28:03 UTC] parkfiction: I don't think the plan was to stall the stream. Just to provoke a reaction from DSP.
[2017-01-04 20:28:03 UTC] zawarud00: Allday all that would matter is to get someone in the good graces of phill it doesnt matter where he streams
[2017-01-04 20:28:04 UTC] derichloveslemur: @shotinthedeep how are you doing my bro? @n0_h3r0 hope you're doing awesome bud. @theycallmejimbob hope you're doing awesome too.
[2017-01-04 20:28:05 UTC] n0_h3r0: They should mod me so I can ban everyone

[2017-01-04 20:28:14 UTC] neonbornspartan9: popsi
[2017-01-04 20:28:15 UTC] darksydephil: the best part about the whole thing was, it took a year of planning, and i could have just disabled it with a simple single click. I.e. turning off nightbot from the dashboard. it literally takes one second
[2017-01-04 20:28:22 UTC] hype348: The plan was to provoke a reaction, and it worked great apparently
[2017-01-04 20:28:24 UTC] bethe2670: i'd be another gino mod if i got modded
[2017-01-04 20:28:25 UTC] neonbornspartan9: you watch Evangelion, my nigga TriHard

[2017-01-04 20:28:57 UTC] freshjiivetv: But seriously tho, they couldn't have taken a year to plan it since no one knew you were going to return to twitch until 2 months ago.
[2017-01-04 20:29:05 UTC] jiv_: who were the mods that did that?
[2017-01-04 20:29:07 UTC] derichloveslemur: @theycallmejimbob so what is phil talking about you have any ideas bud?

[2017-01-04 20:29:12 UTC] bethe2670: trolls are the most stupid of people tbh
[2017-01-04 20:29:14 UTC] gergc5: a simple click almost kills you?
[2017-01-04 20:29:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: one of his mods went rogue Derichloveslemur he did a vlog about it

[2017-01-04 20:30:06 UTC] parkfiction: DSP your attempts to puppet master this situation don't really work. It was a harmless prank and you got baited into making a video like people showed up outside your house.
[2017-01-04 20:30:11 UTC] parkfiction: IMHO
[2017-01-04 20:30:12 UTC] zawarud00: Hivetv is another braindead detractor
[2017-01-04 20:30:13 UTC] zawarud00: sigh
[2017-01-04 20:30:14 UTC] gergc5: dsp has an axe behind the door lol
[2017-01-04 20:30:21 UTC] wilkie1992: theycallmejimbob should i start and watch phil or go get drunk.
[2017-01-04 20:30:21 UTC] gergc5: :D
[2017-01-04 20:30:22 UTC] freshjiivetv: I guess logic = detractor
[2017-01-04 20:30:26 UTC] clesstheangel: just so you know, the reason they mentioned Ginosaji is cause no one likes him there. He's just a bad mod in general
[2017-01-04 20:30:26 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob and you suspected me of the one to turn heel how dare you sir
[2017-01-04 20:30:26 UTC] darksydephil: do you seriously think they could ever have girlfriends when they spent 2 straight years elaborately planning shit like this?
[2017-01-04 20:30:33 UTC] theycallmejimbob: wilkie1992, go get drunk mate :P
[2017-01-04 20:30:33 UTC] darksydephil: no woman who is sane would be with someone like that
[2017-01-04 20:30:40 UTC] n0_h3r0: @parkfiction, Bro thems fightin words. See me in the streets.
[2017-01-04 20:30:42 UTC] derichloveslemur: @theycallmejimbob so someone went rouge on something?
[2017-01-04 20:30:45 UTC] g4spharaoh: Is marle unmodded?
[2017-01-04 20:30:47 UTC] octoppedree: stuck his dick in crazy smh
[2017-01-04 20:30:52 UTC] derichloveslemur: You have any clue what it is @theycallmejimbob bud?
[2017-01-04 20:30:53 UTC] zawarud00: I highly doubt any detractor has ever talked to a girl before
[2017-01-04 20:30:53 UTC] butter__my__bread: nightbot is a detractor
[2017-01-04 20:30:54 UTC] bethe2670: they could hide it....but they are stupid so maybe nt
[2017-01-04 20:30:56 UTC] alldaythreeam: this music is relaxing
[2017-01-04 20:30:56 UTC] blue_blur64: Marle is gone forever Pharaoh
[2017-01-04 20:30:58 UTC] hype348: I mean it was obviously just to provoke a reaction, it doesn't matter if they actually did the thing, they still got the reaction
[2017-01-04 20:30:59 UTC] derichloveslemur: Hey @g4spharaoh
[2017-01-04 20:31:04 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I apologise bethe2670 you'd tell me if you were gonna do a heel turn...wouldn't you?
[2017-01-04 20:31:05 UTC] lemonplaysgames: And of course, tyou'll see the very same people coming in here probably throughout the stream trying to justify their actions by comparing it to murder.
[2017-01-04 20:31:09 UTC] aglet57: What does Freedom Chat even mean, anyway?
[2017-01-04 20:31:12 UTC] mrsbroadchester_69: Wait Marle as in that mod that loved DSP? Wait what?

[2017-01-04 20:31:16 UTC] nocturnesaberz: How could it have been planned for over 2 years if Phil just came back to twitch??
[2017-01-04 20:31:19 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob of course :P
[2017-01-04 20:31:20 UTC] zawarud00: Hell one of the detractors had to hook up with some cancer patient thats how desperate he was

[2017-01-04 20:31:36 UTC] freshjiivetv: that's the logical conclusion @nocturnesaberz but logic isn't allowed here.
[2017-01-04 20:31:44 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Bobbi called it that Marle was sok in fairness why didn't we listen :(
[2017-01-04 20:31:45 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: Have we done a prestream yet?
[2017-01-04 20:31:46 UTC] bethe2670: well we be talking about important shit
[2017-01-04 20:31:48 UTC] g4spharaoh: Phil needs a new mod then I guess
[2017-01-04 20:31:51 UTC] derichloveslemur: @theycallmejimbob oh it's the latest vid on his channel. Can you whisper me the link bud?
[2017-01-04 20:31:53 UTC] g4spharaoh: Keepo
[2017-01-04 20:32:01 UTC] n0_h3r0: @zawarud00, Bro that's messed up. Don't bring people with cancer into this. Thats not right.
[2017-01-04 20:32:01 UTC] mrsbroadchester_69: Cancer patient? What are you guys talking about?
[2017-01-04 20:32:01 UTC] derichloveslemur: @g4spharaoh hey bud how's you're day been?
[2017-01-04 20:32:02 UTC] zawarud00: Freshive you are literally the dumbest one here
[2017-01-04 20:32:03 UTC] cinsolace: you should stop the temper phil, you stay reacting they stay attacking but your a grown man, do you
[2017-01-04 20:32:03 UTC] ibedavey: evening gents

[2017-01-04 20:32:25 UTC] havenmonahan: @cinsolace and KiwiFarms will have a field day with this
[2017-01-04 20:32:27 UTC] shotinthedeep: This is really suprising
[2017-01-04 20:32:32 UTC] pwnage_101: Hi everyone. How is everyone doing?
[2017-01-04 20:32:33 UTC] captainpower94: I like that you guys say their plan failed, but all anyone's talking about today is the detractors and their little plan.
[2017-01-04 20:32:36 UTC] gergc5: finally
[2017-01-04 20:32:38 UTC] g4spharaoh: @Derichloveslemur @Derichloveslemur ;)

[2017-01-04 20:32:45 UTC] popsicolo: and how it failed
[2017-01-04 20:32:46 UTC] yacherdy: @Smittenkitten95 Unfortunately this comes with DSP and his "detractors" a lot of the time. It's annoying but it is what it is.
[2017-01-04 20:32:46 UTC] mrsbroadchester_69: Don't Freedom Chat people read this chat on their stream too?
[2017-01-04 20:32:49 UTC] shotinthedeep: Thought there was something odd about Marle but never expected anything like this
[2017-01-04 20:32:53 UTC] n0_h3r0: POSTGAME LETS GO
[2017-01-04 20:32:57 UTC] derichloveslemur: @g4spharaoh you're da best and really awesome for saying my name.
[2017-01-04 20:32:59 UTC] ginosaji48: so when is the poll about new playthrough coming up ?
[2017-01-04 20:33:00 UTC] thisguyluis: i'll never be a fan of dsp with people like zawarud00 representing the fanbase
[2017-01-04 20:33:01 UTC] bethe2670: deep they why didnt you say
[2017-01-04 20:33:02 UTC] sonicwe: phil quick tip this pokemon is a story based so just through a quick ball

[2017-01-04 20:33:16 UTC] n0_h3r0: cheer40 that's all I got bro
[2017-01-04 20:33:18 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: He already said he's doing Monster Hunter, not RDR or DA
[2017-01-04 20:33:21 UTC] bethe2670: i dont remember phil saying anything about a poll
[2017-01-04 20:33:22 UTC] shotinthedeep: Well, I didn't suspect Marle was a troll though
[2017-01-04 20:33:26 UTC] g4spharaoh: Phil, you dont have anything else to do. do the damn postgame for us that want to see it
[2017-01-04 20:33:28 UTC] soulrider95: bethe2670, it's not the viewers job to report on who they think is a "troll" lmfao
[2017-01-04 20:33:32 UTC] ginosaji48: idk phil said he will play either rdr or ds1
[2017-01-04 20:33:33 UTC] gergc5: the business is falling down :o
[2017-01-04 20:33:33 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @captainpower94, Because it's what no lives do and it's interesting to talk about.
[2017-01-04 20:33:37 UTC] alldaythreeam: please play the simpsons hit and run
[2017-01-04 20:33:40 UTC] havenmonahan: double standard: He plays all the FFXV side material as part of a review, but not pokemon moon?
[2017-01-04 20:33:49 UTC] ginosaji48: so i thought there will be a poll bethe
[2017-01-04 20:33:54 UTC] havenmonahan: and it only took since Nov. 16 since he kept putting it on the backburner
[2017-01-04 20:33:56 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Eddy is a modern day Paul Revere if he didn't spam the chat, their dastardly plan would never of been revealed
[2017-01-04 20:33:58 UTC] bethe2670: saul i see you in the troll chat too dont think i didnt
[2017-01-04 20:33:59 UTC] jiv_: @freshjiivetv Phil discovered their website; they spent over a year stalking his streams and planning it; that's what Phil meant.
[2017-01-04 20:34:01 UTC] derichloveslemur: Guys chant Pokémon hype!
[2017-01-04 20:34:03 UTC] encelor: what post content is left with phils pkmn game?
[2017-01-04 20:34:06 UTC] zawarud00: All i know is i hope the detractors never have their life financially ruined
[2017-01-04 20:34:06 UTC] masterswielder: Anyone watch Wrestle Kingdom 11 last night?
[2017-01-04 20:34:15 UTC] wilkie1992: phil could come back to the post game stuff in a marthon with omeaga ruby and this
[2017-01-04 20:34:17 UTC] gergc5: "honest"
[2017-01-04 20:34:18 UTC] g4spharaoh: Just because it doesnt "get views" you shouldnt negelct it phil. come on dude
[2017-01-04 20:34:24 UTC] yacherdy: Anyways..time to move on. It was a prank but wasn't going to seriously hurt anyone and the "threat" has been squashed before it could take place so yeah. Nothing more to say.

[2017-01-04 20:34:58 UTC] parkfiction: The Eddys were trolls. KingJad, however, is armed and with nefarious intent.
[2017-01-04 20:35:01 UTC] encelor: Zubat call's for help.... no one showed up...no one liked zubat
