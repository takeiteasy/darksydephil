[2017-01-08 22:57:48 UTC] raptorbread: Bloodborne was great because it didn't have a large selection of weapons. The majority of DS weapons are pretty useless
[2017-01-08 22:57:48 UTC] akioartorius: hydra and giant knights

[2017-01-08 22:58:07 UTC] butter__my__bread: the lore and atmosphere of dark souls is my fave but Bloodborne is more fun to play
[2017-01-08 22:58:07 UTC] lokizarro: It limited builds, which limited the game in general and the replayability factor
[2017-01-08 22:58:09 UTC] bethe2670: i wont deny that
[2017-01-08 22:58:12 UTC] raptorbread: Pretty much every weapon in bloodborne was viable
[2017-01-08 22:58:13 UTC] lokizarro: No themed builds at all allowed
[2017-01-08 22:58:23 UTC] lokizarro: So are weapons in Dark 1 with very rare exceptions
[2017-01-08 22:58:28 UTC] popsicolo: This is what happens to you when you smoke weed.
[2017-01-08 22:58:28 UTC] bobbi_ling: capra way? Kreygasm
[2017-01-08 22:58:45 UTC] raptorbread: DS3 is the most limiting when it comes to builds, but thats just because of the way scaling works now
[2017-01-08 22:58:46 UTC] warrock333: Wait until reddit hears about this Phil!
[2017-01-08 22:58:48 UTC] damdann: Stop reading stream chat you said you wouldn't

[2017-01-08 22:59:04 UTC] butter__my__bread: bb had some 15 new weapons added with its expansion. Don't underestimate Arcane builds, theyre very fun
[2017-01-08 22:59:06 UTC] lokizarro: anyway*
[2017-01-08 22:59:18 UTC] agentmainez: 5 fps in blighttown on 360
[2017-01-08 22:59:19 UTC] gaylordbutthump: yeah, DS3 is pretty much all quality builds if you want to be melee
[2017-01-08 22:59:21 UTC] thesaurusboy: i was rooting for the cannabis!
[2017-01-08 22:59:22 UTC] lokizarro: I did an arcane build, had almost 50 in the stat, wasn't satisfied at all
[2017-01-08 22:59:23 UTC] supers18: what happened to marle?
[2017-01-08 22:59:25 UTC] theycallmejimbob: what does reverse hollowing do
[2017-01-08 22:59:35 UTC] snuffed: arcane builds are only good with > 50 in the stat
[2017-01-08 22:59:36 UTC] x_tic: it's a tie between this and bb for me, I hate dks 2 and 3
[2017-01-08 22:59:41 UTC] snuffed: you really want 80-100
[2017-01-08 22:59:46 UTC] snuffed: its the only stat thats like that
[2017-01-08 22:59:47 UTC] saintanti: LUL
[2017-01-08 22:59:50 UTC] darkandfullofterrors: x_tic, how can you hate ds3? it was sick as fuck
[2017-01-08 22:59:58 UTC] lokizarro: BB is still a better effort than Dark 2 and 3, BB at least tried to be new, Dark 2 and 3 try so hard to recapture the spirit of the first and fail so hard.
[2017-01-08 23:00:01 UTC] vapenation42069: Did he beat gargoyles?

[2017-01-08 23:00:07 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yes
[2017-01-08 23:00:10 UTC] raptorbread: Yeah I'll give you that. Arcane is mainly a substat. Tools don't work well unless you have a LOT invested
[2017-01-08 23:00:13 UTC] neonbornspartan9: I just like bloodbornes theme, atmosphere, setting, and enemy design
[2017-01-08 23:00:14 UTC] humpiershaggy: They all are
[2017-01-08 23:00:22 UTC] gaylordbutthump: DS2 had such a messed up development is probably why it got fucked
[2017-01-08 23:00:24 UTC] damdann: Ds2 pvp was too easy
[2017-01-08 23:00:31 UTC] vapenation42069: Did he cheat Kappa
[2017-01-08 23:00:32 UTC] butter__my__bread: @lokizarro the tools all have S scaling so going to 99 is the hard cap and 70 was reportedly the soft. the new tools in old hunters were also very fun
[2017-01-08 23:00:34 UTC] lokizarro: Yeah, DS2 was screwed up indeed.
[2017-01-08 23:00:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: sneaky sneaky

[2017-01-08 23:01:04 UTC] bethe2670: hello dragin
[2017-01-08 23:01:05 UTC] baumer_man: There's also SFV
[2017-01-08 23:01:08 UTC] lokizarro: DS3 also re-treaded the lore far too much rather than trying to do its own thing
[2017-01-08 23:01:09 UTC] butter__my__bread: i have an arcane toon w 99 arcane it its fun times in both PvP and PvE
[2017-01-08 23:01:11 UTC] pedoprinz: >tfw you have no father FellsBadMan
[2017-01-08 23:01:11 UTC] humpiershaggy: How the hell do you cheat at DS? Using summons is a game mechanic.

[2017-01-08 23:01:30 UTC] gaylordbutthump: @raptorbread agreed, those are the two reasons i have such trouble replaying it, it's the same stuff in almost the same order every time
[2017-01-08 23:01:30 UTC] raptorbread: I hated the fact that they completely ignored DS2 Lore

[2017-01-08 23:02:04 UTC] feignit: DSP is a pro and doesnt need summons dspHmm
[2017-01-08 23:02:07 UTC] lokizarro: In regards to BB scaling, I invested a lot into an arcane build and wasn't satisfied, the whole scaling to NG+ was changed too and it felt more grindy and boring.
[2017-01-08 23:02:07 UTC] pedoprinz: ya he did
[2017-01-08 23:02:07 UTC] lefilthycasul: yes
[2017-01-08 23:02:11 UTC] gndorky: ok ta
[2017-01-08 23:02:15 UTC] raptorbread: Lack of poise also meant there wasn't much point in using heavy weapons since you could breeze through the game spamming R1
[2017-01-08 23:02:26 UTC] lokizarro: The feeling of power you get in DS1 is great when you advance and make a build correctly.
[2017-01-08 23:02:31 UTC] raptorbread: Also you leveled extremely slow in DS3
[2017-01-08 23:02:43 UTC] lokizarro: The poise issue in DS3 is beyond a joke
[2017-01-08 23:02:49 UTC] damdann: I miss the running around and not teleing part of dark souls
[2017-01-08 23:02:50 UTC] lokizarro: I can't believe they forgot that lmao
[2017-01-08 23:02:57 UTC] damdann: teleing makes it too fast paced
[2017-01-08 23:02:58 UTC] gaylordbutthump: leveling extremely slow is also why mages feel so miserable to play because you're not good until high levels]
[2017-01-08 23:02:59 UTC] wildlifechris: there was no poin tto use anything but fast weapons in ds3

[2017-01-08 23:15:01 UTC] darksydephil: i guess i missed it, who was that?
[2017-01-08 23:15:11 UTC] apollojusticeisfine: Gineriella I think
[2017-01-08 23:15:12 UTC] mattebengt: AB+ introduced quite a few new bugs and some rooms are impossible to clear without taking damage. @Baumer_Man
[2017-01-08 23:15:20 UTC] gineriella: I'm here to chat
[2017-01-08 23:15:23 UTC] lokizarro: Phil, be sure to check what the spear scales with again, just a suggestion, not helping! :x
[2017-01-08 23:15:24 UTC] put_saber_in_melty_blood: saying that chun li was good, GTAB
[2017-01-08 23:15:29 UTC] gineriella: i've just discovered Phil and am interested in him
[2017-01-08 23:15:33 UTC] darksydephil: spear scales with strength and dex i thought?
[2017-01-08 23:15:37 UTC] lokizarro: Phil is an interesting human
[2017-01-08 23:15:39 UTC] darksydephil: fuck i hope so, i just leveled strength twice
[2017-01-08 23:15:41 UTC] klask879: that one fan art was done well for once SeemsGood
[2017-01-08 23:15:41 UTC] g4spharaoh: im just looking out for the well being of this stream
[2017-01-08 23:15:42 UTC] gineriella: he def is
[2017-01-08 23:15:42 UTC] raptorbread: It does.
[2017-01-08 23:15:45 UTC] lokizarro: Spear is B with Dex which is much better
[2017-01-08 23:15:48 UTC] gineriella: i'm not here to be a dick
[2017-01-08 23:15:49 UTC] emnay_i_say: Depends on your spear, Phil.
[2017-01-08 23:15:49 UTC] lokizarro: It's not the best with Str
[2017-01-08 23:15:50 UTC] darksydephil: shit ok
[2017-01-08 23:15:53 UTC] darksydephil: ill level dex next then

[2017-01-08 23:16:01 UTC] gineriella: thanks @bethe2670 ;)
[2017-01-08 23:16:02 UTC] lokizarro: Winged Spear is good with Dex Ya :)
[2017-01-08 23:16:04 UTC] octoberfleshed: should just be doing endurance
[2017-01-08 23:16:05 UTC] bethe2670: i watch her vids on youtube
[2017-01-08 23:16:07 UTC] point_down_gesture: phil can write?
[2017-01-08 23:16:09 UTC] lonewolfwarrior93x: If he's working with Dex he'll want the Silver Knight Spear later on.
[2017-01-08 23:16:09 UTC] darksydephil: i seriously like this spear
[2017-01-08 23:16:11 UTC] raptorbread: Spears work better if they're enchanted IMO
[2017-01-08 23:16:11 UTC] emnay_i_say: The winged spear is I believe a quality weapon, but takes more on dex.
[2017-01-08 23:16:12 UTC] octoberfleshed: until you get a weapon you actually want to keep
[2017-01-08 23:16:15 UTC] emnay_i_say: If I recall.
[2017-01-08 23:16:15 UTC] darksydephil: way diff than using swords like i always have
[2017-01-08 23:16:15 UTC] mightysandwich: mscupHi
[2017-01-08 23:16:18 UTC] lokizarro: You can stick with that bad boy the whole game, seriously, the game is designed well like that
[2017-01-08 23:16:20 UTC] garlicpepper: Im happy phil didn't get drake sword
[2017-01-08 23:16:23 UTC] manphred: the lightning spear in sens fortress is great, too
[2017-01-08 23:16:24 UTC] coldkiller86: phil when you run past stuff why do you start blaming the game and not yourself when it is clearly you who fucked up?
[2017-01-08 23:16:26 UTC] raptorbread: Spears are a lot of fun.
[2017-01-08 23:16:31 UTC] lokizarro: Spears are good shit
[2017-01-08 23:16:32 UTC] darksydephil: shit
[2017-01-08 23:16:35 UTC] darksydephil: my batteries are low
[2017-01-08 23:16:39 UTC] lokizarro: Turtling is fun too.
[2017-01-08 23:16:39 UTC] darksydephil: let me get mor eand then we'll resume
[2017-01-08 23:16:40 UTC] darksydephil: brb
[2017-01-08 23:16:41 UTC] yaromesky: DSP beats game legit on his own!!! No handholding!
[2017-01-08 23:16:41 UTC] octoberfleshed: spears are for scrubs
[2017-01-08 23:16:44 UTC] klask879: get the astora straight sword and make into a raw weapon the its good

[2017-01-08 23:16:48 UTC] slowbrosif: wtf I thought no handholding
[2017-01-08 23:16:49 UTC] dolski_: Don't scale resistance it's pointless
[2017-01-08 23:16:52 UTC] gineriella: i'm figuring out how to do more streaming on twitch
[2017-01-08 23:16:55 UTC] alex_dragonul: lol at people arguing with is better or not , i say all are great in their own ways and a fun experience done
[2017-01-08 23:16:58 UTC] coodybaroody: Wasn't this playthrough meant to be WITHOUT fans handholding?
[2017-01-08 23:17:01 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: there have been minimal handholding this time
[2017-01-08 23:17:02 UTC] lokizarro: I just want to see him do all the challenges solo
[2017-01-08 23:17:03 UTC] gineriella: and do things like having subscribe buttons and what not
[2017-01-08 23:17:06 UTC] octoberfleshed: can't time your attacks properly, so you need to block while you attack
[2017-01-08 23:17:09 UTC] mightysandwich: You used a lightning spear in Sen's Fortress on your first run but a viewer gave you an amazing weapon that replaced it, Phil
[2017-01-08 23:17:10 UTC] spookywun: @slowbrosif, you thought LUL
[2017-01-08 23:17:12 UTC] lokizarro: I don't mind giving him little tips
[2017-01-08 23:17:16 UTC] psyoctopi: xbox with batteries DansGame DansGame
[2017-01-08 23:17:18 UTC] gazzonic: See you shortly Kappa
[2017-01-08 23:17:26 UTC] gineriella: it's all new to me so i'm interested in any kind of stream you feel me
[2017-01-08 23:17:28 UTC] raptorbread: He's actually doing this legitly
[2017-01-08 23:17:29 UTC] lokizarro: I just pointed out the scaling, it's up to him what he does with that
[2017-01-08 23:17:32 UTC] bethe2670: dspAngrydsp sub emotes are good too
[2017-01-08 23:17:35 UTC] raptorbread: So I'll give him that.
[2017-01-08 23:17:39 UTC] drilbit777: floe1 floe2
[2017-01-08 23:17:42 UTC] g4spharaoh: phil needs a sub badge
[2017-01-08 23:17:47 UTC] g4spharaoh: I mentioned that on the forums too
[2017-01-08 23:17:57 UTC] g4spharaoh: the star just isnt cutting it
[2017-01-08 23:17:58 UTC] podusmonens: yes bethe but not worth 5 per month
[2017-01-08 23:18:02 UTC] octoberfleshed: I agree with the pinned comment.
[2017-01-08 23:18:14 UTC] bethe2670: dragin no ads help that
[2017-01-08 23:18:16 UTC] podusmonens: 4.99 sry
[2017-01-08 23:18:16 UTC] spookywun: these emotes need to be cleaned up
[2017-01-08 23:18:18 UTC] slowbrosif: all the previously knowledge he gained from people telling him what to do invalidates anything he does now, no matter what it is impossible to call this playthrough "legitimate"
[2017-01-08 23:18:18 UTC] raptorbread: He seems to have a better attitude in these streams
[2017-01-08 23:18:21 UTC] octoberfleshed: Redemption runs of Persona and Scarface. Don't be a pussy.
[2017-01-08 23:18:33 UTC] bethe2670: dragin or 4.80 for me :P
[2017-01-08 23:18:37 UTC] g4spharaoh: "redemption run" should be a new series or patron goal
[2017-01-08 23:18:40 UTC] lefilthycasul: The Old Hunter redemption run?
[2017-01-08 23:18:41 UTC] gineriella: i hope so
[2017-01-08 23:18:42 UTC] shotinthedeep: This is a redemption run, but he's getting help from the chat
[2017-01-08 23:18:46 UTC] gineriella: is Phil self-aware these days
[2017-01-08 23:18:46 UTC] podusmonens: brosif got mushed
[2017-01-08 23:18:48 UTC] knightmare_29: @slowbrosif he doesnt remember a large portion of the game
[2017-01-08 23:18:52 UTC] gineriella: cz that's how it seems
[2017-01-08 23:18:55 UTC] g4spharaoh: phil isnt stupid lol
[2017-01-08 23:19:00 UTC] evilhenchman: I'm confused, is this a second playthrough?
[2017-01-08 23:19:01 UTC] g4spharaoh: he's an intelligent guy
[2017-01-08 23:19:04 UTC] klask879: good lord scarface is a glitchy mess but will be worth seeing again i guess
[2017-01-08 23:19:06 UTC] lokizarro: He's getting little tips, telling him about scaling isn't directly helping him with encounters and such, it's up to him what he does with the knowledge.
[2017-01-08 23:19:09 UTC] darksydephil: minor help is ok, huge spoilers are a no no
[2017-01-08 23:19:11 UTC] mattebengt: @G4SPharaoh, LUL
[2017-01-08 23:19:11 UTC] bethe2670: dragin also its actually 6 bucks because of 1 whole dollar tax
[2017-01-08 23:19:14 UTC] raptorbread: Old Hunters DLC subgoal
[2017-01-08 23:19:15 UTC] schmoopster: is there anywhere i can buy this artwork in a larger print?
[2017-01-08 23:19:16 UTC] shotinthedeep: oh ok
[2017-01-08 23:19:26 UTC] g4spharaoh: @MatteBengt dspWowdude
[2017-01-08 23:19:35 UTC] gineriella: it's cool to engage with your subscribers
[2017-01-08 23:19:36 UTC] g4spharaoh: so many haters
[2017-01-08 23:19:44 UTC] sss_rank_genos: Bed of chaos
[2017-01-08 23:19:46 UTC] lokizarro: Enjoying the playthrough by the way, you are using the chat minimally which is good, but little tid bits for a game of this nature isn't the end of the world.
[2017-01-08 23:20:01 UTC] bethe2670: yeah that is what most twitch streamers do they interact with their chat
[2017-01-08 23:20:02 UTC] g4spharaoh: just let the man play the game how he wants
[2017-01-08 23:20:03 UTC] raptorbread: I'll give him credit too for tryng to figure out that jump on his own and not listening to chat
[2017-01-08 23:20:06 UTC] g4spharaoh: jesus christ
[2017-01-08 23:20:12 UTC] manphred: snort
[2017-01-08 23:20:12 UTC] nightbot: manphred -> Now now now, that isn't nice! [warning]
[2017-01-08 23:20:15 UTC] bethe2670: as well as stream whatever they are streaming

[2017-01-08 23:20:30 UTC] gineriella: Phil why are you always sick lol
[2017-01-08 23:20:46 UTC] bethe2670: he got it from his gf and she got it from work
[2017-01-08 23:20:49 UTC] lokizarro: raptorbread, while that was a bit annoying in the end, that's true, he's doing his own thing ultimately which is good.
[2017-01-08 23:20:51 UTC] gineriella: blah
[2017-01-08 23:20:52 UTC] g4spharaoh: phils immune system is hella weak
[2017-01-08 23:20:52 UTC] mxtt10589: cause he hasn't gotten his health inssurance yet to go to the doctors
[2017-01-08 23:20:56 UTC] coldkiller86: phil please stop blaming the game when you run past enemies and die like a tard cuz of your own dumbass need to rush
[2017-01-08 23:21:00 UTC] pissblast: 'his immune system is trash
[2017-01-08 23:21:01 UTC] stalkerstein: as if you guys didnt read the wiki or whatever whenever you played a souls game for the first time
[2017-01-08 23:21:04 UTC] g4spharaoh: him and leanna are perfect for each other
[2017-01-08 23:21:05 UTC] stalkerstein: so yeah stfu and let the man play
[2017-01-08 23:21:06 UTC] octoberfleshed: DarkSydePhil: The man with the weakest immune system in the world.
[2017-01-08 23:21:06 UTC] podusmonens: ban gineriella already
[2017-01-08 23:21:09 UTC] lokizarro: *Thumbs up*
[2017-01-08 23:21:16 UTC] g4spharaoh: both have bugged immune systems
[2017-01-08 23:21:17 UTC] bethe2670: dragin why

[2017-01-08 23:21:50 UTC] drilbit777: phil should clean his filters more often if he wants to be sick less
[2017-01-08 23:21:51 UTC] podusmonens: let him stay, have fun
[2017-01-08 23:21:53 UTC] mfd4419: Hi chat

[2017-01-08 23:22:13 UTC] octoberfleshed: @stalkerstein as much as they hate detractors they sure like to spend their time arguing and talking about them
[2017-01-08 23:22:14 UTC] sureflight: Phil levels dex, casual confirmed
[2017-01-08 23:22:14 UTC] bethe2670: trust me on this
[2017-01-08 23:22:17 UTC] shotinthedeep: Ahhh, another "girl"
[2017-01-08 23:22:19 UTC] g4spharaoh: gender doesnt matter in stream chat

[2017-01-08 23:22:26 UTC] g4spharaoh: everyone is "dude" here
