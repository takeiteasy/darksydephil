[2017-01-31 20:05:01 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: wow that was actually a pretty decent improvement
[2017-01-31 20:05:04 UTC] charizard545: thats some shit
[2017-01-31 20:05:16 UTC] charizard545: you should make the bronze look the same

[2017-01-31 20:05:31 UTC] darksydephil: yeah Pops redid the smallest version of the sub badges and they look far better now
[2017-01-31 20:05:38 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: the borders should be gone
[2017-01-31 20:05:39 UTC] bethe2670: question why does it need the background layer?
[2017-01-31 20:05:45 UTC] charizard545: bronze are still there
[2017-01-31 20:05:47 UTC] darksydephil: if you dont see a difference you probably dont use the smallest version. it depends on how big the chat is on your device
[2017-01-31 20:05:55 UTC] charizard545: o
[2017-01-31 20:05:55 UTC] ginosaji48: oh the silver badge looks different now

[2017-01-31 20:06:28 UTC] darksydephil: yeah pc tends to use the mid or high level badges and emotes
[2017-01-31 20:06:33 UTC] bethe2670: pops you should get rid of the background and then it can just be a crown or cant you do it
[2017-01-31 20:06:38 UTC] charizard545: arent most people watching twitch on pc
[2017-01-31 20:06:47 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh, I see now

[2017-01-31 20:10:00 UTC] fensthespook: That's rough
[2017-01-31 20:10:19 UTC] darksydephil: every single twitch streamer probably don't do their taxes properly, lol
[2017-01-31 20:10:19 UTC] fensthespook: I think bits are more fun anyway lol
[2017-01-31 20:10:25 UTC] spade137: paypal is shady af
[2017-01-31 20:10:31 UTC] theycallmejimbob: can't you use paypal to donate to his patreon?

[2017-01-31 20:10:41 UTC] charizard545: patreon isnt as cool as paypal
[2017-01-31 20:10:43 UTC] darksydephil: no lie, its pretty easy to say its "under the gift exemption" and not pay taxes on it. chances are most twitch streamers wont get audited
[2017-01-31 20:10:43 UTC] dxfreedom: I really wonder how Maximilliondood does it. The donation he gets are crazy
[2017-01-31 20:10:50 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: haha i would be very surprised if every person with a income on internet payed tax actually
[2017-01-31 20:10:51 UTC] fensthespook: Buy some bitz Charizard, then make it RAIINN

[2017-01-31 20:11:24 UTC] charizard545: yakuza games are my favorite franchise so il give u 1500 bits if you promise to do all 100 substories

[2017-01-31 20:12:05 UTC] dxfreedom: Yea I really have no clue how taxes work in your country and you should pick the save road. I just see some streamers racking in so much money and wonder how they can do that
[2017-01-31 20:12:05 UTC] darksydephil: i sought this guy out on purpose when this youtube thing got serious
[2017-01-31 20:12:07 UTC] bethe2670: bobbi :D
[2017-01-31 20:12:08 UTC] akioartorius: the f just happen?
[2017-01-31 20:12:31 UTC] darksydephil: if you just get funds pouring into your paypal without any kind of screen, or checks, its INCREDIBLy unsafe for taxes
[2017-01-31 20:12:36 UTC] blue_blur64: Hey guys, I'm adding a new command to the chat.

[2017-01-31 20:13:09 UTC] charizard545: i wish to give you dinero
[2017-01-31 20:13:10 UTC] darksydephil: like, if you dont have accountability of where your income is coming from, you could potentially get audited for thousands of dolalrs in back taxes. and the fees on that would be INSANE

[2017-01-31 20:15:19 UTC] darksydephil: spade, thats not true, it doesn't publicly show every single persons patreon contribution. and you can just make up any name if you dont want anybody to know you're a patron
[2017-01-31 20:15:20 UTC] dxfreedom: No joke, I have seen Maximiliondood get thousands of dollars donated on some of his twitch stream. I mean I am happy for him, I just wonder what method he is using to avoid the situation you are describing.

[2017-01-31 20:17:02 UTC] darksydephil: amazon owns twitch, so having to sign up is no surprise
[2017-01-31 20:17:06 UTC] popsicolo: I think the officers was looking for someone else though.
[2017-01-31 20:17:08 UTC] bethe2670: so they do pick on em

[2017-01-31 20:17:58 UTC] darksydephil: DXFreedom: setting up a totally new bank account and paypal would be a ton of work and costly too. they require a minimum balance and a set amount of time etc. I don't even have that much money to put into it honestly

[2017-01-31 20:22:43 UTC] dxfreedom: Yakuza is such a fun game

[2017-01-31 20:33:16 UTC] fensthespook: The graphics on his VR youtube looked horrible compared to the normal playthrough
[2017-01-31 20:33:24 UTC] phoenixrush85: Retroos I believe you
[2017-01-31 20:33:26 UTC] fensthespook: and the field of view was very small

[2017-01-31 20:33:33 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I think Phil needs to change some of his VR settings a bit. Last time I saw someone stream they had different settings.
[2017-01-31 20:33:34 UTC] dukesdearfreja: on VR
[2017-01-31 20:33:40 UTC] blue_blur64: Not even the point. Why play a persona game, finish it, then play another persona game soon after? It'd be tiring
[2017-01-31 20:33:45 UTC] fensthespook: Yeah some commentors mentioned the settings

[2017-01-31 20:34:16 UTC] dukesdearfreja: DSP should just do a full madhouse playthrough (non VR)
[2017-01-31 20:34:16 UTC] blue_blur64: Anyone would get burnt out playing multiple games in a series in a row
[2017-01-31 20:34:26 UTC] fensthespook: I'd like to see him do a Madhouse run too
[2017-01-31 20:34:27 UTC] popsicolo: Phil should do a dramatic reading of Persona x Detective Naoto KappaHD
[2017-01-31 20:34:29 UTC] phoenixrush85: I agree a madhouse run would do well I think
[2017-01-31 20:34:34 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh yeah, there's an Ethan must die difficulty in RE7's DLC :D

[2017-01-31 20:34:52 UTC] blue_blur64: And this difficulty can't be played with VR
[2017-01-31 20:34:53 UTC] lvlpower: how everyone
