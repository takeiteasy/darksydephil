[2017-01-10 18:55:49 UTC] whitewolf64: me
[2017-01-10 18:56:13 UTC] damdann: How's everybody doin
[2017-01-10 18:56:34 UTC] cnicks93: pretty good, i'm new to this dip fellow
[2017-01-10 18:56:44 UTC] cnicks93: dsp*
[2017-01-10 18:56:46 UTC] damdann: I love how salty he gets lol
[2017-01-10 18:56:53 UTC] cnicks93: sorry auto correct
[2017-01-10 18:57:01 UTC] damdann: No worry lol
[2017-01-10 18:57:34 UTC] cnicks93: lol I've only seen one of his streams, so he got salty last time lol
[2017-01-10 18:57:49 UTC] damdann: Yeah and he got his hand helded allot
[2017-01-10 18:58:18 UTC] damdann: Which is slightly understandable if he really is lost
[2017-01-10 18:58:30 UTC] damdann: But doing it all the time makes this like a stream plays dark souls
[2017-01-10 18:59:02 UTC] cnicks93: as i understand it, he tried dark souls before, but he had a lot of help?
[2017-01-10 18:59:12 UTC] damdann: Yeah he had summons I think
[2017-01-10 19:00:01 UTC] damdann: Thing is in this playthrough he keeps looking at chat but i'm okay with it if he's really having a hard time which seems like all the time lol
[2017-01-10 19:00:03 UTC] cnicks93: ohhh ok wow, i recently bought DS2 on xbox from the winter sale
[2017-01-10 19:00:12 UTC] cnicks93: lmao
[2017-01-10 19:00:14 UTC] damdann: DS2 is too easy lol
[2017-01-10 19:00:30 UTC] cnicks93: is it? i only ever played 1 and 3
[2017-01-10 19:00:46 UTC] damdann: Well DS2 is easy pvp wise
[2017-01-10 19:00:57 UTC] damdann: Cus the hitbox is insane and so unbalanced
[2017-01-10 19:01:07 UTC] cnicks93: i missed 2 somehow and then i saw the sale on xbox one lol
[2017-01-10 19:01:16 UTC] damdann: Lol
[2017-01-10 19:01:21 UTC] damdann: I liked the dlcs in ds2 though
[2017-01-10 19:01:35 UTC] jengarub: Compared to DS3? Idk, i've had some pretty crazy things happen on DS3
[2017-01-10 19:02:00 UTC] damdann: Ds3 is better to me cus in ds2 the fights are kinda fast
[2017-01-10 19:02:24 UTC] jengarub: I like both, but the pvp has always been a mixed bag for me
[2017-01-10 19:02:30 UTC] damdann: Yeah
[2017-01-10 19:02:39 UTC] cnicks93: i heard stuff about the hit boxes, and i'm curious as to what will happen as i play through it lol
[2017-01-10 19:02:46 UTC] damdann: The story and bosses were good but in dark souls 2 bosses were a tab easy
[2017-01-10 19:03:08 UTC] jengarub: Especially before SOTFS
[2017-01-10 19:03:52 UTC] cnicks93: anyone play bloodborne?
[2017-01-10 19:04:11 UTC] damdann: I liked bloodborne
[2017-01-10 19:04:12 UTC] jengarub: Oh yeah

[2017-01-10 19:04:19 UTC] jengarub: Ha
[2017-01-10 19:04:34 UTC] damdann: "frustration quit"
[2017-01-10 19:04:48 UTC] jengarub: That would be a real redemption run, imo
[2017-01-10 19:04:49 UTC] cnicks93: lol i'll have to watch him play that, i really like the old hunters dlc
[2017-01-10 19:05:01 UTC] damdann: Oh yeah I liked that dlc
[2017-01-10 19:05:07 UTC] damdann: The new weaps were pretty cool
[2017-01-10 19:05:21 UTC] cnicks93: I agree!
[2017-01-10 19:05:22 UTC] damdann: And the pvp was decent
[2017-01-10 19:05:33 UTC] jengarub: It was, actually, very fast
[2017-01-10 19:05:38 UTC] damdann: yeah

[2017-01-10 19:07:43 UTC] damdann: I think it was 4
[2017-01-10 19:07:46 UTC] jengarub: I think it was, I am not too familiar
[2017-01-10 19:07:57 UTC] damdann: it was the final boss who kept making his allies heal the boss
[2017-01-10 19:08:29 UTC] jengarub: Just did a quick search, it was 3
[2017-01-10 19:08:33 UTC] damdann: Oh okay
[2017-01-10 19:08:44 UTC] jengarub: Funny as hell though
[2017-01-10 19:08:48 UTC] damdann: He played on easy mode right?
[2017-01-10 19:08:55 UTC] jengarub: I think so, lol
[2017-01-10 19:08:57 UTC] damdann: Lmao
[2017-01-10 19:09:07 UTC] cnicks93: i feel like there would be a way to not make the boss have your allies heal it lol some item or something
[2017-01-10 19:09:22 UTC] damdann: I wouldn't have any healers honestly if he can do thta
[2017-01-10 19:09:30 UTC] damdann: I would just use healing items
[2017-01-10 19:09:45 UTC] damdann: and defense buffs
[2017-01-10 19:09:50 UTC] cnicks93: True
[2017-01-10 19:10:11 UTC] damdann: "I can be good at games if I want to"
[2017-01-10 19:10:31 UTC] jengarub: C'mon "It's not his fault"

[2017-01-10 19:13:40 UTC] cnicks93: i believe it was when he was playing street fighter 5
[2017-01-10 19:13:52 UTC] damdann: I'm kinda sure he lied to make himself look better but idk
[2017-01-10 19:14:15 UTC] damdann: Street fighter turbo I think it was

[2017-01-10 19:16:39 UTC] jengarub: I definitely don't have anything against him, but you can tell when he is full of it
[2017-01-10 19:16:42 UTC] cnicks93: what happened that made him what he is now?
[2017-01-10 19:17:10 UTC] damdann: Well he moved to washington and got into drama with rambo cus he wasn't paying them enough

[2017-01-10 19:17:42 UTC] cnicks93: Phil wasn't paying him enough?
[2017-01-10 19:17:56 UTC] damdann: Like when they do collabs or something they split money
[2017-01-10 19:18:13 UTC] cnicks93: ohh

[2017-01-10 19:18:41 UTC] mohpreacher: I was just seeing your conversation guys, and i miss old phil too
[2017-01-10 19:19:10 UTC] jengarub: I think a lot of people do, he just pissed off to many people, his old fans, etc
[2017-01-10 19:19:20 UTC] damdann: I think if he stayed in the state he was still in but got a better house there he'd prob do better
[2017-01-10 19:19:30 UTC] mohpreacher: now he just bitches about every game and dont even try to play them properly
[2017-01-10 19:19:37 UTC] damdann: True
[2017-01-10 19:20:13 UTC] jengarub: Should be streaming soon, yeah?
[2017-01-10 19:20:20 UTC] damdann: About 40 min
[2017-01-10 19:20:41 UTC] damdann: I don't hate phil just he gets full of it sometimes
[2017-01-10 19:20:44 UTC] jengarub: Coo', the best part of this "Redemption Run" is the stream chat, honestly
[2017-01-10 19:20:47 UTC] mohpreacher: I can see already he overleveling in ds and looking at guides to go the right
[2017-01-10 19:21:01 UTC] damdann: And stream chat holding his hand
[2017-01-10 19:21:12 UTC] jengarub: Lol, when he got to ash lake
[2017-01-10 19:21:19 UTC] bethe2670: hello everyone
[2017-01-10 19:21:25 UTC] jengarub: Didn't sit at the bonfire, jeez

[2017-01-10 19:21:33 UTC] cnicks93: lol
[2017-01-10 19:21:34 UTC] damdann: And he has the black knight halberd which is gonna make him breeze the game easy
[2017-01-10 19:21:36 UTC] mohpreacher: I dont hate him too, I just want him to be a man and say he cant do shit without help in this game
[2017-01-10 19:21:41 UTC] damdann: Ikr
[2017-01-10 19:21:41 UTC] mohpreacher: hey bethe
[2017-01-10 19:21:50 UTC] damdann: If he was more honest he'd say that lol
[2017-01-10 19:21:53 UTC] bethe2670: true he cant do anything without help
[2017-01-10 19:22:08 UTC] cnicks93: So in his redemption run, he still gets help?
[2017-01-10 19:22:26 UTC] damdann: I can see phil as a cool guy just gets too much with the shit
[2017-01-10 19:22:32 UTC] jengarub: Yup. because dak souls is too "cryptic"
[2017-01-10 19:22:34 UTC] mohpreacher: thats all I and other people want, him to man up and accept his mistakes
[2017-01-10 19:22:45 UTC] damdann: Same @MOHpreacher
[2017-01-10 19:23:14 UTC] cnicks93: He starts at 3pm EST right?
[2017-01-10 19:23:20 UTC] damdann: Like every death its "Wow I couldn't do anything the camera fucked up"
[2017-01-10 19:23:33 UTC] mohpreacher: when i played it the first time, I got so fucked with my character that I had to create another lol
[2017-01-10 19:23:47 UTC] damdann: He can't simply say "oh that was my fault my bad I shoulda known that would happen"
[2017-01-10 19:23:49 UTC] bethe2670: this was meant to be a NO EXCUSES, NO HANDHOLDING, NO SUMMONS
[2017-01-10 19:24:04 UTC] bethe2670: but he already failed 2 of those
[2017-01-10 19:24:10 UTC] jengarub: Gosh, I can't count on my hands how many times I restarted all the souls games
[2017-01-10 19:24:22 UTC] bethe2670: i think there was a 4th thing which he also failed
[2017-01-10 19:24:32 UTC] damdann: I had to play dark souls with no guide when I started
[2017-01-10 19:24:38 UTC] mohpreacher: I never used a guide man, why does he need to
[2017-01-10 19:24:46 UTC] damdann: Guides ruin it honestly
[2017-01-10 19:24:46 UTC] bethe2670: damdann didnt everyone
[2017-01-10 19:24:48 UTC] jengarub: Same
[2017-01-10 19:25:04 UTC] bethe2670: he isnt using a guide he is using stream chat
[2017-01-10 19:25:11 UTC] cnicks93: Has he done any summons on this run?
[2017-01-10 19:25:16 UTC] bethe2670: not yet
[2017-01-10 19:25:23 UTC] damdann: Like if its to to this certain quest i don't mind but when its about the area that gets me lol
[2017-01-10 19:25:25 UTC] bethe2670: that is his last chance
[2017-01-10 19:25:30 UTC] jengarub: It's hard for me to believe people still buy strategy guides, at least in this day
[2017-01-10 19:25:39 UTC] bethe2670: i dont
[2017-01-10 19:25:41 UTC] damdann: I don't
[2017-01-10 19:25:46 UTC] damdann: I just play it and go with it lol
[2017-01-10 19:25:49 UTC] bethe2670: cause you could just look it up honestly
[2017-01-10 19:26:00 UTC] bethe2670: not that i would
[2017-01-10 19:26:02 UTC] mohpreacher: if the point was "get every mothfkin item in the game" it would be fine
[2017-01-10 19:26:45 UTC] damdann: I would look up the character quests that's pretty much it not get the best items to rush the game
[2017-01-10 19:26:46 UTC] bethe2670: the point of this playthrough is a REDEMPTION RUN and he has failed at least 2 of HIS own 3 rules
[2017-01-10 19:26:49 UTC] jengarub: Lol, going in blind was honestly very immersive
[2017-01-10 19:26:51 UTC] mohpreacher: but he uses to beat the game, Im like, dude really?
[2017-01-10 19:27:05 UTC] damdann: I love blind runs
[2017-01-10 19:27:11 UTC] bethe2670: oh that was the 4th one he failed the NO SPOILERS because people be spoiling anyway
[2017-01-10 19:27:18 UTC] damdann: Watching streams of Blind runs is better
[2017-01-10 19:27:32 UTC] damdann: He should just turn off stream chat
[2017-01-10 19:27:43 UTC] bethe2670: no he wont ever do that
[2017-01-10 19:27:59 UTC] damdann: Or maybe like have a wall blocking the chat lol
[2017-01-10 19:28:00 UTC] mohpreacher: blind was really cool, when I got cursed I was like "half health????" lol
[2017-01-10 19:28:06 UTC] bethe2670: he tried it last year for a couple games and he probably didnt like it
[2017-01-10 19:28:12 UTC] bethe2670: so he wont do it again
[2017-01-10 19:28:20 UTC] damdann: He had to look it up himself without others doing it
[2017-01-10 19:28:39 UTC] bethe2670: phil was like that yesterday though he was surprised by half health
[2017-01-10 19:28:45 UTC] damdann: Lol
[2017-01-10 19:28:58 UTC] damdann: I liked when he died of the poison in his menu
[2017-01-10 19:29:02 UTC] damdann: Like dude with
[2017-01-10 19:29:06 UTC] damdann: wtf*
[2017-01-10 19:29:12 UTC] bethe2670: im just happy he is dying a lot otherwise i'd be bored as fuck
[2017-01-10 19:29:17 UTC] damdann: Same lol
[2017-01-10 19:29:26 UTC] mohpreacher: but he already knew about it bethe, because of the first run
[2017-01-10 19:29:56 UTC] damdann: He should change the title to "Blind playthrough after 5 years!!"
[2017-01-10 19:30:02 UTC] damdann: Not redemption run
[2017-01-10 19:30:03 UTC] mohpreacher: its impossible for him to beat O&S legit, just saying
[2017-01-10 19:30:09 UTC] bethe2670: half of yesterdays stream was him going to places waaaaay under leveled and doing nothing only for stream to help him find his way
[2017-01-10 19:30:35 UTC] bethe2670: true that he knew about curse
[2017-01-10 19:30:48 UTC] damdann: I am going to enjoy him playing anor londo
[2017-01-10 19:30:56 UTC] damdann: And sens fortress
[2017-01-10 19:31:10 UTC] mohpreacher: i got pissed when he entered in blighttown from the backdoor
[2017-01-10 19:31:12 UTC] jengarub: What was up with that acting yesterday when he hit the fake wall to get to ash lake? xD
[2017-01-10 19:31:29 UTC] damdann: It was so obv he faked that part
[2017-01-10 19:31:35 UTC] mohpreacher: I knew he was going to make a run for the bonfire
[2017-01-10 19:31:51 UTC] lazlowmcninja: He got shown how to get to ashlake, check his twitter ;)
[2017-01-10 19:31:59 UTC] damdann: Oh yeah I know lol
[2017-01-10 19:32:01 UTC] bethe2670: no no no phil is a NO BULLSHIT guy he didnt know Kappa
[2017-01-10 19:32:01 UTC] mohpreacher: ofc it was fake, who hits the same chest 3 times lol
[2017-01-10 19:32:07 UTC] jengarub: xD
[2017-01-10 19:32:16 UTC] jengarub: Right?!
[2017-01-10 19:32:22 UTC] bethe2670: mohpreacher he thought it was a trap
[2017-01-10 19:32:33 UTC] bethe2670: and he thought he missed it the first 2 times
[2017-01-10 19:32:39 UTC] damdann: He always assumes every chest is a mimic...
[2017-01-10 19:32:47 UTC] cnicks93: lol
[2017-01-10 19:32:49 UTC] damdann: Look at the chain dude its not hard
[2017-01-10 19:32:50 UTC] lazlowmcninja: the chain means its a mimic riiight
[2017-01-10 19:32:51 UTC] bethe2670: there is a reason for that
[2017-01-10 19:32:52 UTC] lazlowmcninja: riiiiiiiight
[2017-01-10 19:33:03 UTC] jengarub: Lol omg
[2017-01-10 19:33:12 UTC] mohpreacher: the problem is not him knowing laslow, its about admitting he knew about it and not faking
[2017-01-10 19:33:21 UTC] damdann: He needs glasses bad cus he can't tell the difference between a normal chest and a mimic
[2017-01-10 19:33:25 UTC] bethe2670: he doesnt know even though he played this 2 times before and played the other dark souls games
[2017-01-10 19:33:30 UTC] bethe2670: but still
[2017-01-10 19:33:34 UTC] mohpreacher: sure bethe, he surely thought that lol
[2017-01-10 19:33:56 UTC] lazlowmcninja: if hed just admit that he knows about ash lake and he wants to see what he was able to do there for funs, sure fine i can see that
[2017-01-10 19:33:58 UTC] bethe2670: he faked that part BUT he hasnt faked anything else yet
[2017-01-10 19:34:04 UTC] lazlowmcninja: but oopsie found ashlake lulz
[2017-01-10 19:34:21 UTC] damdann: Wow what is this place!!!
[2017-01-10 19:34:25 UTC] jengarub: He really shouldn't have to fake anything, just say you remember
[2017-01-10 19:34:28 UTC] damdann: Ash lake i don't remember this???
[2017-01-10 19:34:38 UTC] lazlowmcninja: woah a hydraa?

[2017-01-10 19:35:18 UTC] damdann: I bet his tv is actuall has that old tv style with the lines everywhere
[2017-01-10 19:35:29 UTC] damdann: I can't see dude
[2017-01-10 19:35:37 UTC] mohpreacher: he doesnt play right in front of it, so he misses ridiculous stuff
[2017-01-10 19:35:46 UTC] mohpreacher: lol
[2017-01-10 19:35:54 UTC] bethe2670: smh he mightve faked the secret walls but he did not fake the hydra or ash lake reaction i do not remember him EVER going there
[2017-01-10 19:36:01 UTC] bethe2670: so why would he remember it
[2017-01-10 19:36:24 UTC] damdann: I like how salty he gets from getting hit by anything
[2017-01-10 19:36:27 UTC] lazlowmcninja: he remembers it from a few hours before the stream *cough* twitter
[2017-01-10 19:37:00 UTC] bethe2670: its dark sould lol if you get hit whilst trying to get to a boss with full estus that sucks
[2017-01-10 19:37:21 UTC] bethe2670: twitter doesnt tel him everythin
[2017-01-10 19:37:21 UTC] damdann: His twitter thing on here should add "Tell me how to play by tweeting me!"

[2017-01-10 20:00:16 UTC] darksydephil: i honestly though that chest was teh end of it and accidentally hit that illusory wall, which was pretty crazy
[2017-01-10 20:00:18 UTC] bethe2670: quelaag will die today
[2017-01-10 20:00:19 UTC] yacherdy: What's the hardest boss in Dark Souls?

[2017-01-10 20:01:17 UTC] bethe2670: yeah right
[2017-01-10 20:01:25 UTC] spookywun: dsp being told about ash lake is not a big deal since he would probably never of founded on his own.
[2017-01-10 20:01:34 UTC] aleandspirits: agreed spooky
[2017-01-10 20:01:43 UTC] thermocrius: ash lake is pointless
[2017-01-10 20:01:49 UTC] agoodlook: did u guys see phil's new patreon goal?
[2017-01-10 20:01:51 UTC] yacherdy: Oh, btw ME: Andromeda will have no season pass. Obviously will have DLC though but at least you don't have to purchase a season pass to take a chance on DLC.
[2017-01-10 20:01:52 UTC] wicked__clown: how long till this starts?
[2017-01-10 20:01:59 UTC] thermocrius: no boss to suffer at, only hydra
[2017-01-10 20:02:03 UTC] thermocrius: -2 minutes
[2017-01-10 20:02:12 UTC] lokizarro: Hullo
[2017-01-10 20:02:13 UTC] aleandspirits: well, theres the dragon covenant
[2017-01-10 20:02:14 UTC] agoodlook: I hope a fan donates phil a TV to help him out. would be cool
[2017-01-10 20:02:15 UTC] bethe2670: yes i saw his goal of getting the PS4 PRO AND 4K TV
[2017-01-10 20:02:19 UTC] thermocrius: he tweeted "ew mins"
[2017-01-10 20:02:23 UTC] thermocrius: few mins*
[2017-01-10 20:02:27 UTC] lokizarro: You ready to get Blighted?
[2017-01-10 20:02:31 UTC] thermocrius: oh yes
[2017-01-10 20:02:35 UTC] agoodlook: yea bethe the goal is reasonable i hope he reaches it
[2017-01-10 20:02:36 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: Hope Phil plays Sniper Elite 4.. The ball shots will return
[2017-01-10 20:02:59 UTC] aleandspirits: id like it if phil went the proper way to blighttown, even if he has the back door open
[2017-01-10 20:03:01 UTC] obamalicksdee: Phil needs to save up 4 another stay cation
[2017-01-10 20:03:04 UTC] osithandrao: don't know why he needs a ps4 pro and 4k tv when he can't stream that resolution
[2017-01-10 20:03:05 UTC] yacherdy: I'm confused was there a goal for getting a new PC?
[2017-01-10 20:03:12 UTC] lokizarro: He is I believe @aleandspirits
[2017-01-10 20:03:21 UTC] aglet57: @Thermocrius Gonna be 15-30 minutes before the game if you're waiting.
[2017-01-10 20:03:25 UTC] agoodlook: well his tv is broken so he needs a new one anyways
[2017-01-10 20:03:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: there are 2 additional goals YaCherdy one for PS4 and 4k tv and one for a new PC
[2017-01-10 20:03:32 UTC] cnicks93: He got a new PC and a 4k tv and a ps4 pro?
[2017-01-10 20:03:40 UTC] thermocrius: yeah, I kno
[2017-01-10 20:03:43 UTC] cnicks93: oh there are goals
[2017-01-10 20:03:44 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no they're patreon goals Cnicks93
[2017-01-10 20:03:46 UTC] osithandrao: and most people don't even have 4k monitors to watch that resolution
[2017-01-10 20:03:46 UTC] theycallmejimbob: oh sorry
[2017-01-10 20:03:54 UTC] gergc5: its mass effect good game?
[2017-01-10 20:03:54 UTC] spookywun: he should just add a xbox slim for 4k testing aswell
[2017-01-10 20:04:02 UTC] n0turm0mmy: Phil doesn't really need Pro or 4K TV
[2017-01-10 20:04:02 UTC] aglet57: Woah, new goals? Sweet.
[2017-01-10 20:04:17 UTC] agoodlook: his tv is broken he needs new one
[2017-01-10 20:04:17 UTC] n0turm0mmy: And he could just use a cheap pc for streaming
[2017-01-10 20:04:20 UTC] cnicks93: oh ok patreon goals
[2017-01-10 20:04:23 UTC] n0turm0mmy: how is it broken?
[2017-01-10 20:04:34 UTC] agoodlook: it has dead pixels phil said
[2017-01-10 20:04:43 UTC] n0turm0mmy: So it is not broken, ok
[2017-01-10 20:04:49 UTC] aleandspirits: i wouldnt buy a 4k tv for $600
[2017-01-10 20:04:55 UTC] nothingnoone: osithandrao most people earn half as much as him for working 9-5 jobs
[2017-01-10 20:04:55 UTC] agoodlook: he'll probably talk about it on stream
[2017-01-10 20:04:57 UTC] aleandspirits: it'll probably be terrible
[2017-01-10 20:05:14 UTC] aglet57: Ok, nice to see some new goals. I get the PS4 Pro and the PC. Those are essential. But why is the TV a goal for patrons?
[2017-01-10 20:05:21 UTC] yacherdy: A good 4K TV goes for about 800-1200 dollars.
[2017-01-10 20:05:23 UTC] aleandspirits: there just arent proper 4k tvs for gaming yet, they all have inputlag
[2017-01-10 20:05:24 UTC] ziibrah: aleandspirits, exactly. many HDR TVs have horrible input lag
[2017-01-10 20:05:36 UTC] raptorbread: Shit I missed the last stream. Hey everyone!
[2017-01-10 20:05:40 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey raptorbread
[2017-01-10 20:05:41 UTC] cnicks93: the KS8000 has good input lag in HDR
[2017-01-10 20:05:44 UTC] aleandspirits: hi raptorbread
[2017-01-10 20:05:46 UTC] ziibrah: my samsung KS8005 is pretty good but it goes for around 1.2k
[2017-01-10 20:05:47 UTC] raptorbread: Someone wanna fill me in?
[2017-01-10 20:05:59 UTC] agoodlook: phil has new patreon goals raptor
[2017-01-10 20:05:59 UTC] osithandrao: those should be his own personal goals. Like him saving up money for them. Doing something extra on his side for those "Rewards"
[2017-01-10 20:06:01 UTC] popsicolo: That goal PogChamp
[2017-01-10 20:06:01 UTC] aleandspirits: he got a BKH lol
[2017-01-10 20:06:18 UTC] lokizarro: BKH is a solid weapon for a first game run and beyond.
[2017-01-10 20:06:18 UTC] osithandrao: how does anyone else but him benefit from him getting a ps4 pro and 4k tv?
[2017-01-10 20:06:21 UTC] bethe2670: i don't think Gino will be here today :(
[2017-01-10 20:06:31 UTC] lokizarro: It's KIND of a shame he got it and is gonna ditch the spear
[2017-01-10 20:06:31 UTC] aleandspirits: its a fun weapon thats what it is
[2017-01-10 20:06:34 UTC] yacherdy: I'm filling in for Gino
[2017-01-10 20:06:40 UTC] aglet57: Should be able to stream in 4K (where possible) without an actual 4K display.
[2017-01-10 20:06:41 UTC] cnicks93: I believe the LG OLED tv's got updates to decrease the input lag in HDR as well
[2017-01-10 20:06:42 UTC] lokizarro: Spear is great too but does take more work to get out its full potential
[2017-01-10 20:06:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: :( RIP the spear
[2017-01-10 20:07:01 UTC] aglet57: If the goals are new, I'm sure he'll go over them in pre.
[2017-01-10 20:07:02 UTC] lokizarro: We knew thee well.
[2017-01-10 20:07:05 UTC] n0_h3r0: Whats good chat
[2017-01-10 20:07:05 UTC] aleandspirits: he can literally take theBKH to the end of the game
[2017-01-10 20:07:09 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey N0_H3R0
[2017-01-10 20:07:12 UTC] agoodlook: what is the bonus of a PS4 pro?
[2017-01-10 20:07:12 UTC] lokizarro: Yeah, he can.
[2017-01-10 20:07:16 UTC] bethe2670: Gino has to be in hospital with his wife cause she was hit with a car :(
[2017-01-10 20:07:17 UTC] aleandspirits: what upgrades the BKH?
[2017-01-10 20:07:19 UTC] n0_h3r0: @theycallmejimbob, How you doing bro?
[2017-01-10 20:07:21 UTC] aleandspirits: is ittwinkling?

[2017-01-10 20:07:47 UTC] yacherdy: Thoughts go out to Gino and his wife
[2017-01-10 20:07:48 UTC] bethe2670: yeah
[2017-01-10 20:07:51 UTC] aleandspirits: fast roll BKH is so much fun
[2017-01-10 20:07:56 UTC] aglet57: prayers to them both
[2017-01-10 20:08:11 UTC] raptorbread: He can, but doesn't mean he'll A) no how to use it or B) Have the right build for it. And thoughts and prayers to Gino and his family
[2017-01-10 20:08:12 UTC] lokizarro: He should really get fast roll but he's still confused about rolling speeds
[2017-01-10 20:08:13 UTC] bethe2670: /me prays
[2017-01-10 20:08:20 UTC] gergc5: znort
[2017-01-10 20:08:22 UTC] aleandspirits: 25% of equipload
[2017-01-10 20:08:34 UTC] lokizarro: raptor, scaling on the BKH isn't great anyway, out of the box it's pretty beefy
[2017-01-10 20:08:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: gergc5, you're always testing Nightbot :P
[2017-01-10 20:08:44 UTC] lokizarro: But it loses its potential to other weapons that have greater potential with scaling etc.

[2017-01-10 20:09:17 UTC] lokizarro: Don't get mad at me for saying that though lol, it IS a solid weapon
[2017-01-10 20:09:24 UTC] lokizarro: Yeah, you do, totally random.
[2017-01-10 20:09:29 UTC] aleandspirits: like
[2017-01-10 20:09:34 UTC] aleandspirits: 1 chance at early game
[2017-01-10 20:09:40 UTC] raptorbread: Still, comes down to skill in the end. I heard he ditched blighttown yesterday
[2017-01-10 20:09:45 UTC] raptorbread: But he's gonna do it today
[2017-01-10 20:09:50 UTC] lokizarro: Speedrunners often favour the BKH
[2017-01-10 20:09:57 UTC] lokizarro: Yeah Raptor
[2017-01-10 20:10:01 UTC] aleandspirits: yeah, he actually found a really cool short-cut by himself
[2017-01-10 20:10:01 UTC] gergc5: dsp should play metal gear again
[2017-01-10 20:10:07 UTC] gergc5: R)
[2017-01-10 20:10:14 UTC] aleandspirits: he went down the elevator to valley of drakes
[2017-01-10 20:10:17 UTC] thermocrius: ye, by himself
[2017-01-10 20:10:20 UTC] aleandspirits: and went in the back way
[2017-01-10 20:10:22 UTC] lokizarro: I want to see him experience the full challenge of O&S, hoping the BKH doesn't overpower him
[2017-01-10 20:10:40 UTC] darksydephil: ok about tot start up the stream
[2017-01-10 20:10:43 UTC] lokizarro: If he doesn't upgrade it to at least +2, I imagine he's still in for a good challenge, and he needs to TWO hand to attack them
[2017-01-10 20:10:44 UTC] aglet57: What other Redemption Runs would people like to see? That's interesting.
[2017-01-10 20:10:44 UTC] thermocrius: the BKH deals about 300 damage without upgrades
[2017-01-10 20:10:51 UTC] supatune: speedrunners usually quit if they don't get that BKH drop and start over, it will definitely carry him through the game but I expect a few entertaining hiccups, Bed of Chaos should be fun
[2017-01-10 20:10:52 UTC] aleandspirits: Ornstein is super quick, it should challenge him a lot
[2017-01-10 20:10:57 UTC] raptorbread: Even with the right weapon, O&S are the main skill check for the game.
[2017-01-10 20:10:58 UTC] lokizarro: Yeah, not sure how resistant O&S are to it, not very I don't think
[2017-01-10 20:11:04 UTC] obamalicksdee: Go get um DPS
[2017-01-10 20:11:05 UTC] darksydephil: oh fuck, bed of chaos lol

[2017-01-10 20:11:26 UTC] gergc5: dsp tries it: Catherine on hard mode

[2017-01-10 20:12:56 UTC] osithandrao: with all the bits he's been donated this stream he should buy the DLC
[2017-01-10 20:13:01 UTC] lokizarro: He doesn't want to re-buy it for $15 he said.
[2017-01-10 20:13:04 UTC] raptorbread: RIP. That Artorias fight would have been fun to watch
[2017-01-10 20:13:04 UTC] thedoctor5437: he should do a redemption run of "AMY" it was a game that came out in 2012. I think it would be funny
[2017-01-10 20:13:07 UTC] aglet57: @clubsandwitchss I think it's still full price

[2017-01-10 20:13:19 UTC] osithandrao: It's only 15 bucks and he's been given more than that

[2017-01-10 20:13:26 UTC] lokizarro: I think he should do it now that he has BKH he should have more time to squeeze the DLC in before the new game releases.
[2017-01-10 20:13:27 UTC] clubsandwitchss: 15$ is too expensive for @DarksydePhil ?

[2017-01-10 20:13:30 UTC] diamond19800: what's Good @DarksydePhil
[2017-01-10 20:13:31 UTC] n0turm0mmy: DLC is too hard for Phil
[2017-01-10 20:13:33 UTC] lokizarro: On 360 apparently it is still full price at $15
[2017-01-10 20:13:36 UTC] clubsandwitchss: whaaat?
[2017-01-10 20:13:39 UTC] cnicks93: wow
[2017-01-10 20:13:44 UTC] aglet57: I suppose people could nominate it in a Patron's Choice?
[2017-01-10 20:13:46 UTC] gergc5: dsp didn't beat catherine legitimately, he needs to play the game again too
[2017-01-10 20:13:49 UTC] lokizarro: I dunno clubs lol, not sure if that's the full reasoning for it
[2017-01-10 20:13:50 UTC] raptorbread: If Phil gets to Gravelord Nito, by friday, I'll personally donate the 15 for the DLC
[2017-01-10 20:13:51 UTC] gergc5: R)
[2017-01-10 20:13:59 UTC] clubsandwitchss: clearly people enjoy dark souls streams look at the views
[2017-01-10 20:14:00 UTC] podusmonens: catherine was interesting
[2017-01-10 20:14:05 UTC] clubsandwitchss: but he wont drop 15$ on it?
[2017-01-10 20:14:06 UTC] cnicks93: i never played catherine, any good?
[2017-01-10 20:14:11 UTC] lokizarro: I know clubs, these streams have been really good for him.
[2017-01-10 20:14:17 UTC] clubsandwitchss: wtf
[2017-01-10 20:14:19 UTC] osithandrao: He'd spend your money on some bullshit raptor.
[2017-01-10 20:14:24 UTC] theycallmejimbob: is that even possible for him to reach before Friday raptorbread :P
[2017-01-10 20:14:24 UTC] n0_h3r0: @clubsandwitchss, Yeah I hope he changes his mind on that
[2017-01-10 20:14:38 UTC] obamalicksdee: Dark Souls+DPS+ Good Time
[2017-01-10 20:14:44 UTC] clubsandwitchss: Why would i donate bits if he wont spend 15$ on DLC for his highest viewed stream in months
[2017-01-10 20:14:47 UTC] podusmonens: people said a DS replay would be a disaster views-wise. WRONG! *trump voice
[2017-01-10 20:14:50 UTC] clubsandwitchss: jebus
[2017-01-10 20:14:51 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: @Cnicks93 Catherine was okay, in my opinion
[2017-01-10 20:14:59 UTC] raptorbread: It's totally possible
[2017-01-10 20:14:59 UTC] popsicolo: Catherine TriHard

[2017-01-10 20:15:10 UTC] n0_h3r0: Katherine RlyTho
[2017-01-10 20:15:23 UTC] cnicks93: @Tyler_The_Drawer I never heard or saw too much about it
[2017-01-10 20:15:25 UTC] podusmonens: haha no, jimmy, I think he just hates the game
[2017-01-10 20:15:31 UTC] popsicolo: Catherine reminds me of my life back in the summer.
[2017-01-10 20:15:33 UTC] bethe2670: cahman jimbob

[2017-01-10 20:15:49 UTC] n0_h3r0: CANT SEE
[2017-01-10 20:15:50 UTC] osithandrao: All you people on his forums should bring up him getting the DLc
[2017-01-10 20:15:51 UTC] raptorbread: Phil should really hold a PVP stream after he's done with DS1 again
[2017-01-10 20:15:55 UTC] n0_h3r0: Best dsp quote tbh
[2017-01-10 20:15:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bethe2670, didn't you say sonic heroes would be a better alternative cahman
[2017-01-10 20:15:59 UTC] podusmonens: stupid fucking game, look, im holding blovk
[2017-01-10 20:16:03 UTC] chaosalltheway: hope he'll go with lightning ascending of a spear
[2017-01-10 20:16:06 UTC] clubsandwitchss: Can chat agree not to hold @DarksydePhil hand today so no one gets mad?
[2017-01-10 20:16:10 UTC] popsicolo: Yep BeThe. They had a conflict of interest.
[2017-01-10 20:16:15 UTC] gaylordbutthump: oh hey raptor
[2017-01-10 20:16:16 UTC] gergc5: if he plays catherine again will be gold R)
[2017-01-10 20:16:21 UTC] raptorbread: Whats up!
[2017-01-10 20:16:36 UTC] thedoctor5437: popsicolo was the confict over who gets your dick?
[2017-01-10 20:16:37 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the definition of hand-holding the provision of careful support or guidance to someone during a learning process or a period of change.
[2017-01-10 20:16:42 UTC] podusmonens: I don't think phil even remembers catherine that well
[2017-01-10 20:16:44 UTC] neonbornspartan9: plays Catherine again what
[2017-01-10 20:16:46 UTC] popsicolo: Yes Doctor
[2017-01-10 20:16:50 UTC] supatune: I don't think he will make it down Blighttown via the Sewers, IIRC the frame rate is disgusting and the poison darts RIP, I bet he goes back to the shortcut and descends
[2017-01-10 20:16:55 UTC] n0turm0mmy: Phil can't help himself with looking at stream chat
[2017-01-10 20:16:56 UTC] tyler_the_drawer: @Cnicks93 No one really cared since it was a Japanese game from what I heard
[2017-01-10 20:16:59 UTC] yacherdy: Sounds like a Brazzers storyline
[2017-01-10 20:17:05 UTC] spyfoul: @clubsandwitchss that's like asking if obama will run for a 5th term. not likely
[2017-01-10 20:17:05 UTC] misterarcadia: @clubsandwitchss please! that would be awesome
[2017-01-10 20:17:09 UTC] n0_h3r0: !brazzers
[2017-01-10 20:17:13 UTC] n0_h3r0: :(
[2017-01-10 20:17:14 UTC] popsicolo: Just like one of my Japanese animes TriHard PogChamp
[2017-01-10 20:17:14 UTC] raptorbread: You don't miss out on anything too important via sewers
[2017-01-10 20:17:15 UTC] n0turm0mmy: And this chat can't help itself with the backseating
[2017-01-10 20:17:19 UTC] osithandrao: Nose FAQs
[2017-01-10 20:17:20 UTC] raptorbread: I think maybe the spidershield
[2017-01-10 20:17:25 UTC] raptorbread: I don't remember
[2017-01-10 20:17:27 UTC] aglet57: Handholding would be Phil stopping gameplay and asking the chat what to do. Not glancing at suggestions.
[2017-01-10 20:17:31 UTC] clubsandwitchss: I just think that unless @DarksydePhil asks chat what to do we should leave him alone and enjoy his redemption run

[2017-01-10 20:21:24 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Catherine on Nightmare difficulty phil TriHard
[2017-01-10 20:21:29 UTC] raptorbread: Phil I'll personally provide the 15 dollars if you play the DLC
[2017-01-10 20:21:32 UTC] darksydephil: im probably not going to have time for the dlc
[2017-01-10 20:21:34 UTC] lokizarro: With the solid virewership
[2017-01-10 20:21:35 UTC] gaylordbutthump: dlc is definitely worth playing
[2017-01-10 20:21:35 UTC] dinasaurking: I just recently played the DLC for dark souls 3, that was great
[2017-01-10 20:21:36 UTC] yacherdy: I really need to play all the Souls games. I'm just scared.
[2017-01-10 20:21:41 UTC] obamalicksdee: Make Time
[2017-01-10 20:21:42 UTC] darksydephil: i doubt ill even finish the vanilla game by the time RE7 releases at this rate lol
[2017-01-10 20:21:43 UTC] lokizarro: I thought that might be an issue with the new releases coming soon
[2017-01-10 20:21:44 UTC] humpiershaggy: Hey guys
[2017-01-10 20:21:48 UTC] darksydephil: im certainly not moving quickly through the game haha

[2017-01-10 20:21:52 UTC] aglet57: DLC backburner if anything. RE7 IS COMING
[2017-01-10 20:22:05 UTC] clubsandwitchss: @DarksydePhil Watch RE7 and other new games get half as many views, fuck new games TBH.
[2017-01-10 20:22:11 UTC] darksydephil: yeah
[2017-01-10 20:22:14 UTC] darksydephil: new games pay my bills
[2017-01-10 20:22:17 UTC] darksydephil: so you can stop with that nonsense
[2017-01-10 20:22:30 UTC] humpiershaggy: Cant wait for RE7
[2017-01-10 20:22:31 UTC] yacherdy: Going back to play old games all the time wouldn't be wise
[2017-01-10 20:22:36 UTC] clubsandwitchss: FF 15 got 300-400 viewers
[2017-01-10 20:22:37 UTC] chem_zegarra2018: Why do you guys only want Phil to rage? Let the man play new games.
[2017-01-10 20:22:40 UTC] clubsandwitchss: this gets twice that
[2017-01-10 20:22:46 UTC] goldencolts: only a sith deals in absolutes
[2017-01-10 20:22:48 UTC] n0turm0mmy: Focussing on new games is very short sighted
[2017-01-10 20:22:48 UTC] aglet57: I'd love a retro series to catch on, but who's to say if people would watch
[2017-01-10 20:22:49 UTC] gaylordbutthump: it's entertaining tho
[2017-01-10 20:22:49 UTC] gergc5: dsp playing fifa again :D
[2017-01-10 20:22:55 UTC] n0turm0mmy: Should rather play indy games
[2017-01-10 20:22:59 UTC] dinasaurking: Final fantasy always gets low views
[2017-01-10 20:23:02 UTC] gergc5: that was very fun to watch
[2017-01-10 20:23:02 UTC] darksydephil: viewers on twitch streams dont pay bills
[2017-01-10 20:23:06 UTC] darksydephil: youtube views, subs and cheers do
[2017-01-10 20:23:12 UTC] darksydephil: this is basic knowledge
[2017-01-10 20:23:17 UTC] yacherdy: Dark Souls is an exception.
[2017-01-10 20:23:40 UTC] humpiershaggy: Happy to be of help, ol' boy
[2017-01-10 20:23:51 UTC] lokizarro: It's your call, I think the viewership here will be better than RE7 for you if I'm being totally honest, but I'd like to see RE7 too so win win for me.
[2017-01-10 20:23:57 UTC] realpetchicken: screw the haters
[2017-01-10 20:23:59 UTC] yacherdy: If he went back and played Brink I don't think people would care.
[2017-01-10 20:24:02 UTC] chem_zegarra2018: No. all you guys only want Phil to play the DLC, then make a 4 hour long video saying how bad he is at games. Everyone sucks at games
[2017-01-10 20:24:06 UTC] aglet57: RE7 should be hype
[2017-01-10 20:24:13 UTC] lokizarro: I just wanna see you get to a particular boss in Dark Souls base game lol
[2017-01-10 20:24:16 UTC] ukyo9: Man, lately the haters have been even worse than usual
[2017-01-10 20:24:21 UTC] clubsandwitchss: @DarksydePhil 800 viewers, more bits and subs than FFXV but you wont commit to finishing the redemption run? Or do the DLC? unfortunate...
[2017-01-10 20:24:25 UTC] stalkerstein: i agree with sandwich but can understand what phil means
[2017-01-10 20:24:31 UTC] podusmonens: how so, ukyo?

[2017-01-10 20:25:05 UTC] ukaaay: hope you're feeling better Phil!
[2017-01-10 20:25:08 UTC] thedoctor5437: this was said about homefront and no mans sky, and mafia 3 and a buch of other games that was disappointing, so fingers crossed RE7 actually turns out good
[2017-01-10 20:25:09 UTC] popsicolo: Well, time to go get test results. I'll see you around. I'll probably be back later.
[2017-01-10 20:25:18 UTC] suckasurprise: @DarksydePhil Hey Phil, those old pics of you at the Chinatown Fair arcade that you tweeted out a week or 2 ago were awesome
[2017-01-10 20:25:20 UTC] obamalicksdee: Phil also needs to replay Bloodborne dlc

You gave the man 300 dollars for doing nothing special. You are part of the reason why he's going to fail one day on YT. When you enable stagnation, you are enabling his inevitable failure on YT because he won't change his shitty attitude.
[2017-01-10 22:54:11 UTC] tulliuscicero25: you seem to be our resident expert
[2017-01-10 22:54:16 UTC] overtonesoflevi: Phil should get the Wolf ring if he's gonna wear that

[2017-01-10 22:55:14 UTC] ukyo9: Phil, the whole roll as I-frames in dark souls 1. The reason why they are still hitting you is because that attack has a persistent hitbox (let's call it a shockwave)
[2017-01-10 22:55:14 UTC] overtonesoflevi: But in DS1 the wolf ring is one of the best rings imo
[2017-01-10 22:55:17 UTC] mrbiggles6789: i bought some of Leannas soap and it burnt my skin :(
