[2017-01-12 19:54:22 UTC] blue_blur64: Well it doesn't really matter bethe, since the PS4 likes to block any possible copyrighted music. I was attempting to stream Project DIva Future Tone but all the music gets blocked
[2017-01-12 19:54:39 UTC] blue_blur64: And the Tritton headset was a gift because the default ones were also shit
[2017-01-12 19:54:50 UTC] dankedan: Oh lol

[2017-01-12 20:08:28 UTC] theycallmejimbob: although more than half of the deaths were due to beginners traps and slippery branches so shouldn't count
[2017-01-12 20:08:32 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i really wonder how long anor londo is gonna take
[2017-01-12 20:08:38 UTC] aglet57: nothing much. how are you guys?

[2017-01-12 20:09:49 UTC] raptorbread: We're close to a midway point
[2017-01-12 20:09:55 UTC] podusmonens: pewdipie said he will quit youtube when he reaches 50 million subs. he's at 52 now and still going. why do these shitheads run their mouths like this?
[2017-01-12 20:09:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: someone said yesterday he was around half way through it AGLET57
[2017-01-12 20:09:55 UTC] blue_blur64: Now that they cancelled Scalebound, yes @jackwhite2000

[2017-01-12 20:10:19 UTC] theycallmejimbob: podusmonens, it's kinda like all the celebrities who said they'd leave the USA if Trump won :D
[2017-01-12 20:10:25 UTC] blue_blur64: No @podusmonens , he said that he would close his channel and he did. Never said which one
[2017-01-12 20:10:26 UTC] raptorbread: Cuphead is coming out soon though
[2017-01-12 20:10:26 UTC] podusmonens: yep
[2017-01-12 20:10:38 UTC] podusmonens: oh god blue
[2017-01-12 20:10:38 UTC] jackwhite2000: only xbox exclusive that looks good is crackdown 3
[2017-01-12 20:10:45 UTC] podusmonens: that's such a cop out :D
[2017-01-12 20:10:53 UTC] raptorbread: Wasn't crackdown 2 garbage?
[2017-01-12 20:10:56 UTC] aglet57: Nintendo announcement is tonight, yes?
[2017-01-12 20:10:59 UTC] encelor: crackdown looks bit outdated imo
[2017-01-12 20:11:05 UTC] blue_blur64: Well that was his prank :P
[2017-01-12 20:11:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: is crackdown 3 gonna be released on Windows too?
[2017-01-12 20:11:07 UTC] encelor: crackdown 3 i mean

[2017-01-12 20:11:28 UTC] raptorbread: Anyone get it?
[2017-01-12 20:11:31 UTC] podusmonens: pc gaming is the future, sell all your puny consoles
[2017-01-12 20:11:36 UTC] jackwhite2000: halo wars 2 another halo sea of thieves looks boring state of decay 2 another zombie game cuphead looks decent
[2017-01-12 20:11:45 UTC] blue_blur64: And yes @AGLET57 it is tonight
[2017-01-12 20:11:48 UTC] jackwhite2000: @theycallmejimbob yes

[2017-01-12 20:11:54 UTC] raptorbread: Cupheaad loos so good
[2017-01-12 20:11:54 UTC] theycallmejimbob: the switch is the future B) dragin
[2017-01-12 20:12:00 UTC] encelor: @theycallmejimbob so far its xbox one only
[2017-01-12 20:12:02 UTC] gaylordbutthump: nah i don't have much interest in KH
[2017-01-12 20:12:03 UTC] podusmonens: yeah right :D
[2017-01-12 20:12:03 UTC] encelor: might change
[2017-01-12 20:12:06 UTC] blue_blur64: Why do you think that?
[2017-01-12 20:12:08 UTC] aglet57: I'm hyped about the Switch, honestly.
[2017-01-12 20:12:12 UTC] raptorbread: I literally bough a WiiU for smash
[2017-01-12 20:12:13 UTC] podusmonens: it's just another gimmick
[2017-01-12 20:12:19 UTC] jackwhite2000: xbox is not looking good when it comes to exclusives
[2017-01-12 20:12:22 UTC] blue_blur64: So? It's not forced on anybody
[2017-01-12 20:12:23 UTC] gaylordbutthump: oh yeah, i hope they announce a new metroid for the switch
[2017-01-12 20:12:25 UTC] rneophyte: is he having another vote with minecraft as a possible game. I came back right as that screen passed and I'm too impatient to wait lol
[2017-01-12 20:12:42 UTC] raptorbread: Hopefully its an actual metroid and not federation force 2
[2017-01-12 20:12:53 UTC] podusmonens: I know, I'm just saying it's not a smart investment
[2017-01-12 20:12:53 UTC] aglet57: I don't have any money, so I'm going to have to save up to get it and some games at launch
[2017-01-12 20:13:00 UTC] gaylordbutthump: yeah, i don't know what nintendo was thinking with FF
[2017-01-12 20:13:03 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yeah for the patreons choice rneophyte anyone who donates 5 bucks get to choose between persona 4, yakuza 0 and minecraft
[2017-01-12 20:13:09 UTC] blue_blur64: So funny story. People were lined up in front of NYC's Nintendo store hoping to preorder the Switch. They didn't realize that preorders don't start until tomorrow LUL
[2017-01-12 20:13:15 UTC] podusmonens: people actually thunk they are going to play the switch mobile, on airplane? that battery will last an hour tops
[2017-01-12 20:13:22 UTC] aglet57: LOL
[2017-01-12 20:13:28 UTC] podusmonens: the fuck are you thinkin
[2017-01-12 20:13:29 UTC] encelor: @AGLET57 i wouldn't get at launch then tbh wait for gameplay and early reviews
[2017-01-12 20:13:29 UTC] blue_blur64: It says 3-5 @podusmonens
[2017-01-12 20:13:41 UTC] raptorbread: The 3ds battery is already complete garbage
[2017-01-12 20:13:50 UTC] aglet57: @encelor I think it depends on games. I love Mario, so that's going to launch
[2017-01-12 20:14:09 UTC] raptorbread: The galaxy series was actually really refreshing.
[2017-01-12 20:14:19 UTC] encelor: @AGLET57 just saying on tight budget you don't want to end up with a no mans sky
[2017-01-12 20:14:19 UTC] blue_blur64: I mean, I'm going to get the Switch as a graduation gift, so it's not like I'm losing anything
[2017-01-12 20:14:32 UTC] aglet57: Galaxy was so good. Especially after the shit that was Sunshine. sorry
[2017-01-12 20:14:34 UTC] raptorbread: When's the actual release date?
[2017-01-12 20:14:36 UTC] rneophyte: the switch might be my birthday present
[2017-01-12 20:14:38 UTC] neonbornspartan9: cmon,dark souls again. I'm so sick of all the trolls watching this stream.
[2017-01-12 20:14:45 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i'll probably wait a few months to hear whether the games are good or not. battery isn't really a concern because i'll only play on the tv
[2017-01-12 20:14:46 UTC] blue_blur64: Well latest rumors say March 17th
[2017-01-12 20:14:54 UTC] aglet57: @encelor Good point! I'm going to put away a dollar a day for a bit and see how I do.
[2017-01-12 20:14:54 UTC] theycallmejimbob: St Patricks day :D
[2017-01-12 20:15:05 UTC] raptorbread: Never buy a console at launch
[2017-01-12 20:15:06 UTC] darksydephil: ok
[2017-01-12 20:15:09 UTC] darksydephil: stream working for all?
[2017-01-12 20:15:09 UTC] blue_blur64: But we'll get everything confirmed tonight, so just wait to form an opinion then
[2017-01-12 20:15:11 UTC] darksydephil: if so ill tweet we're live
[2017-01-12 20:15:16 UTC] blue_blur64: Yeah, just no noise :P
[2017-01-12 20:15:18 UTC] gaylordbutthump: yeah it's working
[2017-01-12 20:15:18 UTC] theycallmejimbob: yeah Phil

[2017-01-12 21:31:06 UTC] kevin2686: the armor set gives great poison resistance
[2017-01-12 21:31:11 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: phil is saying he plays on the 360 because he have problems with his ps3 hdmi or something
[2017-01-12 21:31:14 UTC] thermocrius: though it is still a console game, obviously

[2017-01-12 21:31:28 UTC] ukyo9: hey @flammeberge , this is DSP replaying dark souls since the first time he got helped by summons and he wants to do it "legit"

[2017-01-12 21:33:13 UTC] christoph5782: @kuroriku The combat design is designed around a controller as well as the massive text. Whilst you could play it with a controller on PC, it was not designed around it.
[2017-01-12 21:33:14 UTC] xspheerx: That's demon souls wasn't it lol
[2017-01-12 21:33:14 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I need to watch it then

[2017-01-12 21:33:40 UTC] chihuahuagod: First run?
[2017-01-12 21:33:47 UTC] kg1772: he should play demon souls next but without the item duplicate glitch

[2017-01-12 21:33:51 UTC] gaylordbutthump: third run
[2017-01-12 21:33:52 UTC] raptorbread: I just prefer consoles. Dont really care too much about framerate or graphics
[2017-01-12 21:33:52 UTC] kuroriku: @Christoph5782 just cause its on a PC doesnt mean KB and mouse are standard. if you wanna talk control schemes thats a diff convo all together.
[2017-01-12 21:33:58 UTC] retrocerberus: in a weird twilight zone way, yeah, kinda first run
[2017-01-12 21:34:03 UTC] retrocerberus: but no
[2017-01-12 21:34:06 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Dark Souls was not made for mouse and keyboard even on PC
[2017-01-12 21:34:06 UTC] bobbi_ling: shes only a boss if you arttack her
[2017-01-12 21:34:13 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Much better with a controller

[2017-01-12 21:34:19 UTC] hoeboe777: Lmao
[2017-01-12 21:34:20 UTC] khawaja7: funnily i beat DkS1 and NG+ with M+KB after that i shifted to using Gamepads
[2017-01-12 21:34:24 UTC] brightsydebob: kb and mouse are better inputs then a controller
[2017-01-12 21:34:24 UTC] chihuahuagod: @gaylordbutthump Alright thanks a lot. He's never been on the painted world though has he? :D

[2017-01-12 23:23:15 UTC] akioartorius: so the chat wants to talk about waifus? so no a laifus...
[2017-01-12 23:23:16 UTC] zombiehoax: @TrigunRK Agreed, although I usually go for the key. Maybe it makes me cheap to get early estus boosts but it sure helps my death counter stay low
[2017-01-12 23:23:21 UTC] knightmare_29: Ds3 has some hard bosses though
[2017-01-12 23:23:21 UTC] emnay_i_say: It was reasonably easy.
