[2017-01-20 20:04:49 UTC] taurusoxford: spade, the only way Phil will ever beat the bloodborne dlc is if he starts the game over
[2017-01-20 20:04:54 UTC] theycallmejimbob: his save got corrupted iirc spade137
[2017-01-20 20:05:00 UTC] darksydephil: ive already said a million times it wont happen

[2017-01-20 20:07:49 UTC] gosoxtim: sorry bethe :
[2017-01-20 20:07:53 UTC] darksydephil: i dont think theres any way to prevent being "hosted" on twitch
[2017-01-20 20:07:54 UTC] bethe2670: phil its live btw
[2017-01-20 20:08:05 UTC] darksydephil: every day when i turn on my stream i get notifications in chat that people are hosting me
[2017-01-20 20:08:11 UTC] bethe2670: jimbob i am not lol
[2017-01-20 20:08:12 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: isn't that just something you owuld like though?
[2017-01-20 20:08:14 UTC] darksydephil: but i see no way to prevent that
[2017-01-20 20:08:18 UTC] rc_2: no but you can disable the names of the hosted channel being shown
[2017-01-20 20:08:23 UTC] xerath_san: lets do this
[2017-01-20 20:08:26 UTC] mfd4419: Why are people doing that
[2017-01-20 20:08:34 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: more people watching don't seem like a problem though phil?
[2017-01-20 20:08:35 UTC] blue_blur64: Well it brings viewers from that channel to yours
[2017-01-20 20:08:36 UTC] shotinthedeep: What is "hosting"?
[2017-01-20 20:08:41 UTC] darksydephil: no? i know a few of them are detractors who watch the stream on their pages so they can have their own toxic chats. and they all have adblock enabled regardless, so i get nothing out of it
[2017-01-20 20:08:45 UTC] nerv117: cheer100 Zelda Hype dspSexy
[2017-01-20 20:08:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: you broadcast Phil's channel on your own channel shotinthedeep
[2017-01-20 20:08:59 UTC] darksydephil: no bits, no subs, no ad revenue. its basically theft. i dunno why twitch allows it
[2017-01-20 20:09:02 UTC] taurusoxford: @shotinthedeep hosting is someone streaming Phil's stream through their twitch channel
[2017-01-20 20:09:03 UTC] pwnage_101: @darksydephil Hey Phil, how are you doing?
[2017-01-20 20:09:11 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Phil, you should email twitch if they'll respond. They could try something.
[2017-01-20 20:09:38 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: better that they have their own toxic chat then bring it in here i would say though.
[2017-01-20 20:09:38 UTC] shotinthedeep: oh ok thanks jimbob and TaurusOxford
[2017-01-20 20:09:41 UTC] darksydephil: i know some people are legit, for example theres a new feature to auto-host random channels and thats how a bunch of people host me
[2017-01-20 20:09:51 UTC] darksydephil: but i recognize 2 names specifically
[2017-01-20 20:10:06 UTC] neonbornspartan9: oh ok
[2017-01-20 20:10:19 UTC] darksydephil: people should NOT be hosting if the streamer doesn't benefit. thats just stupid. like having my YT videos play on someone else's channel lol
[2017-01-20 20:10:28 UTC] blue_blur64: Well those examples I would contact twitch about, since they're not supposed to be showing the hosted stream the entire time (I think)
[2017-01-20 20:10:34 UTC] bethe2670: probably tevin and liquid
[2017-01-20 20:10:39 UTC] xerath_san: i thought adblock dosnt work on twitch anymore
[2017-01-20 20:10:43 UTC] pwnage_101: So is the Twitch Chill Stream still happening on Sunday?
[2017-01-20 20:10:52 UTC] darksydephil: it doesn't matter that adblock doesn't work, ads make no money here.
[2017-01-20 20:11:17 UTC] darksydephil: its about the subs and bits. if these guys are hosting my stream just to shit on it, they shouldn't be allowed to host at all since ill never potentially make anything off of it
[2017-01-20 20:11:42 UTC] darksydephil: its exactly the same as ripping my video illegally from YT to make a ***
[2017-01-20 20:11:43 UTC] spade137: but tevin subbed to you Kappa
[2017-01-20 20:11:43 UTC] blue_blur64: I can check the TOS to see if it says anything about hosting rules

[2017-01-20 20:12:04 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey Sootiestgameo
[2017-01-20 20:12:05 UTC] darksydephil: anyway, its not a huge deal but i just find it really weird that twitch supports this. but not surprised
[2017-01-20 20:12:09 UTC] dukesdearfreja: Hey @darksydephil and chat
[2017-01-20 20:12:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: well the thing is, no one gets any notification other than you unless you acknowledge it. And I don't see there be any difference if they are watching you directly or through a 3rd party on twitch. Or Am i not seing something here??
[2017-01-20 20:12:09 UTC] darksydephil: they do a lot of things ass backwards
[2017-01-20 20:12:17 UTC] sootiestgameo: hows it going today? @theycallmejimbob

[2017-01-20 20:12:57 UTC] dukesdearfreja: All is on
[2017-01-20 20:13:01 UTC] neonbornspartan9: the fact they have their own chat, saying toxic things, and they're not getting banned for it and defaming phil is fucked up.
[2017-01-20 20:13:12 UTC] darksydephil: I am doing a Ni-Oh playtrhough. i announced this in my big schedule update a few weeks back
[2017-01-20 20:13:13 UTC] marcusdoesgaming: hope people vote yakuza 4
[2017-01-20 20:13:15 UTC] shotinthedeep: vidar if they watch it from a third party Phil can't get ad revenue or bits from it

[2017-01-20 20:13:40 UTC] darksydephil: lol
[2017-01-20 20:13:49 UTC] darksydephil: anyway, ok good, let me tweet that we're live
[2017-01-20 20:14:03 UTC] sootiestgameo: i was thinking of getting guilty gear revelator 2 when it comes out

[2017-01-20 21:44:22 UTC] kinggreen: @thedoctor5437, 1 timeline is when Link loses, another one is the timeline where Ganon is sealed, the last one is the timeline where he is a kid again

[2017-01-20 22:42:33 UTC] megamannt125: I don't agree with rioting either but it's understandable that it happens as a result of no one listening
[2017-01-20 22:42:38 UTC] encelor: @Slurmdrinker pretty sure squire enix have nothing to do with FFBE since Gumi made the ariana grande promotion happen

[2017-01-20 22:44:38 UTC] indicansent: @Megamannt125 A lot of people don't seem to understand that, but there's truth to it. You can understand why something happens and not personally agree with it at the same time. But the rioters who show up should understand they're undermining whatever message the peaceful protesters want to put out there.
