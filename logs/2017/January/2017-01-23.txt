[2017-01-23 20:13:26 UTC] darksydephil: just refreshed the capture software as it looks like it crashed
[2017-01-23 20:13:28 UTC] bethe2670: yes philliper

[2017-01-23 20:15:12 UTC] insomniaticmeat: i wouldn't want to play it vr first time around..
[2017-01-23 20:15:13 UTC] shotinthedeep: Unless he has some east coast time zone still
[2017-01-23 20:15:15 UTC] fensthespook: But yeah..I was hoping he'd do it in VR :P
[2017-01-23 20:15:21 UTC] bethe2670: deep who says he is playing it for 3 hours at 9pm

[2017-01-23 20:15:44 UTC] kingjadvcmp: this'll sound like a dumb question but is it the same game whether you play with VR or not? Or is there a seperate mode for VR and normal lol
[2017-01-23 20:15:47 UTC] bethe2670: RESIDENT EVIL 7 HYPE
[2017-01-23 20:15:52 UTC] shotinthedeep: I'm saying that if it's a midnight release then it wouldn't be unlocked at 9pm

[2017-01-23 20:17:09 UTC] bethe2670: its the truth though kingjad
[2017-01-23 20:17:13 UTC] rbreezay: Do you think adding the stream chat along with the face cam for RE7 would be to much? I'm sure you could do a clear background for the chat.
[2017-01-23 20:17:13 UTC] masterswielder: Fuck IGN
[2017-01-23 20:17:14 UTC] jackwhite2000: @bethe2670 yesterday you werent excited for it at all what changed your mind so quickly?
[2017-01-23 20:17:17 UTC] kinggreen: I missed the last OoT. Good thing I watched the vids.
[2017-01-23 20:17:18 UTC] bobbi_ling: dont compare re remake with such trash plz beth
[2017-01-23 20:17:24 UTC] fensthespook: Phil does great horror LPs. His Fatal Frame 5 series was one of my favorites
[2017-01-23 20:17:24 UTC] bethe2670: jack i just said it
[2017-01-23 20:17:26 UTC] kingjadvcmp: IGN still gave it a relatively decent score, wasn't it 7.7 or something?
[2017-01-23 20:17:33 UTC] alukart177: Phil, are you checking out the overwatch year of the rooster update tomorrow of at a later date?
[2017-01-23 20:17:36 UTC] darksydephil: RE7 is the same in VR, except hte field of view is drastically reduced bc of the PSVR's limitations. basically you're making the game harder bc it's harder to see anything
[2017-01-23 20:17:38 UTC] vendatus: 7.7 is still good LUL
[2017-01-23 20:17:38 UTC] rbreezay: IGN Is sketch
[2017-01-23 20:17:42 UTC] masterswielder: My friend got a copy early and he's been loving RE 7

[2017-01-23 20:18:06 UTC] drilbit777: Re 7 looks boring tbh
[2017-01-23 20:18:16 UTC] rbreezay: Getting the game for Xbox One. Read that the PS4 is better
[2017-01-23 20:18:19 UTC] drilbit777: It's more Texas chainsaw massacre the game than resident evil lol
[2017-01-23 20:18:21 UTC] bethe2670: jack i saw some of the early boss fights and they were epic as fuck
[2017-01-23 20:18:21 UTC] clubsbabyseals: @DarksydePhil You should do PS VR post game in RE7 otherwise sell your PS VR I guess?
[2017-01-23 20:18:26 UTC] mrvaguetv: 7.7 is not good if they gave RE6 a 7.9 lol
[2017-01-23 20:18:29 UTC] bethe2670: this music is LOUD as fuck

[2017-01-23 20:18:55 UTC] jackwhite2000: dont want no spoilers
[2017-01-23 20:19:00 UTC] kingjadvcmp: personally, I'd prefer seeing a VR perspective compared to a 'normal' view, but that's just me. I know there's split opinions
[2017-01-23 20:19:03 UTC] rbreezay: No spoilers
[2017-01-23 20:19:07 UTC] bethe2670: everyone says resi 7 is the best since resi 4
[2017-01-23 20:19:16 UTC] bethe2670: and it might be
[2017-01-23 20:19:16 UTC] drilbit777: Spoilers RE7 has zombies

[2017-01-23 20:19:55 UTC] bobbi_ling: to this godly music gino
[2017-01-23 20:20:00 UTC] vendatus: Ready for Phil to beat RE7 in 4 hours for a trophy and not use more than 3 healing items for another SeemsGood
[2017-01-23 20:20:02 UTC] beawesomeone: Quick question Phil, if you are in need of so much money and close to being broke... why did you bought Nintendo Switch?
[2017-01-23 20:20:09 UTC] bethe2670: all i know is you are in a house with like 4 psychos looking for your wife
[2017-01-23 20:20:18 UTC] bethe2670: and that was not spoilers

[2017-01-23 20:20:27 UTC] bethe2670: thats what it says on the bio
[2017-01-23 20:20:43 UTC] drilbit777: @rbreezay Far from it actually lol I'm just not a fan of first person horror games and re7 looks far from what an re game should be
[2017-01-23 20:20:44 UTC] kingjadvcmp: how much was the switch again in the US? It's like £300+ over here
[2017-01-23 20:20:44 UTC] bobbi_ling: steve has a wife? PogChamp
[2017-01-23 20:20:56 UTC] clubsbabyseals: @DarksydePhil if you don't use the PS VR do you consider it a waste of money?
[2017-01-23 20:20:57 UTC] salv88: bethe if you watched TCM you've seen RE7 lol

[2017-01-23 20:21:57 UTC] fensthespook: Since you've played them all are you more of an RE fan than a Silent Hills fan?
[2017-01-23 20:22:03 UTC] jonthemon94: phil how do you rate oot
[2017-01-23 20:22:10 UTC] lvlpower: at less you can play the classic Nintendo games on the switch
[2017-01-23 20:22:12 UTC] kingjadvcmp: Phil are you saying the money you've made from vids has paid for the purchase of it? Or are you talking from entertainment perspective? Interesting turn of phrase, 'money's worth'
[2017-01-23 20:22:15 UTC] ginosaji48: 11/10
[2017-01-23 20:22:26 UTC] darksydephil: probably both at this point
[2017-01-23 20:22:31 UTC] darksydephil: i put out a shitload of vids on the psvr

[2017-01-23 20:23:11 UTC] bobbi_ling: nioh gonna make gaming great again
[2017-01-23 20:23:14 UTC] lvlpower: question is how much Nintendo is going to charge for the classic games
[2017-01-23 20:23:16 UTC] bethe2670: pfft
[2017-01-23 20:23:21 UTC] faesrolls: man these images sure are a cringefest. fucking cuckold fanboys lmao

[2017-01-23 20:23:22 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I saw some nioh gameplay earlier, it looks like a quite interesting combat system. Requires great timing and strategy
[2017-01-23 20:23:24 UTC] vendatus: The Nioh demo ended today I think BabyRage
[2017-01-23 20:23:31 UTC] drilbit777: @lvlpower probably the same as Wii U

[2017-01-23 22:13:48 UTC] yacherdy: Holy shit the default mouse sensitivity in Mass Effect 2 is out of control.
[2017-01-23 22:13:56 UTC] shotinthedeep: re7 release is way more important than some overwatch event
[2017-01-23 22:13:56 UTC] yacherdy: Overwatch > Resident Evil 7

[2017-01-23 22:19:11 UTC] popsicolo: The guy that make a remix of Phil saying "BOONE" made a new remix after several years just the other day.
[2017-01-23 22:19:11 UTC] encelor: :D
[2017-01-23 22:19:17 UTC] retrocerberus: his GTAV pt is all messed up

[2017-01-23 22:21:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Mafia 2 was pretty good too
[2017-01-23 22:21:19 UTC] encelor: i think someone archieved that video of phills axe shower gel review
[2017-01-23 22:21:24 UTC] bobbi_ling: phil was mlg at it gino
[2017-01-23 22:21:29 UTC] popsicolo: Phil is very close with his audience. How many other youtubers have you seen take a shower... and other things.
[2017-01-23 22:21:29 UTC] ginosaji48: mafia 2 could be WAAAAAY better
[2017-01-23 22:21:36 UTC] yacherdy: other good PTs were Fallout 3, ME1, ME3, Alan Wake....basically any good games
[2017-01-23 22:21:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I thought Forza Horizon 3 was funny too in parts :D

[2017-01-23 22:22:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bobbi's suggestion is better
[2017-01-23 22:22:22 UTC] theycallmejimbob: doodly
[2017-01-23 22:22:23 UTC] ginosaji48: the fap emote was denied because of the look or name ?
[2017-01-23 22:22:31 UTC] popsicolo: Yes.
[2017-01-23 22:22:32 UTC] shotinthedeep: i think the name
[2017-01-23 22:22:36 UTC] yacherdy: YOU ARE FAKE BEWBS

[2017-01-23 22:22:38 UTC] bobbi_ling: look
[2017-01-23 22:22:42 UTC] kinggoken: lol he was actually going to have that as an emote?
[2017-01-23 22:22:47 UTC] bethe2670: pops it could be like the wow duude or the nothing i could do
[2017-01-23 22:22:49 UTC] bobbi_ling: no orgasms allowed

[2017-01-23 22:23:05 UTC] popsicolo: Hear me roar Kreygasm
[2017-01-23 22:23:11 UTC] ginosaji48: Kreygasm also looks like orgasm emote

[2017-01-23 22:23:25 UTC] bobbi_ling: rawr XD i sound emo
[2017-01-23 22:23:37 UTC] ginosaji48: so i dont see a problem with phil's face
[2017-01-23 22:24:04 UTC] yacherdy: Yeah is Kreygasm actually a photo of someone about to cum?
[2017-01-23 22:24:07 UTC] ginosaji48: maybe they thought two would be too much
[2017-01-23 22:24:08 UTC] yacherdy: but* is*
[2017-01-23 22:24:08 UTC] theycallmejimbob: there's nadedFap,blindFap and maiFap subscriber emotes on twitch.Maybe it was the face :(
[2017-01-23 22:24:37 UTC] encelor: @theycallmejimbob or the fact he actually fapped
[2017-01-23 22:24:42 UTC] encelor: and twitch knows
[2017-01-23 22:24:57 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he was scratching his leg encelor Twitch have one track minds
[2017-01-23 22:25:14 UTC] encelor: Scratching his leg TriHard
[2017-01-23 22:25:23 UTC] spade137: Kappa sure he was
[2017-01-23 22:25:23 UTC] yacherdy: I may have to try this "scratching my leg" thing out.
[2017-01-23 22:25:39 UTC] encelor: man did enjoy scratching his leg Kreygasm
[2017-01-23 22:25:55 UTC] ginosaji48: there was one girl on twitch too, she masturbated on cam, and now she has a video on pornhub
[2017-01-23 22:26:02 UTC] kinggoken: lol
[2017-01-23 22:26:03 UTC] shotinthedeep: that was the nioh alpha demo prestream i think
[2017-01-23 22:26:05 UTC] yacherdy: I'm gonna go make Oriental Top Ramen (because its the best). Fight me.
[2017-01-23 22:26:06 UTC] spade137: name please
[2017-01-23 22:26:24 UTC] encelor: rice spagethi with broth?
[2017-01-23 22:26:27 UTC] bobbi_ling: ramen breath Kreygasm
[2017-01-23 22:26:28 UTC] encelor: sounds good
[2017-01-23 22:26:28 UTC] yacherdy: @Ginosaji48 I'm pretty sure she was a cam model too though
[2017-01-23 22:26:36 UTC] theycallmejimbob: uhhh incognito mode here I come
[2017-01-23 22:26:48 UTC] yacherdy: @Bobbi_Ling It's the best!
[2017-01-23 22:26:53 UTC] lemonplaysgames: There's no difference in what Phil wanted to use the emote for. Whether Phil actually did it or not, the face still represents sexual pleasure, just like kreygasm and the others.
[2017-01-23 22:26:55 UTC] freddytopkek: 20 min now ?
[2017-01-23 22:26:57 UTC] yacherdy: @Ginosaji48 Not that I would know.
[2017-01-23 22:26:59 UTC] freddytopkek: Or how lomng ?
[2017-01-23 22:27:12 UTC] kinggoken: this is a long break
[2017-01-23 22:27:13 UTC] ginosaji48: search for Nova Patra and you'll find her
[2017-01-23 22:27:15 UTC] neonbornspartan9: WOAW, I just watched multiple gameplay vids of Zelda BOTW and it looked great man; the environment/open world, hunting/collecting, and combat look great.
[2017-01-23 22:27:19 UTC] yacherdy: Only thing is that girl showed extreme nudity on that stream
[2017-01-23 22:27:19 UTC] encelor: there is a difference in a meme and actual fap
[2017-01-23 22:27:42 UTC] bobbi_ling: dspCowboy
[2017-01-23 22:27:46 UTC] yacherdy: It's not like we saw Phil's mushroom tip
[2017-01-23 22:27:46 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @encelor, Read what I said again, the intent is still there.
[2017-01-23 22:27:49 UTC] shotinthedeep: escanor then why did kreygasm get approved and Phils not?
[2017-01-23 22:27:54 UTC] lemonplaysgames: There's absolutely no denying that fact.
[2017-01-23 22:27:54 UTC] vsevolodeliseev: still that emote would be kinda inappropriate
[2017-01-23 22:28:05 UTC] yacherdy: Thank god Phil's not a shooter.
[2017-01-23 22:28:14 UTC] bobbi_ling: ...
[2017-01-23 22:28:15 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Because DSP has a negative stigma revolving around him, why else?
[2017-01-23 22:28:17 UTC] cordesdeboistvlive: where is he?
[2017-01-23 22:28:23 UTC] yacherdy: Sorry.
[2017-01-23 22:28:24 UTC] ginosaji48: break
[2017-01-23 22:28:31 UTC] encelor: well kreygasm is done as a joke

[2017-01-23 22:28:48 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Joke or not, if Twitch think it's inappropriate, why did they approve them?
[2017-01-23 22:28:50 UTC] encelor: Kreygasm
[2017-01-23 22:29:02 UTC] encelor: because its not breaking rules
[2017-01-23 22:29:09 UTC] lemonplaysgames: You can't back peddle on that, those are double standards.
[2017-01-23 22:29:09 UTC] encelor: for joke doing face
[2017-01-23 22:29:12 UTC] iconicmaster1: people are already streaming re7

[2017-01-23 22:29:29 UTC] lemonplaysgames: That's all I'll say on the matter though, I know you guys will defend Twitch's decision to hell and backl.
