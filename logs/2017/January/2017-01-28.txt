[2017-01-28 19:38:18 UTC] blue_blur64: BTTV just kept giving me errors yesterday and it wouldn't load the chat
[2017-01-28 19:38:37 UTC] blue_blur64: So I had to turn it off for the H1Z1 stream I was watching
[2017-01-28 19:43:33 UTC] blue_blur64: Oh, and I'm gonna try to play OW with Phil, but no promises. I won't have a mic
[2017-01-28 19:44:27 UTC] theycallmejimbob: are the new game modes any good?
[2017-01-28 19:45:48 UTC] bethe2670: i did chelsea won 4-0 :D

[2017-01-28 19:47:21 UTC] theycallmejimbob: they usually step up against the top teams, they have a great record against the top 6 I think
[2017-01-28 19:47:22 UTC] bethe2670: capture the rooster :D
[2017-01-28 19:47:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: although Firmino wont be playing he is in court for a drink driving charge :P
[2017-01-28 19:47:41 UTC] blue_blur64: You have to really change how you normally go about playing. It's more like soccer in a way
[2017-01-28 19:48:11 UTC] theycallmejimbob: they went from hockey to soccer :P
[2017-01-28 19:48:16 UTC] blue_blur64: And pretty much anyone can get the flag (which has a rooster pic on it) :P
[2017-01-28 19:48:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: pressure is on Silent for you to capture the flag
[2017-01-28 19:48:48 UTC] blue_blur64: I've done it with Lucio before
[2017-01-28 19:49:06 UTC] blue_blur64: Although Sombra is broken when it comes to getting the flag because of her teleporter
[2017-01-28 19:49:45 UTC] bethe2670: capture the flag ft phil, silent and posicolo :D
[2017-01-28 19:49:51 UTC] theycallmejimbob: so Phil will be playing a team of Sombras :P

[2017-01-28 20:02:13 UTC] blue_blur64: Angry Joe was tempted to give the movie a 0. That's how bad it is
