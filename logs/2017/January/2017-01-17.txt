[2017-01-17 00:45:17 UTC] gineriella: peace bitches
[2017-01-17 00:45:20 UTC] injuredisalright: Are we done for the night?
[2017-01-17 00:45:23 UTC] psgamer59: @battlefieldfriends5 yeah
[2017-01-17 00:45:24 UTC] shotinthedeep: later homies
[2017-01-17 00:45:28 UTC] bammbino: unity killed AC for me
[2017-01-17 00:45:32 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: bye everyone
[2017-01-17 00:45:34 UTC] bammbino: didnt even buy the lastest one
[2017-01-17 00:45:41 UTC] wan_ki_moon: If he's doing this run because he had his hand held by summons and stream chat on his first playthrough why is everyone trying to help him
[2017-01-17 00:45:41 UTC] gorillabaz: Hey mr viking I could let you pay me money and I might even let you suck my member
[2017-01-17 00:45:46 UTC] keithstephen2015: How far is he in the playthrough of Dark Souls?
[2017-01-17 00:45:48 UTC] battlefieldfriends5: @psgamer59 anyway cya later man i added ya
[2017-01-17 00:45:55 UTC] paradoxchi: I lost interest in assassins creed after black flag
[2017-01-17 00:46:11 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: exuceme@ gorillabaz?
[2017-01-17 00:46:19 UTC] psgamer59: take care everyone im going to go and catch the train to go and have my dinner
[2017-01-17 00:46:24 UTC] battlefieldfriends5: @paradoxchi yr it did lose its touch
[2017-01-17 00:46:35 UTC] psgamer59: @battlefieldfriends5 ok take care bye
[2017-01-17 00:46:48 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, one thing is telling him exactly how to do shit or doing the bosses for him... another is telling where to go to get X done and not waste his time nor hours as he looks all over for something he doesnt know about
[2017-01-17 00:46:54 UTC] gorillabaz: I am joking with you man
[2017-01-17 00:47:05 UTC] gorillabaz: Hope I didn't offend you
[2017-01-17 00:47:25 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, if you like watching someone try to find a needle in the haystack for hours, then good on you.. the rest of us dont have that time and he doesnt either
[2017-01-17 00:47:30 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: Non taken
[2017-01-17 00:47:48 UTC] paradoxchi: I'm all for people nt telling Phils how to get OP shit and how to go about beating bosses, but telling him where things are I can understand, otherwise he'll just be running around for an hour looking for it, which sounds like great fun dosent it?
[2017-01-17 00:47:49 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @Bammbino but people are telling him exact stuff like about the skeleton blacksmith and havel
[2017-01-17 00:48:12 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, he doesnt know where havel is.. they told him where, not how
[2017-01-17 00:48:21 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @Bammbino and alot of the s
[2017-01-17 00:48:42 UTC] gorillabaz: Damn I am determined to complete DS3
[2017-01-17 00:48:48 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @Bammbino they chat he red out where exact directions to havel
[2017-01-17 00:48:48 UTC] keithstephen2015: What's DSP's opinion of usf2 the new challengers for the Nintendo Switch?
[2017-01-17 00:48:49 UTC] yacherdy: Did you know northerners call dinner "tea"
[2017-01-17 00:48:49 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: exactly, him getting directions is just fine. Watching someone go around aimleslly isn't that cool
[2017-01-17 00:48:50 UTC] gorillabaz: Need to get some tips
[2017-01-17 00:49:18 UTC] bartboulderdash: Where are you stuck, @gorillabaz ?
[2017-01-17 00:49:37 UTC] bammbino: @KeithStephen2015, anything switch related for phil is "shit" he went off on them on twitter
[2017-01-17 00:49:41 UTC] paradoxchi: Eh the only really challenging parts of DK3 were pontiff and Aldrich, the rest is pretty casual in my opinion/
[2017-01-17 00:49:43 UTC] gorillabaz: Hope by watching a elite gamer like Phil would help but I always miss his streams
[2017-01-17 00:50:00 UTC] paradoxchi: Lol "elite gamer"
[2017-01-17 00:50:01 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @Bammbino a lot of this you come across on general exploration, he should have come across havel when in darkroot basin ar if he went in from the tauros demon door
[2017-01-17 00:50:30 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, thats the thing.. you, the others in chat and myself are normal gamers
[2017-01-17 00:50:35 UTC] gorillabaz: I thought Phil was the best overall gamer in the country
[2017-01-17 00:50:38 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, we take our time to explore
[2017-01-17 00:50:56 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, phil knows that if he spent 2 hours trying to find something, people WILL leave
[2017-01-17 00:51:09 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @gorillabaz "he can be good at games if he wants to"
[2017-01-17 00:51:35 UTC] messerscohen: Is it over
[2017-01-17 00:51:38 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, maybe this will calm you down
[2017-01-17 00:51:42 UTC] paradoxchi: It's kind of like pulling the curtain across at a magic show while you're still setting up the stage for the performance, you hink people would be happy about that? haha
[2017-01-17 00:51:51 UTC] paradoxchi: think*
[2017-01-17 00:52:02 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, phil MIGHT do the DLC which is fresh for him if he beats the DS1 stuff ahead of schedule
[2017-01-17 00:52:26 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @Bammbino if he's on xbox he probably won't be able to
[2017-01-17 00:52:43 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, if people tell him where to go, dont you think it'd be a benefit for all of us? we dont sit here watching him be lost and he plays something he didnt
[2017-01-17 00:52:58 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, someone in chat said he already bought the dlc
[2017-01-17 00:53:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: he did
[2017-01-17 00:53:21 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: it's bought and installed
[2017-01-17 00:53:33 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, see? so if he beats the base game before RE7 we get to see the dlc PT
[2017-01-17 00:53:39 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @Bammbino I think the DLC has to be pre-loaded on to a save before you begin the game on xbox or else the area doesnt load
[2017-01-17 00:53:55 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, oh idk about that
[2017-01-17 00:54:11 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I have no idea how, but i expect phil has done the research to do it right
[2017-01-17 00:54:19 UTC] bartboulderdash: Nah, I think all you need to do is wear a certain ring and head back to the hydra waters
[2017-01-17 00:54:19 UTC] paradoxchi: @wan_ki_moon yeah I think you're right there
[2017-01-17 00:54:24 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, none-the-less, we should hope for the best! alot of people say the dlc bosses are tough
[2017-01-17 00:54:47 UTC] paradoxchi: Although i'm not certain myself
[2017-01-17 00:54:53 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @Bammbino you can get the pendant but I dont think manus pulls you in and he won't start up a new game to do it
[2017-01-17 00:55:03 UTC] aleandspirits: the griffon is quite easy
[2017-01-17 00:55:11 UTC] aleandspirits: but the other three are quite tough
[2017-01-17 00:55:18 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, if that happens, we'll get a special salty vlog about how stupid that is LUL
[2017-01-17 00:55:41 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @Bammbino bugged dlc mechanics 8/10
[2017-01-17 00:55:44 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I can not imagine you would have to play it from the begining
[2017-01-17 00:56:00 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, i swapped to xbox when ps3's psn was hacked.. after the xbox one fiaco, i will NEVER go back to xbox
[2017-01-17 00:56:15 UTC] bammbino: @wan_ki_moon, too many issues and bugs like you just mentioned for the dlc
[2017-01-17 00:56:32 UTC] aleandspirits: you dont, the dlc is part loaded anyway, you have access to all the weapons and items through online play
[2017-01-17 00:56:53 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: you do. Ok
[2017-01-17 00:57:01 UTC] wan_ki_moon: @mr_vidar_viking it's happened to me and people I know but we just started a new game and got it Phil doesn't have the patience
[2017-01-17 00:57:22 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: to start over now?
[2017-01-17 00:58:43 UTC] wan_ki_moon: to do another playthrough of dark souls
[2017-01-17 00:59:02 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I don't think that will happen from the beginning again
[2017-01-17 00:59:30 UTC] beld78: @Bammbino Phil already played the DLC on PS3 tho, albeit being helped through it.
[2017-01-17 01:14:52 UTC] darksydephil: FYI I believe the DLC issues were fixed with a patch
[2017-01-17 01:15:08 UTC] darksydephil: bc if you haven't been watching, I already freed the girl in the Hydra lake and got the ring for hte DLC. I just didn't have it installed yet to actually do it
[2017-01-17 01:15:23 UTC] darksydephil: they added that w/a patch when the realized the DLC didn't work initially if you'd already started the game
[2017-01-17 01:19:57 UTC] bammbino: @DarksydePhil, ah, i missed that part! regardless i support your choice if you do the dlc or not

[2017-01-17 20:05:51 UTC] khawaja7: bethe knows alot for someone who hates souls games
[2017-01-17 20:05:53 UTC] popsicolo: LUL

[2017-01-17 20:06:36 UTC] kowareta_yume: Hi phil!
[2017-01-17 20:06:50 UTC] jackwhite2000: i dont hate the souls series in fact i like it
[2017-01-17 20:06:50 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he's reading the guide for the game khawaja7
[2017-01-17 20:06:50 UTC] drilbit777: floe1 floe2
[2017-01-17 20:06:54 UTC] khawaja7: oh guide right.. but you are watching a stream why use a guide for it
[2017-01-17 20:06:57 UTC] retrogarnet47: hmm dspizza
[2017-01-17 20:07:01 UTC] jackwhite2000: i just think the first game is overrated

[2017-01-17 20:07:05 UTC] drilbit777: floe3 floe4
[2017-01-17 20:07:17 UTC] khawaja7: the first game is actually the best in the series
[2017-01-17 20:07:26 UTC] bethe2670: so i know what is coming and so i can laugh when phil dies and rages
[2017-01-17 20:07:32 UTC] jackwhite2000: ehh i think 2 and 3 are better tbh
[2017-01-17 20:07:36 UTC] aleandspirits: yeah, normal weapons win out after a couple of playthroughs, black knight weapons plateau and dont have very good scaling in anything
[2017-01-17 20:07:39 UTC] retrogarnet47: did phil beat demon souls ??
[2017-01-17 20:07:49 UTC] khawaja7: 2 doesn't even come close and 3 is too linear for it to be called the best one
[2017-01-17 20:07:51 UTC] bethe2670: its like playing a game then watching someone play it, same thing really
[2017-01-17 20:07:55 UTC] pr34ch: DarksydePhil didn't you have another bkh?
[2017-01-17 20:07:57 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i think 2 and 3 were a big step down

[2017-01-17 20:08:12 UTC] theycallmejimbob: damn that create character fanart
[2017-01-17 20:08:12 UTC] xgameofpwns: Phil Beat demons souls but he basically cheesed every boss with magic
[2017-01-17 20:08:16 UTC] aleandspirits: that would be amazing
[2017-01-17 20:08:21 UTC] jackwhite2000: also bloodborne was better than 2 and 3
[2017-01-17 20:08:34 UTC] khawaja7: dark souls has alot of unique areas to it like Tomb of the giants, Anor Londo, Blighttown, Sen's fortress
[2017-01-17 20:08:40 UTC] retrogarnet47: lol the fanart
[2017-01-17 20:08:42 UTC] xgameofpwns: Kalameet is the best fight in DS1 imo

[2017-01-17 20:13:26 UTC] darksydephil: by the way, i think the reason my stream had iissues yesterday is twitch. im streaming at 3.5kbps consistently, but twitch is saying there's dips below 3k which is incorrect
[2017-01-17 20:13:27 UTC] aleandspirits: fun fact, the world record for all bosses has been broken for every souls game and bloodborne in the last few days

[2017-01-17 20:57:17 UTC] sickvenom215: Every souls fans knows havels is cheesy
[2017-01-17 20:57:17 UTC] xgameofpwns: lol
[2017-01-17 20:57:18 UTC] amineo2: You can't tell me he hasn't read a guide there
[2017-01-17 20:57:18 UTC] bethe2670: that is good too
[2017-01-17 20:57:19 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Havel wearing player are hated in DS1 PvP xD
[2017-01-17 20:57:19 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Ju-On is insanely scary for the fact its like a virus
[2017-01-17 20:57:30 UTC] aleandspirits: not as much as giants
[2017-01-17 20:57:34 UTC] michaelbf851: pot noodle so good omg
[2017-01-17 20:57:37 UTC] lvlpower: I sleep at the last stream @theycallmejimbob lol
[2017-01-17 20:57:38 UTC] khawaja7: the REC movies were great
[2017-01-17 20:57:38 UTC] m1necrafthalo: what is Phils LVL right now?

[2017-01-17 20:57:49 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: I didnt think the american version was bad, a good attempt but still inferior to the Japanese version
[2017-01-17 20:57:54 UTC] phoenixrising2015: There is one movie where you see an empty city with just missing signs everywhere due do the Grudge Curse causing the end of the world
[2017-01-17 20:57:54 UTC] soultriforcesnake: Can't wait until he fights the four kings XD
[2017-01-17 20:57:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: lol lvlpower

[2017-01-17 20:58:08 UTC] hi_from_france: to be honest, i was wearing this armor the first time i have finish dark souls
[2017-01-17 20:58:28 UTC] amineo2: @SoulTriforceSnake First try, he is full Havel with BKH, that's the best strategy against 4 Kings
[2017-01-17 20:58:34 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Should be called the cheese run not the redemption run
[2017-01-17 20:58:35 UTC] toiletanesthesia: this is his third tho
[2017-01-17 20:58:38 UTC] ingenium215: Ya'll are giving Phil way to much credit
[2017-01-17 20:58:42 UTC] duckwings: does he have the ring ?

[2017-01-17 20:58:50 UTC] punishedmac: yes @Duckwings
[2017-01-17 20:58:50 UTC] aleandspirits: oh shit
[2017-01-17 20:58:52 UTC] amineo2: He knows that poise tanking is the best strategy to cheese the 4 Kings
[2017-01-17 20:58:52 UTC] oneclassysquirrel: Normal games: not wearing the best armour would cause people to call you stupid. Dark Souls: wearing the best armour is cheating xD xD
[2017-01-17 20:58:53 UTC] duckwings: kk
[2017-01-17 20:58:56 UTC] bethe2670: fuck a dark souls cosplay lol full suit of armour a fake shield and fake weapon
[2017-01-17 20:58:56 UTC] brutalny: yea, this is a glam run he is using all overpowered equipment
[2017-01-17 20:58:57 UTC] aleandspirits: he wont be able to wear havels
[2017-01-17 20:59:00 UTC] donniedarksouls: facecam, death counter, no balls
[2017-01-17 20:59:02 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hopefully there will be a few boss fights lvlpower :D
[2017-01-17 20:59:05 UTC] soultriforcesnake: it might be the best but he isn't exactly good
[2017-01-17 20:59:11 UTC] euffy: At the start of the run "Luls Phils build is so bad". Now "omg his build is cheese". Can't please people ^^
[2017-01-17 20:59:20 UTC] yacherdy: My dream is to cosplay as Phillip one day.
[2017-01-17 20:59:22 UTC] aleandspirits: he'll have to swap out havels ring for the abyss ring
[2017-01-17 20:59:24 UTC] chaosalltheway: DS isn't a "normal" game
[2017-01-17 20:59:25 UTC] soultriforcesnake: I would like to see him parry any enemy
[2017-01-17 20:59:31 UTC] royal_phalanx91: A hardcore player would do a naked run :D I think people have done a no armor run before
[2017-01-17 20:59:41 UTC] donniedarksouls: you're right aleanspirits
[2017-01-17 20:59:47 UTC] kingjadvcmp: I watched part of a naked run before, was quite ridiculous
[2017-01-17 20:59:51 UTC] donniedarksouls: a glimour of hope
[2017-01-17 20:59:55 UTC] lvlpower: @theycallmejimbob ok thank I sleep he was stuck at the one castle
[2017-01-17 20:59:56 UTC] kingjadvcmp: glimmer
[2017-01-17 20:59:57 UTC] soultriforcesnake: I did a level 1 run of this before
[2017-01-17 20:59:59 UTC] bethe2670: yacherdy that is easy just get a goatee and a push back your hair and you are already there
[2017-01-17 21:00:03 UTC] phoenixrising2015: Might as well do a naked run if you are going to do a no hit run
[2017-01-17 21:00:07 UTC] bethe2670: just gott put on some clothes too
[2017-01-17 21:00:10 UTC] oneclassysquirrel: Naked run is pretty easy in DS1 cos of those iframes
[2017-01-17 21:00:11 UTC] donniedarksouls: but still bkh will tear through four kings
[2017-01-17 21:00:16 UTC] soultriforcesnake: and a non bonfire run in 2
[2017-01-17 21:00:17 UTC] auxitius: you'll needto gain a few pounds also
[2017-01-17 21:00:18 UTC] amineo2: @Euffy He is doing the run with videos/guides, that's not like a legit playthrough he does on his own, at this point I would've preffered a Jak 3 playthrough or another attempt at Bloodborne DLC
[2017-01-17 21:00:28 UTC] brutalny: he already beat it so to play like this is ResidentSleeper
[2017-01-17 21:00:31 UTC] hi_from_france: i came here with no prefix ideas, i am here to see dsp in action and see who is he.
[2017-01-17 21:00:34 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I think Phil sold bloodborne
[2017-01-17 21:00:47 UTC] xxxnemesisxxx: let me guess, he got Havel's Ring ??
[2017-01-17 21:00:49 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: nice from you france
[2017-01-17 21:00:51 UTC] euffy: @Amineo2 Could be, I just found it funny how people change their opinion about the build itself :)
[2017-01-17 21:00:53 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: for
[2017-01-17 21:00:53 UTC] lvlpower: I'm surprised that Phil will be playing dlc
[2017-01-17 21:00:57 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i used a greatshield and full black iron armor on my first playthrough and i felt so bad for the bosses
[2017-01-17 21:01:02 UTC] bobbi_ling: did phil pay $15 for the dlc lol
[2017-01-17 21:01:09 UTC] soultriforcesnake: if he doesn't have havels ring he would be like a slug
[2017-01-17 21:01:14 UTC] shotinthedeep: yea i think he did
[2017-01-17 21:01:15 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: yes @Bobbi_ling
[2017-01-17 21:01:15 UTC] lightweightbro: no he still has BB, he showed it in his last walkthrough, he hasnt been back to gamestop because he downloads all his new games now
[2017-01-17 21:01:17 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Heavy rolling lul
[2017-01-17 21:01:21 UTC] gaylordbutthump: i still use black iron armor cause fashion and poise on heavy builds but still
[2017-01-17 21:01:26 UTC] gaylordbutthump: no more greatshields
[2017-01-17 21:01:32 UTC] sickvenom215: Yea this isn't a challenge anymore. Takes away from the fun and intrigue. Running around one shotting enemies is not interesting
[2017-01-17 21:01:35 UTC] 1buttondash: @Bobbi_Ling what's funny about that? isnt' that the cost of it
[2017-01-17 21:01:37 UTC] arthosfromtkoh: Watch the price drop after he bought it xD
[2017-01-17 21:01:43 UTC] lvlpower: lol
[2017-01-17 21:01:44 UTC] yacherdy: $15 for 4-6 hour DLC really isn't a rip off.
[2017-01-17 21:01:45 UTC] amineo2: I still don't even know if he will be able ti cheese the DLC aswell, but I don't think it's gonna be the case since the bosses aren't pushovers
[2017-01-17 21:01:47 UTC] soultriforcesnake: congrats
[2017-01-17 21:01:48 UTC] auxitius: agreed
[2017-01-17 21:01:49 UTC] sickvenom215: The chat itself is entertaining how ever
[2017-01-17 21:02:00 UTC] bobbi_ling: yeah but its more expensive than the actual game
[2017-01-17 21:02:05 UTC] euffy: What poise does?
[2017-01-17 21:02:05 UTC] retrogarnet47: release the Krakan
[2017-01-17 21:02:06 UTC] soultriforcesnake: now this is important phil what ending do you want to get?
[2017-01-17 21:02:11 UTC] royal_phalanx91: This pt was much more fun to watch before he got all this badass shit, definitely
[2017-01-17 21:02:12 UTC] lvlpower: There price drop to $10 dlc
[2017-01-17 21:02:12 UTC] reversehollow: dlc has the arena, very worth.
[2017-01-17 21:02:21 UTC] soultriforcesnake: get the dark ending
[2017-01-17 21:02:23 UTC] xxxnemesisxxx: 4 kings with havel set ... *sigh*
[2017-01-17 21:02:24 UTC] bethe2670: WRONG bobbi phil bought this game for 20 dollars
[2017-01-17 21:02:28 UTC] xgameofpwns: uhh Phil you might want to kindle 20 Estus for this area
[2017-01-17 21:02:29 UTC] bobbi_ling: forest > arena
[2017-01-17 21:02:30 UTC] bethe2670: and the dlc was only 15
[2017-01-17 21:02:31 UTC] ix_ryno_ix: omg I farmed so many of those dark guys...cant remember why
[2017-01-17 21:02:32 UTC] soultriforcesnake: can he still get the dark ending?
[2017-01-17 21:02:40 UTC] yacherdy: That's Namo Bandai's problem Kappa
[2017-01-17 21:02:41 UTC] punishedmac: he gonna be fatrolling though so it'll still be interesting
[2017-01-17 21:02:48 UTC] royal_phalanx91: I heard the DS3 DLC was overpriced because it was so short
[2017-01-17 21:02:49 UTC] yacherdy: Namco*
[2017-01-17 21:02:50 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: does people still play that arena though?
[2017-01-17 21:02:58 UTC] brutalny: nothing he could do
[2017-01-17 21:02:59 UTC] khawaja7: the first DkS3 DLC yea
[2017-01-17 21:03:01 UTC] aleandspirits: yes, theres no pre-requisites for endings in this game
[2017-01-17 21:03:01 UTC] gaylordbutthump: he's not gonna let himself fat roll
[2017-01-17 21:03:05 UTC] hi_from_france: for pvp ?
[2017-01-17 21:03:09 UTC] reversehollow: Forest is a hive of scum and villainy.
[2017-01-17 21:03:13 UTC] soultriforcesnake: people don't really play the arena anymore
[2017-01-17 21:03:16 UTC] reversehollow: Arena all day.
[2017-01-17 21:03:21 UTC] bobbi_ling: that's why forest is good
[2017-01-17 21:03:23 UTC] aleandspirits: you either link the flame (stupid ending) or walk out like a badass
[2017-01-17 21:03:29 UTC] gaylordbutthump: see LUL
[2017-01-17 21:03:35 UTC] lvlpower: Phil wearing Ginat armor
[2017-01-17 21:03:37 UTC] xxxnemesisxxx: oh yeah
[2017-01-17 21:03:58 UTC] aleandspirits: its all about sens pvp
[2017-01-17 21:03:59 UTC] xxxnemesisxxx: or he can break FaP ring Kappa

[2017-01-17 21:04:06 UTC] bobbi_ling: undead burger fight clubs
[2017-01-17 21:04:13 UTC] lvlpower: Beast mode
[2017-01-17 21:04:19 UTC] aleandspirits: fap ring is so bad, it limits you so much
[2017-01-17 21:04:21 UTC] kg1772: go human ffs
[2017-01-17 21:04:23 UTC] royal_phalanx91: Never encountered a fight club before
[2017-01-17 21:04:28 UTC] bethe2670: undead burger?
[2017-01-17 21:04:31 UTC] aleandspirits: its all about dark wood grain ring and havels
[2017-01-17 21:04:34 UTC] gaylordbutthump: the benefits of fap ring are amazing though
[2017-01-17 21:04:39 UTC] soultriforcesnake: they break phil
[2017-01-17 21:04:40 UTC] bobbi_ling: yes beth
[2017-01-17 21:04:40 UTC] retrogarnet47: has phil found any secret walls
[2017-01-17 21:04:40 UTC] yacherdy: Fap ring just gets in the way
[2017-01-17 21:04:42 UTC] aleandspirits: they're not
[2017-01-17 21:04:45 UTC] royal_phalanx91: In my playthrough of DS3 a mage recently invaded me and rekt me :D
[2017-01-17 21:04:47 UTC] aleandspirits: it gets in the way
[2017-01-17 21:04:48 UTC] bethe2670: ewww bobbi
[2017-01-17 21:04:53 UTC] noko4dayz: he should break fap ring
[2017-01-17 21:05:00 UTC] soultriforcesnake: those rings would be good for you XD
[2017-01-17 21:05:01 UTC] xxxnemesisxxx: fap ring is really op compared to its successors

[2017-01-17 22:19:22 UTC] khawaja7: @Veronix_x, though the scholar of the first sin version actually puts alot of enemies in alot of areas to make you face some artificial difficulty
[2017-01-17 22:19:22 UTC] rbreezay: Phils making me frustrated
[2017-01-17 22:19:23 UTC] thegr8beef: then don't fight it?
[2017-01-17 22:19:23 UTC] vapenation42069: He has some of the best armor and weapons in the game and still can't kill this early game mid boss thing

[2017-01-17 22:19:51 UTC] snipertheladiesman: the definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over and over again... expecting shit to change
[2017-01-17 22:19:52 UTC] veronix_x: I do have scholar of the first sin version.
[2017-01-17 22:20:00 UTC] xgameofpwns: he's doing this until break so he can look at the guide
[2017-01-17 22:20:09 UTC] khawaja7: @Veronix_x, then yea expect some artificial difficulty in quite a few areas

[2017-01-17 22:20:29 UTC] chocraisain: what is "artificial difficulty"?
[2017-01-17 22:20:29 UTC] jango_fett_boba_fett: Why is phill trying to kill the drake?

[2017-01-17 22:20:43 UTC] snipertheladiesman: y undead parish bonfire theres one right at the bridge
[2017-01-17 22:20:49 UTC] misterlightningbolt: apply pine resin to your weapon or some other buff so you can dps it before it goes
[2017-01-17 22:20:49 UTC] ethershulk: okay, if you teleport yourself to undead burg it should spawn too, so why undead perish?
[2017-01-17 22:20:49 UTC] vendatus: 2 hours later still trying to kill Drake LUL
[2017-01-17 22:20:50 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I guess because it is challening
[2017-01-17 22:20:51 UTC] memeassmod: @chocraisain oh look, that ancient buzzword Kappa
[2017-01-17 22:20:52 UTC] nerv117: he heals if u use bow
[2017-01-17 22:20:56 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Phil, don't bother with the Hellkite, he gives nothing but medicore souls. If you want his tail, just shoot his tail with arrows or something.
[2017-01-17 22:20:57 UTC] punishedmac: My favorite thing about this is how it never crosses his mind to try to improve his fire resistance
[2017-01-17 22:20:58 UTC] dantseb: use armor strong against fire
[2017-01-17 22:20:59 UTC] beverast666: try quitting out and restarting...might work or might not...will save time if it does
[2017-01-17 22:21:02 UTC] khawaja7: @chocraisain, adding a shit ton of enemies in one place just to make it harder
[2017-01-17 22:21:07 UTC] iconicmaster1: Dlc FailFish
[2017-01-17 22:21:07 UTC] lightweightbro: Phil come on man, the entire chat voted DLC and you're wasting all this time on Hellkite :/
[2017-01-17 22:21:07 UTC] optionalsuperboss: Snipertheladiesman, thats actually not a definintion of insanity. its an albert einstein quote
[2017-01-17 22:21:13 UTC] veronix_x: Because Drake provoked him. Said: "Ever since I left city.. you...."
[2017-01-17 22:21:14 UTC] veronix_x: :D
[2017-01-17 22:21:20 UTC] jango_fett_boba_fett: I guess it's challenging but he's wasting valuable stream time he could use for the DLC.
[2017-01-17 22:21:23 UTC] chocraisain: @khawaja7 how is that "artificial"?
[2017-01-17 22:21:34 UTC] theycallmejimbob: if he doesn't beat the drake,the redemption run will be forever tainted
[2017-01-17 22:21:40 UTC] jango_fett_boba_fett: Lol
[2017-01-17 22:21:43 UTC] salv88: he needs Flash Sweat pyromancy+fire res ring and great fire res armor
[2017-01-17 22:21:43 UTC] memeassmod: everything is artificial, this isn't real life
[2017-01-17 22:21:50 UTC] snipertheladiesman: @OptionalSuperboss yeah i know its a quote form AE, but i'm also using it from farcry 3
[2017-01-17 22:21:55 UTC] jango_fett_boba_fett: He needs to fight Gwyndolin
[2017-01-17 22:21:57 UTC] iconicmaster1: All this for some souls FailFish WutFace
[2017-01-17 22:22:09 UTC] veronix_x: 4-0 for Drake.
[2017-01-17 22:22:09 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: think it is for the challenge
[2017-01-17 22:22:13 UTC] misterlightningbolt: gold hemmed armor has fire resist
[2017-01-17 22:22:14 UTC] taniaraven: i've killed this with arrows
[2017-01-17 22:22:22 UTC] khawaja7: @chocraisain, its artificial when the level design is not as good, the enemies or any of the bosses since most of them are easy to fight but to make it challenging, just simply place alot of those in confined areas
[2017-01-17 22:22:26 UTC] levinds: one hit then go back to the wall
[2017-01-17 22:22:29 UTC] ash0787: dragons are weak to C4
[2017-01-17 22:22:32 UTC] undeadelvis85: will he do a ds2 redemption run as people held his hand through that aswell
[2017-01-17 22:22:35 UTC] theycallmejimbob: here we go
[2017-01-17 22:22:43 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: if he is going to cheese it he might as well skip it
[2017-01-17 22:22:47 UTC] memeassmod: dark souls is pretty damn fair
[2017-01-17 22:22:54 UTC] misterlightningbolt: i hope he does a DS2 scholar of the first sin edition run

[2017-01-17 22:53:55 UTC] slickgamble: Oh god WutFace
[2017-01-17 22:54:12 UTC] memeassmod: @chocraisain I use ABP and still get twitch ads when he runs them
[2017-01-17 22:54:43 UTC] chocraisain: @memeassmod using request policy and there's a list of about 20 things blocked...
[2017-01-17 22:54:54 UTC] nerv117: @unquietmist, comes out next tuesday
[2017-01-17 22:54:57 UTC] somefatguysarm: i think Phil would have a rough time in NG+
[2017-01-17 22:55:02 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: phil has hacked you and broken your defences then @memessmod
[2017-01-17 22:55:14 UTC] nerv117: well monday at 10pm pst
[2017-01-17 22:55:19 UTC] jaykirkbride: Isn't NG+ a bit easier? I'm finding it is so far @Somefatguysarm
[2017-01-17 22:55:44 UTC] snipertheladiesman: @JayKirkbride imo ng+ was really easy
[2017-01-17 22:55:57 UTC] somefatguysarm: It depends, using just tank builds never works for me NG+ but dex builds work great
[2017-01-17 22:56:00 UTC] jaykirkbride: @Snipertheladiesman and more fun :P
[2017-01-17 22:56:01 UTC] chocraisain: are ads displaying now? when does he put them on?
[2017-01-17 22:56:07 UTC] retrogarnet47: talking about DLC he should go back to the Bloodborne DLC and beat Ludwig
[2017-01-17 22:56:15 UTC] tenpiece32: @mr_vidar_viking notice how its at the expense of his "funny" commentary. Hard to do both
[2017-01-17 22:56:19 UTC] thegr8beef: the second time around is easier because you know what to do and where to go.
[2017-01-17 22:56:23 UTC] jaykirkbride: I wish i could play Bloodborne
[2017-01-17 22:56:32 UTC] jaykirkbride: Yeah, thats true
[2017-01-17 22:57:04 UTC] chocraisain: when are ads running? so I can test unblocking them
[2017-01-17 22:57:06 UTC] thegr8beef: also he is never going back to the Old Hunters..sadly.
[2017-01-17 22:57:06 UTC] tenpiece32: guess Phil won't make jokes on games anymore and take them serious...poof haters will be gone then
[2017-01-17 22:57:15 UTC] jaykirkbride: I've only recently beat it for the first time haha, I never wanted to play it because I thought you couldn't fast travel :P
[2017-01-17 22:57:33 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: @tenpice32 dark souls is a really melancolic game Hard to get so much humor out of
[2017-01-17 22:57:40 UTC] jaykirkbride: But out of all the souls game, the first one is definitely my favourite
[2017-01-17 22:57:41 UTC] snipertheladiesman: @JayKirkbride yes i was a pyromancer but used the claymore the whole game and found most of the bosses fairly easy and i think only died to like 3 bosses once, all the rest i beat on first try
[2017-01-17 22:57:56 UTC] thegr8beef: Otzdarva disagrees...
[2017-01-17 22:58:06 UTC] punishedmac: claymore is really good in DS1
[2017-01-17 22:58:09 UTC] corey_2293: ResidentSleeper
[2017-01-17 22:58:13 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: when I have played it for 10 hours straight I feel a bit gloomy actually
[2017-01-17 22:58:16 UTC] jaykirkbride: Snipertheladiesman Oh god yes, I loved the pyromancy in this game! I don't think I'd be able to last long without it haha
[2017-01-17 22:58:20 UTC] corey_2293: DSP doing bloodborne again?
[2017-01-17 22:58:54 UTC] tenpiece32: @mr_vidar_viking most games he was bad at was because he didn't take them serious and just made jokes all the time
[2017-01-17 22:58:55 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: not as far as I know
[2017-01-17 22:59:07 UTC] snipertheladiesman: @punishedmac yeah it is favourite weapon but honestly didn't experiment much with weapons, once i used the claymore and started upgrading it i kept it
[2017-01-17 22:59:10 UTC] corey_2293: bloodborne broke him
[2017-01-17 22:59:12 UTC] slickgamble: For a firsttime playthough of a souls/borne game, I'll always recommend dks1 first. It's a genre defining classic.
[2017-01-17 22:59:20 UTC] tenpiece32: notice how DSP is not joking at all with this game
[2017-01-17 22:59:21 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: @tenpiece32 if you feel that way, why are you complaining?
[2017-01-17 22:59:38 UTC] lightweightbro: I wonder if Phil and Leanna will get married soon
[2017-01-17 22:59:51 UTC] tenpiece32: @mr_vidar_viking not complaining but how long will it last?
[2017-01-17 23:00:01 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: til it is over
[2017-01-17 23:00:01 UTC] jaykirkbride: Why do a lot of people now call him asexual? have i missed something xD
[2017-01-17 23:00:16 UTC] lightweightbro: whos asexual?
[2017-01-17 23:00:26 UTC] thegr8beef: Gwyndolin
[2017-01-17 23:00:30 UTC] lightweightbro: oh
[2017-01-17 23:00:31 UTC] jaykirkbride: I see people on YouTube calling him asexual :')
[2017-01-17 23:00:36 UTC] tenpiece32: I have skipped so many games I loved when DSP played them because of the jokes and he never took them serious
[2017-01-17 23:00:36 UTC] jaykirkbride: Phil

[2017-01-17 23:01:03 UTC] thegr8beef: Bsexual
[2017-01-17 23:01:06 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I understand if you are raised as a girl that you would be more femenin maybe but your voice would not be like a girls

[2017-01-17 23:03:39 UTC] chocraisain: hey can someone tell me when a twitch ad normally plays? I want to support Phil
[2017-01-17 23:03:40 UTC] iconicmaster1: Miley Cyrus said she was a pan sexual

[2017-01-17 23:04:07 UTC] mr_vidar_viking: I don't belive pan sexual is a thing though. Can't imagine that you can be attracted to young woman and old man at the same time
[2017-01-17 23:04:25 UTC] lightweightbro: yeah thats odd
[2017-01-17 23:04:43 UTC] euffy: Pansexual is a thing. Rude.

[2017-01-17 23:04:53 UTC] jaykirkbride: I believe in pansexual, because I feel like i like people for who they are, not their genitals :P but again, that could just be bisexual!
