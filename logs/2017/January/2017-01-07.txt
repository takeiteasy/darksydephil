[2017-01-07 19:59:38 UTC] ghandi101: didn't you say you wouldn't be here if phil chose dark souls @bethe2670 ?
[2017-01-07 19:59:44 UTC] ghandi101: :P
[2017-01-07 19:59:52 UTC] aleandspirits: would be nice if he just played the game with minimal commentary
[2017-01-07 19:59:52 UTC] bethe2670: i never said that
[2017-01-07 20:00:00 UTC] aleandspirits: seems a shame to lose the momentum from yesterday

[2017-01-07 20:00:08 UTC] ghandi101: pretty sure you did. you said "i wont watch"
[2017-01-07 20:00:41 UTC] bethe2670: wont watch and being in chat are 2 different things, i can pause the video = not watching
[2017-01-07 20:00:54 UTC] theycallmejimbob: that tweet was from 3 hours ago bethe usually he'd tweet around stream time to confirm it isn't going ahead.
[2017-01-07 20:01:02 UTC] thedoctor5437: bethe is a hypocrite burn him NOW
[2017-01-07 20:01:10 UTC] bethe2670: /me gets burnt

[2017-01-07 20:01:42 UTC] bethe2670: hype for no stream

[2017-01-07 20:02:54 UTC] 0megaj0ker: I finally had enough time to shave my crappy beared :D
[2017-01-07 20:02:54 UTC] damdann: He could just get a recording of him screaming and that would work
[2017-01-07 20:03:07 UTC] 0megaj0ker: *Beard
[2017-01-07 20:03:09 UTC] lvlpower: no face cam

[2017-01-07 20:06:01 UTC] splitplaythru: so no dark souls today. Phil can still stream, he just doesn't have to talk.
[2017-01-07 20:06:04 UTC] bethe2670: bobbi, dragin, creepy and then when they start gino, jimbob and no hero join in
[2017-01-07 20:06:18 UTC] bethe2670: hence 6 peeps poking me
[2017-01-07 20:06:36 UTC] ghandi101: seems like you have a list made.... i feel like i don't want to make that list
[2017-01-07 20:06:41 UTC] ghandi101: :P
[2017-01-07 20:06:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: bethe2670, you should put me on ignore if I'm upsetting you that much :(
[2017-01-07 20:07:04 UTC] ghandi101: oh its all in good fun

[2017-01-07 20:10:23 UTC] bethe2670: Seth Rollins?
[2017-01-07 20:10:29 UTC] theycallmejimbob: heel turn
[2017-01-07 20:11:10 UTC] bethe2670: well considering Seth Rollins, Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose are all FACES

[2017-01-07 20:12:09 UTC] ghandi101: how many times will phil die against Ornstein and smough?
[2017-01-07 20:12:12 UTC] podusmonens: I know
[2017-01-07 20:12:17 UTC] podusmonens: but he said he might stream
[2017-01-07 20:12:24 UTC] podusmonens: I was making a prediction
[2017-01-07 20:12:29 UTC] podusmonens: it wasn't a question
[2017-01-07 20:12:37 UTC] deltaforce355: "There's absolutely no way I can stream today unless my throat improves. Sorry all, I want more Dark Souls as much as you do, and now this."
[2017-01-07 20:12:40 UTC] ghandi101: my guess is he will summon for that fight
[2017-01-07 20:12:56 UTC] podusmonens: yep, and my prediction was his throat is fuccd
[2017-01-07 20:12:58 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no summons,no excuses redemption run Ghandi101 :P
[2017-01-07 20:13:11 UTC] podusmonens: but we'll see
[2017-01-07 20:13:21 UTC] ghandi101: uh huh @theycallmejimbob sure! :P.

[2017-01-07 20:13:44 UTC] podusmonens: no excuses, no off days
[2017-01-07 20:13:46 UTC] podusmonens: =)
[2017-01-07 20:13:57 UTC] bethe2670: dragin you got no heart
[2017-01-07 20:13:59 UTC] bethe2670: :P
[2017-01-07 20:14:01 UTC] ghandi101: i actually beat them on my first try. took me about an hour though because i was extremely cautious
[2017-01-07 20:14:08 UTC] podusmonens: c'mooon
[2017-01-07 20:14:17 UTC] podusmonens: it's a throat thing, it's not cancer
[2017-01-07 20:14:46 UTC] bethe2670: dragin wait until you are soooo sick you cannot get out of bed and i'll be there telling you to get the fuck up and do some work
[2017-01-07 20:14:47 UTC] deltaforce355: can phil buy the DS 1 DLC?
[2017-01-07 20:14:56 UTC] bethe2670: for 15 bucks
[2017-01-07 20:15:03 UTC] deltaforce355: and?
[2017-01-07 20:15:04 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he said he doesn't want paying the 15 bucks for it
[2017-01-07 20:15:12 UTC] bethe2670: delta and he cant afford it
[2017-01-07 20:15:24 UTC] neonbornspartan9: Whats up weeb, why are you chatting. Phil's not streaming today, stay tune on Twitter if you care.
[2017-01-07 20:15:24 UTC] ghandi101: working from home and working from an office or on site is completely different
[2017-01-07 20:15:28 UTC] deltaforce355: didnt someone gave phil a 100$?
[2017-01-07 20:15:31 UTC] podusmonens: I'm not telling phil to force himself and stream even if he's sick bethe
[2017-01-07 20:15:35 UTC] deltaforce355: last stream?
[2017-01-07 20:15:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: considering you can get the DS1 prepare to die edition on steam for 5 bucks,it is a bit on the expensive side I guess.
[2017-01-07 20:15:54 UTC] ghandi101: lol @theycallmejimbob
[2017-01-07 20:15:57 UTC] bethe2670: he bought the game for 20 bucks and he doesnt want to waste 15 bucks for a few hours of gameplay - phil yesterday
[2017-01-07 20:16:21 UTC] bethe2670: yes delta
[2017-01-07 20:16:24 UTC] ghandi101: how will he waste money?
[2017-01-07 20:16:25 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Just saying, DLC should never cost almost as much as the main game.
[2017-01-07 20:16:30 UTC] podusmonens: next step for phil I think is PC gaming. save some $$$ and buy a gaming pc. steam is great
[2017-01-07 20:16:34 UTC] ghandi101: oh gotcha nevermind
[2017-01-07 20:16:53 UTC] bethe2670: steam is great ahhahahahaha you make me laugh dragin
[2017-01-07 20:17:04 UTC] podusmonens: yes it is
[2017-01-07 20:17:04 UTC] bethe2670: phil is a console gamer like me
[2017-01-07 20:17:14 UTC] deltaforce355: isnt buliding a PC cost less?
[2017-01-07 20:17:20 UTC] ghandi101: favorite console @bethe2670 ?
[2017-01-07 20:17:24 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Typically Delta.
[2017-01-07 20:17:28 UTC] lemonplaysgames: You just have to shop smart.
[2017-01-07 20:17:28 UTC] deltaforce355: *building
[2017-01-07 20:17:33 UTC] bethe2670: ps4 ghandi
[2017-01-07 20:17:44 UTC] ghandi101: favorite game?
[2017-01-07 20:17:48 UTC] bethe2670: phil doesnt have like 1000 bucks to spend
[2017-01-07 20:17:52 UTC] podusmonens: I just hope phil will change his mind like he did on a lot of things
[2017-01-07 20:17:53 UTC] bethe2670: he has debts
[2017-01-07 20:18:03 UTC] sipuli91: how weak is his immune system? he's sick pretty much 24/7/365
[2017-01-07 20:18:04 UTC] deltaforce355: but again, building a pc cost less
[2017-01-07 20:18:06 UTC] podusmonens: like direct capture, he said he will NEVER do that
[2017-01-07 20:18:08 UTC] goldencolts: how is phil sick again? its been like a month lmao
[2017-01-07 20:18:12 UTC] podusmonens: and here we are
[2017-01-07 20:18:16 UTC] bethe2670: yes i know dragin
[2017-01-07 20:18:20 UTC] ghandi101: that's what i said @Goldencolts
[2017-01-07 20:18:21 UTC] podusmonens: he said he will NEVER use gaming headphones
[2017-01-07 20:18:28 UTC] scofield_alexander: hello peps
[2017-01-07 20:18:32 UTC] theycallmejimbob: hey scofield
[2017-01-07 20:18:33 UTC] bethe2670: but getting direct capture is less than a new gaming pc
[2017-01-07 20:18:34 UTC] podusmonens: he got to the point where he was reviewing phones
[2017-01-07 20:19:03 UTC] podusmonens: maybe he can sell the old one
[2017-01-07 20:19:06 UTC] goldencolts: maybe he has autoimmune disease *free shrugs*
[2017-01-07 20:19:06 UTC] ghandi101: aren't direct capture devices pretty inexpensive?
[2017-01-07 20:19:07 UTC] podusmonens: dunno
[2017-01-07 20:19:09 UTC] bethe2670: goldencolts leanna
[2017-01-07 20:19:27 UTC] podusmonens: ghandi I just mean he changed his mind on things he was adamant about
[2017-01-07 20:19:32 UTC] podusmonens: it's not about money
[2017-01-07 20:19:32 UTC] splitplaythru: DSP was still fervently looking at stream chat yesterday. O.o
[2017-01-07 20:19:39 UTC] duckhuntt: yes
[2017-01-07 20:19:39 UTC] ghandi101: oh okay
[2017-01-07 20:19:55 UTC] theycallmejimbob: no SplitPlaythru he looks away from the mic to breathe
[2017-01-07 20:19:57 UTC] ghandi101: you are correct @SplitPlaythru
[2017-01-07 20:20:00 UTC] bethe2670: ghandi they are not that expensive and thats my point he can aford that but not a new gaming pc or parts
[2017-01-07 20:20:03 UTC] ghandi101: lol
[2017-01-07 20:20:14 UTC] sipuli91: he's been looking like crap for months. perhaos the stress is getting to him
[2017-01-07 20:20:26 UTC] podusmonens: he can sell his psvr trololol
[2017-01-07 20:20:37 UTC] bethe2670: he should i agree
[2017-01-07 20:20:44 UTC] ghandi101: he missed the bottomless box and the repair kit from the vendor and like five items so far. so i guess stream chat isn't helping with EVERYTHING
[2017-01-07 20:20:54 UTC] duckhuntt: what time is it?
[2017-01-07 20:21:00 UTC] deltaforce355: but he still need to experince the porn VR
[2017-01-07 20:21:10 UTC] bethe2670: this is a legit no bullshit no excuses run
[2017-01-07 20:21:17 UTC] bethe2670: so of course he misses shit
[2017-01-07 20:21:19 UTC] poopmano: hey am I late?
[2017-01-07 20:21:20 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he might use VR with Resident evil 7
[2017-01-07 20:21:20 UTC] podusmonens: he could save some money 'cause steam games are cheaper and they have sales
[2017-01-07 20:21:26 UTC] podusmonens: dunno..
[2017-01-07 20:21:42 UTC] theycallmejimbob: humble monthly bundle was pretty good this month
[2017-01-07 20:21:44 UTC] bethe2670: late to a non existent stream no you are not late at all
[2017-01-07 20:21:46 UTC] splitplaythru: jim, why would he need to look away from mic to breathe? he doesn't do that when he burps and that other stuff. he looks at stream chat, plain as day
[2017-01-07 20:22:00 UTC] poopmano: oh okay thats good, phew.
[2017-01-07 20:22:05 UTC] goldencolts: poop man u missed the whole stream
[2017-01-07 20:22:11 UTC] goldencolts: bethe is just trolling
[2017-01-07 20:22:19 UTC] deltaforce355: what do you guys think is better?

[2017-01-07 20:22:24 UTC] deltaforce355: PC or console?
[2017-01-07 20:22:29 UTC] bethe2670: read his twitter :D
[2017-01-07 20:22:30 UTC] deltaforce355: just asking
[2017-01-07 20:22:31 UTC] bethe2670: proof
[2017-01-07 20:22:31 UTC] theycallmejimbob: lol SplitPlaythru it's a reference to a youtube video chocolate rain :P It was a tongue in cheek comment
[2017-01-07 20:22:32 UTC] ghandi101: VR
[2017-01-07 20:22:42 UTC] podusmonens: ideally both, but put a gun to my head and I will answer pc
[2017-01-07 20:23:12 UTC] podusmonens: chocolate rain lol nostalgia
[2017-01-07 20:23:19 UTC] bethe2670: /me puts a gun to dragins head because he keeps on about c
[2017-01-07 20:23:22 UTC] bethe2670: pc*
[2017-01-07 20:23:30 UTC] theycallmejimbob: when evolution of dance was the No1 video on youtube
[2017-01-07 20:23:32 UTC] podusmonens: that guy desperately held on to that yt fame for a while
[2017-01-07 20:23:47 UTC] poopmano: i've been here all night, i've been here all day.
[2017-01-07 20:24:01 UTC] splitplaythru: disappointing that DSP only wants to play games that everyone else is playing =(
[2017-01-07 20:24:23 UTC] podusmonens: what's the point of playing niche games if you want views?
[2017-01-07 20:24:38 UTC] bethe2670: what does niche mean?
[2017-01-07 20:24:39 UTC] podusmonens: it;s nit like he wil be a groundbreaker
[2017-01-07 20:24:55 UTC] podusmonens: that only appeal to a small audience bethe
[2017-01-07 20:25:01 UTC] bethe2670: oh
[2017-01-07 20:25:01 UTC] deltaforce355: to have fun dragin?
[2017-01-07 20:25:04 UTC] ghandi101: every game is a niche audience
[2017-01-07 20:25:18 UTC] podusmonens: he wants to have fun AND get views
[2017-01-07 20:25:22 UTC] ghandi101: so it doesn't matter
[2017-01-07 20:25:25 UTC] splitplaythru: that's the main probelm with dsp. he doesn't have enough subscribers to sustain him. Every other major youtuber will be playing RE7 well before DSP will, even days before him.
[2017-01-07 20:25:42 UTC] poopmano: these friends keep talking way too much say I should give him up.
[2017-01-07 20:25:49 UTC] podusmonens: true ghandi, but some niches are larger :D
[2017-01-07 20:26:26 UTC] deltaforce355: like pokemon?
[2017-01-07 20:26:36 UTC] splitplaythru: like, DSP said that Zelda is niche. What?
[2017-01-07 20:26:39 UTC] podusmonens: like CoD
[2017-01-07 20:27:05 UTC] bethe2670: cod has kids as its fans
[2017-01-07 20:27:07 UTC] bethe2670: smh
[2017-01-07 20:27:07 UTC] theycallmejimbob: it doesn't look promising that a stream is going ahead today :(
[2017-01-07 20:27:15 UTC] podusmonens: it's weird that he hasn't tweeted
[2017-01-07 20:27:19 UTC] podusmonens: usually he announced
[2017-01-07 20:27:21 UTC] bethe2670: i used to be a fan until black ops 2
[2017-01-07 20:27:25 UTC] splitplaythru: he doesn't HAVE to talk
[2017-01-07 20:27:35 UTC] bethe2670: then i left it until last year
[2017-01-07 20:27:36 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: He still hasn't started the prestream?
[2017-01-07 20:27:41 UTC] podusmonens: he can just growl when h erages right?
[2017-01-07 20:27:42 UTC] bethe2670: still not a fan though
[2017-01-07 20:27:46 UTC] podusmonens: !twitter
[2017-01-07 20:27:47 UTC] nightbot: Follow me on Twitter! http://www.twitter.com/theycallmedsp
[2017-01-07 20:27:48 UTC] splitplaythru: it'd be kind of refreshing to have a stream when he doesn't talk
[2017-01-07 20:27:50 UTC] podusmonens: check that
[2017-01-07 20:27:59 UTC] goldencolts: what if RE7 is a huge disappointment and gets a 56 on metacritic BabyRage
[2017-01-07 20:28:05 UTC] bethe2670: lol
[2017-01-07 20:28:26 UTC] bethe2670: to me it loos like a rip off outlast, well the demo did
[2017-01-07 20:28:30 UTC] podusmonens: almost everything sucks according to metacritic
[2017-01-07 20:28:36 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: WOW DOOD I came in here late to avoid the prestream
[2017-01-07 20:28:45 UTC] goldencolts: according to metacritic user scores*
[2017-01-07 20:28:51 UTC] bethe2670: no pre nor actual stream sorry
[2017-01-07 20:28:58 UTC] podusmonens: Phil ‚Äè@TheyCallMeDSP 3h3 hours agoThere's absolutely no way I can stream today unless my throat improves. Sorry all, I want more Dark Souls as much as you do, and now this.
[2017-01-07 20:28:58 UTC] deltaforce355: it will be better than umbrella corps
[2017-01-07 20:28:59 UTC] splitplaythru: too bad, buffet. the prestream didn't avoid you =O
[2017-01-07 20:29:01 UTC] goldencolts: according to critic scores every mediocre ass game is awesome
[2017-01-07 20:29:03 UTC] deltaforce355: just saying
[2017-01-07 20:29:13 UTC] theycallmejimbob: if this redemption run is a success,Phil should move on to other games he recorded using camcorder and do a redemption run on them. Metal Gear Solid series comes to mind :P
[2017-01-07 20:29:28 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: So no stream today? He's regretting picking DS lmao
[2017-01-07 20:29:28 UTC] podusmonens: no more MGS PLEASE
[2017-01-07 20:29:29 UTC] bethe2670: metal gear series would be good
[2017-01-07 20:29:42 UTC] bethe2670: no he is ill
[2017-01-07 20:29:42 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: Yeah do MGS again lmao
[2017-01-07 20:29:43 UTC] splitplaythru: DSP also didn't beat Demon Souls legit.
[2017-01-07 20:29:49 UTC] podusmonens: DS made Phil, MGS RUINED him
[2017-01-07 20:29:54 UTC] splitplaythru: He should replay that as well.
[2017-01-07 20:30:02 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: He should redo DeS
[2017-01-07 20:30:10 UTC] goldencolts: I'm just holding out for that game starring al pacino: the redemption run Kappa
[2017-01-07 20:30:13 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: He cheesed the fuck out of that game like a pussy
[2017-01-07 20:30:18 UTC] deltaforce355: why is that dragin?
[2017-01-07 20:30:21 UTC] bethe2670: no no i dont need another souls game
[2017-01-07 20:30:23 UTC] bethe2670: nope
[2017-01-07 20:30:32 UTC] podusmonens: he got most of the hate for the MGS stuff
[2017-01-07 20:30:34 UTC] bethe2670: nioh coming soon too i dont need it
[2017-01-07 20:30:42 UTC] podusmonens: hardcore fans of that game got enraged
[2017-01-07 20:30:50 UTC] splitplaythru: Tower Knight battle in Demon Souls was the cringiest excusefest I've witnessed.
[2017-01-07 20:31:01 UTC] bethe2670: and thus the sons of kojima were born too dragin
[2017-01-07 20:31:02 UTC] podusmonens: that's where all the kojima shit started
[2017-01-07 20:31:02 UTC] deltaforce355: gino is online now
[2017-01-07 20:31:07 UTC] podusmonens: yeah
[2017-01-07 20:31:24 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: Play MGS3 again, that shit was hilarious
[2017-01-07 20:31:30 UTC] theycallmejimbob: You're right dragin but it would bring in the viewers imo
[2017-01-07 20:32:02 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: Fukken Kojeemuh
[2017-01-07 20:32:07 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: fukken hack
[2017-01-07 20:32:33 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Watching Phil play Dark Souls again makes me want to install Dark Souls on my PC and play it again.
[2017-01-07 20:32:58 UTC] podusmonens: doo 33t lemon
[2017-01-07 20:32:58 UTC] goldencolts: thats strange
[2017-01-07 20:33:05 UTC] podusmonens: do you have it in your steam library?
[2017-01-07 20:33:18 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I do, I have to find the DSfix mod though. I refuse to play it w/o that mod.
[2017-01-07 20:33:31 UTC] podusmonens: what does the mod do?
[2017-01-07 20:33:38 UTC] deltaforce355: fix stuff?
[2017-01-07 20:33:40 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: I've been playing my first run the past few weeks and I only have two bosses left
[2017-01-07 20:33:52 UTC] lemonplaysgames: It makes Dark Souls what it should have been when it was first ported.
[2017-01-07 20:33:52 UTC] deltaforce355: cuz DS(FIX)
[2017-01-07 20:34:05 UTC] lemonplaysgames: 60 fps unlock, allows you to play it in a higher resolution than 720p, proper anti aliasing, etc.
[2017-01-07 20:34:07 UTC] podusmonens: yeah but what specifically
[2017-01-07 20:34:15 UTC] theycallmejimbob: I have DS1 and 2 on steam haven't played either, that's one bad thing about steam so many bundles you acquire quite a backlog
[2017-01-07 20:34:16 UTC] podusmonens: gotcha
[2017-01-07 20:34:57 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: They're alright if you like these kinds of games. I'm more partial to DeS because its not as confusing and the worlds are better designed IMO
[2017-01-07 20:35:12 UTC] lemonplaysgames: I wish Sony would green light a remaster for Demon's Souls./
[2017-01-07 20:35:13 UTC] deltaforce355: mods makes stuff better
[2017-01-07 20:35:18 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Would love to play that in 1080, 60 fps.
[2017-01-07 20:35:26 UTC] podusmonens: not always delta
[2017-01-07 20:35:26 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: If they did I'd buy a PS4
[2017-01-07 20:35:49 UTC] taurusoxford: I wouldn't be able to play demon's souls again unless it got the QOL improvements of the later games
[2017-01-07 20:36:03 UTC] taurusoxford: like, item burden can go away
[2017-01-07 20:36:06 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: I still have a huge PS3 backlog though, and I want to try and beat the DaS series, DS1 has not been fun for me though so I may drop it
[2017-01-07 20:36:13 UTC] podusmonens: so... he didn't tweet he is not streaming, he must be in bed, sick
[2017-01-07 20:36:41 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: Did he say he was completely better yesterday?
[2017-01-07 20:36:48 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Dark Souls 1 is probably my favorite. Demon's Souls is probably the hardest out of the series imo.
[2017-01-07 20:37:04 UTC] podusmonens: yes cray but now he says leanna got him sick again
[2017-01-07 20:37:11 UTC] lemonplaysgames: @TaurusOxford, Item burden was pretty lame, glad they got rid of that.
[2017-01-07 20:37:15 UTC] podusmonens: something she got from work
[2017-01-07 20:37:24 UTC] goldencolts: does leanna work at the ebola clinic
[2017-01-07 20:37:24 UTC] lemonplaysgames: Whenever I play a game w/ a weight limit, I always disable it.
[2017-01-07 20:37:29 UTC] podusmonens: lol
[2017-01-07 20:38:02 UTC] goldencolts: sorry just joshin lol
[2017-01-07 20:38:04 UTC] podusmonens: some people like the weigh limit, kakes it hardcore bruh
[2017-01-07 20:38:10 UTC] buffetcrayfish3: Really? DeS? It seemed pretty easy to me, or I was just overestimating it. I played a heavy tower knight, which there's no way I could get away with in DaS
[2017-01-07 20:38:10 UTC] podusmonens: makes*
[2017-01-07 20:39:09 UTC] podusmonens: bethe left

[2017-01-07 21:07:16 UTC] theycallmejimbob: he said it costs 500 bucks for a doctor's visit,so he couldn't afford to go iirc
[2017-01-07 21:07:43 UTC] marcusdoesgaming: and if he does go he wants the viewers to pay him 500$ since his insurance won;'t cover it
[2017-01-07 21:18:34 UTC] rapclone27: Rather pay for a doctor visit than a "staycation"

[2017-01-07 21:33:41 UTC] theycallmejimbob: Phil ‚Äè@TheyCallMeDSP 5h5 hours agoThere's absolutely no way I can stream today unless my throat improves. Sorry all, I want more Dark Souls as much as you do, and now this.
[2017-01-07 21:35:19 UTC] misterfister75: honestly, the fat slob should just see a doctor, no way does it cost $500 for a doctor to flash a light in his mouth and prescribe antibiotics
[2017-01-07 21:35:22 UTC] misterfister75: moron
[2017-01-07 21:58:51 UTC] taurusoxford: Maybe instead of Washington, Phil should have moved to Canada - free healthcare
[2017-01-07 22:06:32 UTC] taurusoxford: the salt water would probably cure his snorting too
